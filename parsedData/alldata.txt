[native] i 'm not saying that europe is especially racist , but no one doubts that individuals making comments about `` urban youths '' and `` melanin enriched individuals '' in american centric threads are being racist , but comments about the roma and asylum-seekers seem to be a-okay in this sub .
[non-native] second , most ads make some particular products seem better then they are and even if they are extremely expensive , especially female customers may afford to buy any cosmetique product such as powders , creams , lashes or perfumes without checking their essential needs or the utility of that product .
[non-native] its qualities as a general statement are certainly lacking .i belive that travel with a group led by a tour guide is so important and nice becoues there a lot of dangras places in the word and also maby u dont know the city vare good .
[non-native] to conclude , young people should be taught to engage in more community activities which will help them to understand an important part of lives , which is to help others to make the society more beautiful .i agree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many acadamic subjects is important a student up to his secondary school level , that is up to his ten plus two level .
[native] the elites create a set of rules which impose an ever growing burden of tribute which grows ever more outrageous until the common people convulse with anger and shake that batch off , installing `` reformers '' who over the space of several generations become corrupt in turn and then the whole process repeats again .
[native] personally , in today 's world where you live in some apartment in a town you did n't grow up in and you drive your car to some other town to work , i do n't see how you can actually form any sense of community at all .
[native] it might also be worth noting , absent any other information , that cepr is * the most * renowned and respected economic think tank in europe , primarily funded by central banks and staffed by university professors , whilst the capaldo is just a phd student .
[native] italy 's northern border is defined by the alps : arbitrary line [ here 's an image of us states that have borders defined by rivers ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:us_states_riverine_borders.jpg ) the rhine between france and germany ; completely and utterly arbitrary and , obviously , as the other guy said , tectonic plates do n't define continents .
[non-native] in last two decades the sales of cars has continuously shown upwar trend , right from small segment to large segment cars sales has increased and it is predicted that the trend will continue and so will be the increase in use of cars for coming decades .
[non-native] if the programmer knows only facts on which command leads to which result then he wil face problem in the upgraded version but if he knows the concept on which procedure the compliler works then he can also use the upgraded version though with some difficulty in the beginning .
[non-native] thus in my opinion a person who is older would be leading a more content life and would enjoy his life much more for the reason that he has time to pursue his passions and also the financial independence to do so , both of which might be a hindrance in the case of young people .some people often discus that old people enjoy life more than young people however i strongly believe that young people more enjoy thieir life than old people because they 're more heathy it means they have more opportunity and time
[native] right and you can either have an alliance of nations with trade agreements that still maintain sovereignty and identity of their nation or you can try and force a large centralized state with a primary culture and language and `` romanize '' the rest of the population and make them abandon their identity .
[non-native] if youth donot find time in helping communities then how these many communities are there , every community has its own passion , they have different cultures , they have many aims to their credit people often participatein community meetings .i do agree to the statement `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' in many ways here are the some
[non-native] another quit good example is the group of some pupils who meet older people / seniors during christmas-time for giving some hope and the feeling of being part of the society and i personally think that this is a great supportment for the whole community in a city .
[non-native] indeed , a host of countries which are nowadays in development , may reach their maturity in these twenty years -- for instance , when the asian world , such as china or india , will be considered as industrialized countries , i suppose that an indian or a chinese car constructor would be next to the toyota 's rank -- a car major companie .
[non-native] in a global world today , we also get benefits from advertisements .glance through a piece of newspapers and you will in all likelikhood see news concerned with the future trends of such careers as accountants , lawyers , doctors , and so on .
[native] it also will make countries think twice about negotiating a fta with the eu , spending all that time and money and effort only to have it shot down by one of the 28 ( soon to be 27 ) nations that all need to ratify it .
[native] if it were n't for her blue collar neighbours , aussies whose families had been living there for at least three generations , inviting her over to events with them often , despite her absolutely atrocious english , teaching her the morals and values of australian society , she would 've probably ended up just hanging out with people who were from her country .
[non-native] for example , a student can easily get what happened in canada in 1870 from the internet , he or she just simply type : `` what happened in canada in 1870 '' , he or she can get thousands of ariticles and tests which are related to the topic .
[non-native] based on those above points , i think it 's better for a morden person to specialize on a specific subject to give himself a big change to success as well as change our world .in twenty years , i think there will be more cars in use than there are today due to the development of technology in automobile industry and to the general trend of the statistics versus years .
[native] if you break off from the uk , a conservative party will pop up in scotland and suddenly the relatively-conservative scots who refused point-blank to vote for thatcher 's party will remember they have principles , and vote for the most tory-esque party that emerges .
[native] they were n't bloody joking when they called it `` operation unthinkable '' people seem to think the nukes were the answer to life 's problems , but the allies would 've gotten their shit kicked in by the red army in europe no matter how many nukes they dropped in russia .
[non-native] because of the more and more competitive educational circumstance , young people are indused to spend a great deal of time on study and preparing for exams , decreasing their concerning about other things such as family chore , community activities , to name a few .
[native] however , there 's also a large lobby group of parents who do n't like their children being able to view such things felt that most internet service providers did not do enough to help them `` protect ' their children from such influences .
[non-native] to conclude , i would say that doing new things and taking risks is totally necessary for the individual to face the diferent sides of his personality , but they do not always match with being successful in the social meaninf of the word .the issue of knowing many academic subjects or to be specialized in a specific one is difficult to deal with .
[native] he was hoping cameron would bring back a fundamental change in the relationship between britain and europe ; that britain was n't to be part of the european project , but an associate member that managed it 's own affairs but remained in the common market .

[native] there , now i 've stooped to your level and we 're both being childish and all of a sudden this entire topic is derailed because you do n't know how to shut the fuck up and accept criticism and downvote everyone that objects .
[non-native] if he knows that french people was almost starving while the queen made costume-parties at palace , he may be able to understand why the furious inhabitants of paris took `` la bastille '' , france 's most important jail and , consequently , he will remember easily the fact itself : the assault of `` la bastille '' .
[non-native] a hint that supports this point is the fact that a lot of huge car companies invested a lot of money in the developing regions of the world because it 's obvious that the future market for cars lies in these countries due to the huge amount of people that still do not own cars .i totally disagree with this statement .
[native] the western powers were not dictatorships , they were and are democracies , and the people of those countries would not have suddenly acquiesced to fighting a nation that had up to that point been their valuable allies who did the brunt of the fighting against the nazi forces .
[native] although the rules on `` indirect expropriation '' and isds seem to prohibit increases in minimum wages after an fta is signed , there is no prohibition against lowering them , so its possible that lowered minimum wages and benefits may become common , as suuply increases and demand is falling due to huge improvements in labor saving technology .
[native] do you guys think russia is all like , chip chip cheerio absorb ukraine which has been in our sphere-of-influence for centuries & deprive us of a member-state for our eurasian union while simultaneously seriously cutting down our influence in eastern europe please european union .
[non-native] this stament greatly works in the case of computer programmers , computer programmers are always confronted with the task of finding newer ways to program in order to increase the efficiency and throughput of the target systems , and so the most successful men for instance microsoft have always been ones those who did things differently .
[non-native] more and more countries nowadays use cars : in china , for example , the car industry is in great development , and as there are really many inhabitants , we must consider that it will be one of the most attractive market in a few years .
[native] if people want to leave your country you need to ask some hard questions about why that is , if people feel more european than a part of cyprus , then again , you need to ask some questions about what kind of society permits the level of hatred that can make someone want to abandon their own birthplace and nationality .
[native] i thought it was a constitutional issue , that the estonian government ca n't take away the citizenship of someone born in estonia , so if an estonian wants to get a second citizenship there 's nothing much that can be done about it .
[non-native] let me put this in another way , if one wants to go to work and he/she wants to take the bus , first he/she must wait for the bus to arrive , and when the bus arrives he/she must check if the bus is full or not and after taking the bus and arriving to work , he/she will pay for the ride which annoy most of the people .
[non-native] of course people are searching for other energy resources for cars like solar energy , and there are cars working with solar energy , but those technologies are far away from today and most probably in 20 years they would still be unusable in real life situations as the engineers believe in so .
[native] us car companies ( along with any japanese and european ones ) that wanted to sell over here in north america needed to meet those limits , which forced them all to change how they built cars and the engines that go in them .
[native] this is n't to say that the other countries were not at fault , loading the gun and pulling the trigger are two different but equally important acts , and in the same manner , germany who was the first to flout economic regulations , and acted in a totally selfish manner when it came to several economic matters , helped set up the conditions in which countries such as greece , italy and ireland could have acted with irresponsibility in the first place .
[non-native] infact a society must to send us a message that is fondamental for its life : that his product or service is good , or however really better in comparison with the ones made by the concurrency , and that we need absolutely it .
[native] not only was it filled with blatant victim blaming , it 's extremely clear that the writer has not only never been raped , but also he/she has absolutely no sympathy for those who are rape survivors , and who also want to play online games like the rest of us without being constantly reminded of an event in their life where they were subjugated and sexually abused by someone much more powerful than themselves .
[native] i 'm not a cypriot or greek so it does n't really bother me on a personal level , i just find it ridiculous that the world is pointing fingers at russia while a nato member and eu `` hopeful '' is still militarily occupying over a third of an eu country , and at the same time many have the audacity to get angry at cyprus whenever they boast relations with russia , when obviously the eu or nato does n't give a shit about them .
[non-native] so , why being closed-minded and focused on one thing we suppose the best for us when there is too many fascinating things to know ?* in my opinion it is better to specialize on one subject rather than many academic subjects but at the same time we should have a little basic knowledge about the other subjects too .
[non-native] i strongly believe that all areas of knowledge complete each other , so if a person knows about math , science , history , art , music , language and other areas of knowledge , he will be able to view life and its different situations in a better way than a person who is narrow minded by only one specific subject .
[native] not sure why the down-votes , i am not advocating them being picked up , i am illustrating that you cant expect people to fear death and turn back just because they come to a body of water , when they have already faced death and hardship in other forms earlier in the journey .
[native] > the former general , who was overall commander of polish land troops in the past and is ** currently deputy defense minister responsible for defense procurement ** , is a known advocate of having a strong polish army and being on guard for possible russian aggression .
[native] > the courts at all three levels noted that the case of accidental contamination beyond the farmer 's control was not under consideration but rather that mr. schmeiser 's action of having identified , isolated and saved the roundup-resistant seed placed the case in a different category yeah , sounds totally evil of monsanto ...
[native] essentially , the shale gas countries ( uk , poland , hungary and the czech republic ) have made it clear to the commission through lobbying that they wo n't support binding targets - and since the commission only * proposes * legislation , the best it can do under such circumstances is to put forward non-binding recommendations .
[non-native] for example , honey mooners are not likely to be keen to travel within groups let alone having a tour guide with them most of the time since privacy is valuable and treasured by newly weds and even couples seeking to spend quality romantic times together .
[non-native] for example , at schools , we all learn about theories and formulas that were invented to use to resolve problems , and that 's what we do at schools , we make a simulation of some problems that can be resolved with those tools .
[native] as mentioned earlier in my original post on this thread , ireland has a lot going for it that is unconnected to the eu ( language , highly educated workforce , good legal system , business-friendly tax system ) ... what was astonishing about ireland was that it was relatively slow to boom , when the rest of its anglophone peers succeeded .
[non-native] so i have to become older and maybe then i will be able to answer this question in a better way .i personally agree with the statement that `` it is important to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts '' . cause it is enough for a student to understand the ideas and concepts .
[native] basically , this study says that only one city in the largest economy by far in the world belongs within the top 20 global cities , while 10 cities in europe ( combining for a similar economic size ) make it into the top 20 .
[non-native] for instance , if you have seen a stone falling down from the top floor of a building you know that when you throught a stone from a high place , the stone falls down , but you do not why what phisical aspects caused it .
[native] perhaps not related to this post but i have noticed that a lot of my fellow irish people gladly call ireland `` a shit hole '' and other pleasant terms yet have never lived in another country or travelled anywhere other than to tourist enclaves in spain .
[native] however , many commercial contracts and financing contracts ( including between sovereign entities ) have provisions in them that are along the lines of the following : `` a party is not liable for failure to perform the party 's obligations if such failure is as a result of acts of god ( including fire , flood , earthquake , storm , hurricane or other natural disaster ) , war , invasion , act of foreign enemies , hostilities ( regardless of whether war is declared ) , civil war , rebellion , revolution , insurrection , military or usurped power or confiscation , terrorist activities , nationalisation , government sanction , blockage , embargo , labor dispute , strike , lockout or interruption or failure of electricity or telephone service ... '' these provisions are specifically designed to ensure that in certain circumstances the contract does not need to be honoured and ( as a lawyer i would always insist that my client includes some kind of clause like this in their contracts ) .
[non-native] for these reasons , i think it is better to know wide range of academic subjects .the agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today because of the scarcity of fuel needed to run the cars and the awareness created about the amount of pollution these vehicles cause .
[native] also to close the strait they do n't have to physically close it , a crew served missile launched from hidden tunnels/caches/bunkers will cripple any tanker it hits , simply having the ability to do this is enough to stop them sending tankers through .
[native] > they 're a low chalk escarpment , which tends to mean pretty excellent water -- the water is filtered really well through the bedrock , the slight alkalinity can depress the microbial population a bit , and streams tend to be relatively broad and shallow with very low turbidity , which means excellent uv exposure and fewer bugs .
[non-native] once they operate the computer and connect the internet , they can be , they can work , they can shop , they can chat with friends , they can take classes , they can do anything they do in the real life outside .
[native] it depends what we mean by spirituality , what i have in mind by the term is belief in non-observable forces and entities but i can see that it is often also extended to philosophies that try to come to grips with existential issues but i did n't have such a meaning in mind .
[native] the commission should also ensure that nothing in the agreement prevents the parties from applying their national law , regulations and requirements regarding entry and stay , ** provided that , in doing so , they do not nullify or impair the benefits accruing from the agreement ** .
[native] even now , with economies contracting , germany is still obsessed with deficit reduction for all governments , while its opposition to monetary easing has meant that the ecb , to the obvious despair of mr draghi , has done far less than other big central banks in terms of quantitative easing ( notwithstanding this week 's move to start buying `` covered bonds '' ) .
[non-native] this is obviously against the nature of the travel , we need more time to talk to people and share the wisdom of life , which seems a tough and even impossible task for the tour guide , since to some extent , they had to follow the simple principle , time is money .
[non-native] for instance , every human science tries to explain how human beings behave in a society : economy , philosophy , psychology , anthropology , they all give us a different theory about the way we choose , decide , react in our environment .
[native] they are also attacking the pyd in syria , so this chart is n't completely correct , yet turkish shills are doing their best in this thread to make it look like turkey is only against a small group of kurds , the largest group outside of the government in syria who is doing anything meaningful against isis and other terrorists groups .
[native] there are indoor growers but it 's hard to get because all the bush weed is n't soaking up demand , most weed you get at the moment is shit stuff , tinnies are $ 25 instead of $ 20 , or you only get 0.8 g tinnies for $ 20 , i 've had worse than that .
[non-native] but owning a car is - and will always be - a pride and a feature of independence , which leads me to assume that cars have a bright future .the situation of learnning simplely but deeply or widely is a thing depends on the time .
[non-native] in one hand , f you go by your self , you can arrange your time whatever you want , so you will be free to choose when you want to do one thing or another ; in the other hand , if you choose to go with an already confomed tourist group you can also enjoy to be with another people and have the chance to meet different persons and maybe different cultures than yours .
[native] i believe we do need to have a tough immigration policy because , yes , people do die at sea trying to come to australia , and also , lets be honest , if we did let everyone in , many many many people would come because australia is amazing ( most of the time ) .
[non-native] for example i can talk about the tooth paste that is presented more and more contolled by tests to grant security , or i can think about any other product that reguard our sanity and needs to be tested clinically and that advertisement demonstrate : i use a very great quantity of creams that i buy only with the granted name of a famous beauty factory , and this security in my shopping is given by advertisements that states their good proprieties , year by year .
[native] this would go a way towards helping to solve this , but would bring back all the problems that lead to the founding of the euro in the first place - and yes , that was a very political move but it did have its reasons .
[native] > even if in germany the german names for the cities are still the names that are used til , i thought germany would walk down from that , but given germany 's current global position , i 'm guessing it 's too late now .
[native] obviously i think the political manifestation of islam is absolutely horrific and we should work to depose isis and those like them and we should never be afraid to criticise a culture or religion but we should make sure we 're not playing into their hands .
[non-native] they all will be count the number of cars which will not decline the next - at least - 20 years .i do agree , the best way to travel is in group led by a tour guide , because even if you know the place where you are traveling , you still get very good deals at traveling fares , hotel discounts and special admission discounts on events that are going in the city where you are visiting .
[native] `` we have to accept that , because of berlin 's specific relationship with russia , we can not count on germany in matters of regional security , '' he writes , * adding that germany is treating russia `` like a special needs child who has to be raised without stress '' .
[native] buses in the uk ( except in london ) are not regulated , anyone can set a route wherever they want and charge what they like , consequently buses in leeds are more expensive than continental cities ( even london ) so i do n't tend to use them , its cheaper to share a taxi with three/four people if you 're going out so i tend to do that .
[non-native] the whole point is that as a younger person , we are at an immature stage in our lives and things may not affect us that adversely and this is a big advantage and a huge motivational factor to go out and try different things .
[native] well if you understood that , then the most logical conclusion is that you 're too stupid to understand that they achieve * different outcomes in different circumstances * , as , for example , in the difference between voting on legislation and voting in an election , which was my point and had nothing to do with historical meanings of the word , but rather what it meant in this specific example .
[native] exactly , and you did n't go into specifics on purpose , to uphold the guise that * all * allegations are false ( exemplified by your final sentence pertaining to ` they 're just looking for excuses to paint her as a criminal ' .
[non-native] however , it might be in some cases disadvantageous , as it would be a waste of money , as in the case of the hair remover .i am totally agree with this statement , i think that always the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are and this is because that is the intention of the advertisements .
[native] i was struck by this vision of community/crowdsourced translations of bits of wikipedia pages , to grow the esperanto wikipedia - like , a few sentences from a page each day , and then eventually i 'd stick 'em all together and upload the whole article .
[non-native] as a results , learning about facts and understand the points is most important than just understanding ideas and concepts .i disagree with the statement that young people nowadays donot give enough time to helping their communities.the reasons which i quote for supporting this statement are as follows :
[native] ( i 'd recently been speaking to a friend who 's a less-experienced esperantist who wanted me to correct her on things , and i had to bite my tongue the first time i heard a denaskulo drop an accusative , and get out of that mindset !
[native] gim me a few days to find some time alone to record a few samples ( not sure my flatmates want to hear me belting things out anywhere outside the shower , and not sure you want to hear them watching spanish movies and slamming doors in the background ! )
[native] ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7841890.stm ) ( as one example of many ) you write as though the fda is some banana republic arm of a junta somewhere , and ( as a more general example ) germans tend to write opinions on economics as though the [ deutsche bank had no role in the 2008 global financial crisis .
[non-native] in conclusion , at the present day there are a lot of cars that produce a lot of pollution , but i think that man is more counscious about this problem now as he was in the past , so i think that there will be fewer cars in twentcar-one of the few things which people are proud to posses .
[native] when people ask a question , and you reply with `` your mom '' then your opinion should be taken as worthless because you are either a ) a child 2 ) an idiot 3 ) a stupid child either way , not worth any more of my time .
[non-native] for example there was an advertisement about some food and they chalenge any one who can prove that is the product has any unnatural products so when some peoples do some tests for this product they say it was true the product does not contain any unnatural products .
[non-native] thus , try new things , taking risk may give a improvement of life and happiness .most of people sort some bias aganist traveling , some consider it is more fun to travel alone , but other choose to traval in agroup led by a tour guide .
[non-native] first of all , if somebody wants to travel somewhere certainly she/he must get tour or tour guide because if you have no idea where are you and you need some help from someone this person shoul be your tour guide moreover if you spend a lot money for this travel it is so normal to wants to see important places .
[non-native] so looking at the points mentioned above i am confident to say that young people enjoy life more then older people and among the various points mentioned above i feel that 's health is something thatreally against the older people is their heath .the above statement mentions that `` most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are '' .
[non-native] but at the same time our lives are filled with work and expectations for our futur , that need to be accomplished in the first place for us to go on .i 'm not agree with this sentence for different reasons that emerged from my personal experience .
[non-native] i can say this to my fellow and my younger frineds , that if you guys have wide range of subject then i will encourage you to take it as much as it can , this will surely give you positive way of your style .
[native] i get unlimited paid vacation days ( it 's up to my judgement of course , i would n't be able to take 5 months off because i feel like it ) , my health insurance through my state and employer ( i can double up ) covers pretty much everything .
[non-native] so , according to me i feel that for every student its more important to undestand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .while it is always difficult to make such strong claims and there are for sure some exceptions , i overall agree with the statement .
[non-native] obiously , the way some products are presented in advertisements make them appear better than what they really are : advertisements for pastas always shows them cooked with delicious sauces ; advertisements for burgers always show us big , perfect burgers , whereas everyone knows they do not look at all like this when we go to mac donald 's !
[non-native] as a conlusion i would say that both are importants - ideas and concepts on one hand and facts on the other hands - because they are part of a general process , they do not exclude each other and one without the other is worth nothing .
[native] there was some stuff in there about being historical friends with spain and france , oh and i 'm pretty some locals butchered some shipwrecked spanish sailors for their shoes a few hundred years ago or so but we try not to advertise that too much .
[non-native] but on the contrary , if he starts trying new jobs , specially in something he does n't know anything about , he 's taking too much risks , and he may not succeed as well as if he would have stayed in his domain and specialized himself .
[native] there 's only so much you can do when you 're a country that 's about 5-6 million ( and less if you only count the yes campaign ) against the hundreds of millions that constitute the western nations , some of the most powerful intelligence agencies etc. . . combined with all the influence and economic clout of some of the richest entities in the world .
[native] in other places in central europe i would see allot of brattish behaviour on the roads , for example at a restaurant on a roadside rest stop while i was eating my meal their was this huge commotion because germans would keep parking their cars in the parking spots that are for the truckers .
[native] maybe we could propose creating a new subreddit , / r/europeimmigration , where all posts regarding refugees , immigrants , and so on go so we do n't even have to deal with the issue of racism in this subreddit , we can pretend it 's not filled with bigots and racists - just like we do with europe in general .
[native] and you 're using slander ` republicans are acting like fascists ' , which is obviously not true as they 're not remotely interested in tripartite corporatism , a spiritual nationalism revolving around strength/resistance to pressure nor fascist-totalitarianism ( which is more liberal than authoritarianism and is a completely different concept to the standard definition , see : giovanni gentile 's explanation of ` totalitario ' , which can be found in the ` fundamental ideas ' of the doctrine of fascism ) .
[native] > 4 . the united states of america , the russian federation , and the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland , reaffirm their commitment to seek immediate united nations security council action to provide assistance to ukraine , as a non-nuclear-weapon state party to the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , if ukraine should become a victim of an act of aggression or an object of a threat of aggression in which nuclear weapons are used .
[non-native] when you think about all the different products offered for your hair , shampoos and such , for which i am very interrested , it becomes impossible to see which one you really want to buy , because they all promise to make your hair beautifull .
[native] plus , it sounds like they 're being paid for their company more than for sex , i mean why would someone pay so much money for sex when they could just go to a brothel and fuck someone for a fraction of the price ?
[native] far left parties everywhere are getting stronger , if not in the voting polls than with grass roots support , and as voter apathy maintains , these parties will be able to attract larger voting bases that * will * go out and vote for them in elections .
[non-native] to conclude , i give importance to both points of view , becaude ideas and concept are essential to start life well , but the facts will remain the best thing we can learn because the experience will always be the most important ressource for each !my altitude toward advertisemets have changed .
[non-native] to end my paper i want to decair my adversion to tour guide vacation , you spend more and enjoy less .in my opinion i generally believe when people want to be successful in their life they have to try out new things and take risks .
[native] it 's dressed up in terms of equality or social justice or `` deciding our own way '' but most of the major secessionist movements in europe ultimately come down to the idea that there 's more money going alone than there is as part of the whole .
[non-native] consequently , managing concepts and with their interaction reaching conclusion is much more productive than memorizing loads of books .well according to the question if i am agree or disagree the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
[native] what the west needs to do is provide a credible counterpoint using homegrown moderate islamic clerics to provide more western interpretations as a guideline for muslims to follow , instead of leaving it up to councils from much more extreme muslim countries to try and set the tone .
[non-native] for me , the adventure and liberty in decision are important to travel .i agree with the statement , i think that for the students is more important understand ideas and concepts , because when a person understand ideas ( he or she ) can applicate this in real life or can teach to ather people that concept .
[native] you 're being proud of being american and you 're proud of being texan , but you do n't want to be associated with the far right stereotype that often comes with being texan and therefore call yourself american over texan , even though you like being texan .
[non-native] the companies are trying to attract consumers by showing them false attributes of the products and by this way the companies will have to replant their advertisments , because it would cause damage in their image and the people will not buy again their products .academic knoweledge is very important to each individual in our days in the society .
[non-native] mostly old age people by this time are free from their family liabilities , there children are well settled and they have not worry about them , they can spend there money completely accoring to there wish and do every thing that they once wanted to do in their l on the other hand the of so called energetic young person is loses a lot of his energy fighting and keeping himself up in the cutting age competition .
[native] iran and venezuela might not have a gun to their heads yet , but they are definetely in the crosshairs of the u.s. ; especially iran , for many years now has been the apparent next big target that america wants to `` liberate '' .
[native] other than that , i 'd say one of the people most widely admired is michael collins - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/michael_collins_ ( irish_leader ) - who essentially went to negotiate with rebels knowing they 'd try to kill him , because he wanted to `` take the gun out of irish politics '' .
[non-native] population rise , the development of alternative fuels and the rapid economic development in countries with large populations will contribute to an increase in the number of people able and willing to afford their own car and thus to an increase in the number of cars in use .i agree with the statement , that young people do not give enough time helping their communities .
[non-native] in order to decrease the number of cars in use , people must be offered something new and better to use .one day i woke up i heard my dad fighting with my mom for who takes the car and goes to work and the other to go by a cap , from that reason my dad bought to my mom a car so i disagree that will be fewer cars in the coming twenty years .
[native] books like this make it out as if lgb people could n't have normal lives in this world , so they make up a fantasy place where all the virtually non-existent problems do n't exist and that is what makes it magical or something .
[native] it 's about that diesels take much longer to warm up ( thanks to better burning efficiency ) , so the engine does n't get a lot of `` warmed up '' time ... but it 's mostly about dpf , short distances kill those things .
[native] there was an interesting factoid i heard for the 1992 uk general election , which was that ~ 30 % of the electorate who voted , decided who they were voting for in * in the last 7 days * before the election was due , and an additional 5 % made up their mind * on the day * .
[native] * pacifist propaganda usually boils down to saying that * one side is as bad as the other * , but if one looks closely at the writing of the younger intellectual pacifists , one finds that ** they do not by any means express impartial disapproval ** but are directed almost entirely against ** britain and the united states ** .
[non-native] no only did i prefer to agree with this point , but also i were a witness , too .nowadays making new things is not so easy ; we live in an hyper-technological society where most of the things we have to do every day are assisted , controlled and in some cases partially performed by on or some technological devices .
[non-native] at that point , i know that people not necessarily have a lot of money to live more enjoyably but money has a considerable effect on well being and more money means more opportunities to evaluate to have fun or to enjoyment in life .
[native] outside germanic the only instance of this formation is in lithuanian , which uses - lika `` left over '' and continues the series to 19 ( vienio-lika `` eleven , '' dvy-lika `` twelve , '' try-lika `` thirteen , '' keturio-lika `` fourteen , '' etc. )
[non-native] for example if a chemistry student tries to teach physics then he surely be less effective in explaining every point because he has only limited knowledge of the subject , this will be harmful for the students he is addresing and this is quite possible that something wrong can be construed from his teachings .
[non-native] there are a lot of products that seem to be much better than they really are but with that kind of plubicity we cant denied to buy it so we buy it and we tried it but we have to beware about what it is and what it has made of so we cant have that type of problem .knowledge is an important thing for a person 's life .
[non-native] plus , a way to travel can be associated with the personality you have , because if you are a person who likes the adventure you might want to travel alone , without any plann at all , so in this way you just need to pack a small bag and have enough money to eat .
[native] before anyone asks what requirements they do n't have a central bank , which would also need a new currency , which then kicks off the requirement that they can prove they can `` withstand the pressures both within and without the eu '' .
[native] i 'm also a strong proponent of the eu principle of subsidiarity , but i 'd take it further and say it should go to subnational units , rather than national , though i 'll fairly admit i 'm in the considerable minority when it comes to this subject .
[non-native] however now , once a year , during a spring event people clean for free those riversides , and in few years it became a nice river where some people start even to fish , something that was unbeliveable until about ten years ago .
[non-native] i consider much of the advertising companies an obstacle in face of the true human progress .i totally agree with people who have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , because there are some reasons why it is better than to specialize in one specific subject .
[native] my parents would also have been some of the people you * de facto * condemned to death on the other side of the border , but fuck them right , i guess they just ran shit out of luck because they were born on the wrong side of the mediterranean .
[native] i could not care less if someone is brown or romanian who immigrates to the uk provided that there is an economic need for them and they come to work and that the uk has the infrastructure to accommodate them and they respect the uk 's values .
[native] `` on the other hand imports and holidays abroad are getting more expensive with a weaker currency which harms common citizens '' it would if german holiday destinations were n't normally southern europe ... who just so happen to be desperate enough for business to lower their prices to keep their businesses afloat .
[native] some examples : * `` monarch in talks with pm '' * `` osborne warns scots ... '' * `` queen in talks with cameron '' and `` rush to produce timetable ... '' ( its westminster producing this timetable ) * '' ... george osborne promises more devolution powers ... '' * `` westminster parties unite over scotland '' * `` leaders pledge to fast track further devolution '' this has relevance to the entire uk ( though its absolutely scotland 's decision alone ) , hence why its in the newspapers across the uk .
[native] the phrasing of the issue as `` fighting against equality '' presupposes precisely what is in question , though : if the pro-same sex marriage side are correct that marriage is between two people , then the law ought to be changed to reflect that ethical reality .
[native] but put that into the light of the study i first linked to ( cvs with swedish names vs non-swedish that showed that swedes were twice as likely to get interviews ) and i think there 's a strong case for a good deal of that discrepancy down to implicit xenophobia .
[non-native] student who understanding the ideas and concepts this makes them to achive major tasks like if we take an example of any experiment in sciences that student should know all the concepts to do that experiment like take example of a frog if the student want to experement a frog he need to know all the respiratery organs and how its lives in water and also on the land if we go just by fast that it can live in water and aslo on land that is not sufficient to do experiment on it this may lead to the death of the frog so one student should have the idea when nd in which condition like at what weather condition it servive on the land on in the water so by knowing this student can experiment it .
[non-native] another type of company is a company who wants to sell its product for 1 time and leave with the profits , so this type of company has to pay alot in a very fansy way of advertising method so the consumer can buy once only .
[native] - rebels argued among themselves whether to agree to a brief cease-fire to allow bodies of victims to be taken to morgues and about a `` fuller international presence at the scene . '' - monitors were given access to the site for 75 minutes .
[non-native] therefore i think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .there are a lot of things that a good student have to do ; indeed , i think that to study in the right way ia a very difficult thing to do .
[native] i do n't think wahabbists and salafists should be let in here just because there 's literally nothing they offer except backwards ideology , unlike the rest of islam , but if we 're going to ban them based on fighting in foreign territories then we should be pretty worried about europeans fighting in israel , ukraine and various other military forces around the world where they 'll be getting trained and radicalized .
[non-native] few concepts are often challenged if they do not have enough support of facts , to name few some of the modern scientists say that there is global warming but other do challenge them , as there is no physical evidence showing that the phenomen is relivent and do exisist
[native] the dialect of siena and surrounding areas of italy is definitely unique : they have difficulty pronouncing a hard ` c ' sound and make it sound like the h in `` hat '' ( so `` coca-cola '' becomes `` hoha-hola '' ) .
[native] there was a lot of fear of civil unrest after the war , war-time patriotism had suppressed a lot of disputes , but if that tolerance ends at the same time as a lot of young men fresh from a terrible war come back to find their jobs `` taken '' behind their back , they might not take it well .
[native] the difference between european culture and american culture in this regard is that most europeans think of any other european country as an equal and so the jokes and making fun for us , does n't have the possibility of have a sinister tone about it .
[native] the ecb intervention came at a time when irish sovereign bond yields were rocketing upwards , deposits were fleeing the banks , and the banks had already borrowed something around $ 100billion from the ecb to pay off the bonds the government had unilaterally guaranteed in 2008 .
[native] from a comment in / r/unitedkingdom > a single retired un official ≠ `` the un '' > edit ( for clarity ) : [ alfred-maurice de zayas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alfred-maurice_de_zayas ) , does currently have a role in the un as an ' ** independent ** expert on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order ' .
[non-native] to conclude , i do agee with the quotation that there will be fewer cars in the next twenty years , but at the same time i say that it would be very costly affair to get the quote right with every individual . .it is good to have knowledge on many academic subjects , however , upto what extent we need that amount of knowledge is questionable .
[native] i think it 's more than likely that the economy will correct these difficulties in the long-term -- prices will probably rise at first but then they will go down , and professions will be able to capitalize on specialized labour if the demand exists ( and certainly there is perpetual need in some fields , like medicine ) -- but the situation might not be particularly enviable at first .
[native] i might 've mischaracterized the situation before with the * `` much smaller '' * logistical footprint comment , but i do n't know the exact specifics so i ca n't say , although * i do know * the less fuel you need , the more food you have & the less targets * ( resupply ships ) * you give the enemy is not something you should underestimate in a conflict .
[native] even having an ancestor history of being ` australian ' for hundreds of years i was still ` english ' to my friends mum , who like her son was born in australia but was still as ` greek ' as ever a greek could be , because her parents were greek .
[non-native] i think that this is true because now everithing is linked to one another , you may find many things that are related to your job but are not the base of your focus , this will force you to adapt to the problem in matter .
[non-native] it does not matter whether science advances so far as to transport a person from one point to other through virtual domain but science would have certainly progressed enough to discourage people from using cars by providing them with ample of other transportation facilities which would finally lead to a reduction in number of cars in use twenty years later then there are today .nowadays , people argue that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
[non-native] finally each of the car & internet services have their advantages & disadvantages , i believe in twenty years there will be modern technolog service more that the cars & internt also .i agree with that young people enjoy life more than older people ,
[native] i 'm also saying that devaluing the eur relative to usd is neutral as regards italy 's ability to service its debts as the the devuation of the eur to usd impacts the size of the debt and the size of the gdp in the same way .
[non-native] eventhough you can get some knowledge from books and internet about the cities and important places , tour guides give you the exact information you need to know such as theorical facts but also myths , leyends and beliefs , which many times are more interesting and not found in books .
[non-native] in certain cases luck does not favour us even though we worked hardly to achive our goals , though we trust our hard work and self confidence some times things go wrong when we were trying to achieve success by single trail it self .
[non-native] people say that the communiteis and the culture is built on there young people hands and that explains that young people have lots of enjoiable things that they live for and old people must give the cahnce for the young people becuse they had theier own chance .students education should be complete in order to let young people develop their own way of thinking in all the majors like maths , physics , psicology and art .
[non-native] to sum up , in my opinion expenses of car usage , environmental problems that car usage cause and developing alternatives to the cars with improved technology will cause a reduction in car usage in twenty years .i believe learning ideas and concepts is far more rewarding for students than only learning a bunch of meaningless facts .
[native] other people have made some very good points , one thing i 'd like to add about litterbox training ... if you find she piddles on the couch/bed etc , it 's cause bunnies like to go up out of their burrow to pee ... if you raise her litterbox off the ground a little , it might help her feel good about going up to pee ... got ta let her fulfill her instincts :)
[non-native] for conclusion , i think if you want to be successful , you should be creative enough to undertake the risks that can be follow your creativity , because in that way , you can have your own solutions to be successful , and that you can learn from the failure if you had failed .from the primary school to the end of highschool , in france , england or in the united states , students learned a significant number of various subject which means they not have to operate a decisive choice in one or two subject they will have to study .
[native] i think it 's just sad that instead of using the council of europe as a tool for putting pressure on governments to improve human rights and democratic freedoms , it seems to be used as a cover to legitimise the behaviour of dodgy regimes .
[non-native] after all , all the concepts are from the real life and they are changing by the experience of fact as time passes .in the present world as their is a rapid change in the development in student in all the aspects i.e in iq , sports , information technology , electornics , media and many other fields and more over in school studies .
[non-native] however , there are still certain examples today of people who have left colleges and their well paying jobs to start some venture to help their community , the example of a famour nri is inspiration for all who left his multi million dollars job to start micro finance project in rural india which has become the first and biggest organisation of such kind .
[non-native] for instance , one one of my friends decided to go to a town that is known not only its water falls but also for mafia groups that it hold and when i advised him to be careful and acompany a tour guide , he refused .
[non-native] so in my opinoun the student who understand ideas and concepts is more important than the students who learn facts so as to face different compitative exams which are likely to held in every part of the life , where they test only the output of the student rather than how much he knows about factsit can not be denied that travel may bring lots of fun and pleasure to the people who travel .
[non-native] the first one would be to travel in a very small group , and to take notes from internet web pages such as www.asmallworld.com which offers opinions from people who actually recommend the best places to go to , and rank them , and even explain the real situation of every country by their own citizens views , one can even talk to them and find out about almost everything there is to know about any city .
[native] while i hate that appealing to the median voter is enough to get elected here in canada under fptp , in new democracies like bosnia or egypt it would really help if political parties tried to find common ground on issues ( say the economy ) that transcends ethnopolitical lines .
[native] so , health care in the usa is not locked up in privatization as they say , because the people have never and would never agree , we 've been [ promised single payer is right around the corner ] ( http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/aug/10/reid-says-obamacare-just-step-toward-eventual-sing/ ) , even as they work [ behind closed doors ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_ppqnbxpa4 ) to cut off any hope of it .
[non-native] the first reason that i agree that there will be fewer cars in the future is the pace of the technolegy which is improve very quickly in the recent years so after twenty years the people will use a vichle more modern than cars .
[non-native] that what they encourage now in the very high standared art schools all over the world , you take few years leaning how to draw and paint and see musumes but the main pat in there plane to make good artists is to give a big space to think .
[native] before long the european commission , the council of europe , the uk government , human rights watch , amnesty international and many other non-governmental and international organisations had all sent their own tweets deploring what they depicted as an attack on free speech .
[native] standing on the sidelines and making statements that have no real bearing on the present conversation but * appear * to introduce doubt in the concerns being raised is an all too common and unfortunately effective way of unjustly dismissing those concerns in people 's minds .
[native] also , this : > many roles were decided on personal favour -- hence how a first world war fighter pilot with no financial experience would be selected to run germany 's attempt at centralised economy , rather than the accomplished and experienced banker hjalmar schacht .
[non-native] in conclusion , people should n't believe all the advertisents they sea in th road or on tv because it 's not true everytimei disagree that , successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
[native] no , this is all russia 's fault , even though isis has lost more territory since the russian campaign in syria started than all the time previous , no , this is just all some ploy by putin to distract from ukraine and not support their biggest ally in the region against terrorists .
[non-native] if we try to make a general analysis about what is beleived in modern societies that succes may bring to a person , the arguments would orbit around phraes like `` money eventually can make you succesful '' , the same thing with fame .
[non-native] second , becouse of the growth of the world and the technological advances poeple are more often expossed to advertisement , and competition has grown , so the only way of wining is by advertising anything , and as long as it sails is fine for any company who needs advertising .
[native] compared to wp ie it has incomparably better tab management , it does not stupidly display each tab as a new process , it has a forward button , it can clear only cookies without wiping the history as well , it has speed-dial page .
[native] so while yes people can set up democratic firms in todays system their attempts are always undermined by the superior resources of the already existing capitalist firms , they will be bought out , pushed aside and undercut by economies of scale far outside their capacity .
[non-native] if we compare the number of the cars present 20 years ago and the cars present now we can see that the number of cars have deen increased , wide variety of cars are now pr4esent in the market and also the feature the the car should have is also improved a lot .
[non-native] even their new project does not work out , they will not be hopeless because they already had their time and they think , in my opinion , that it will come back if they try harder contrary to someone who has never succeeded in something who will take less risks because , if he fails , he will loose everything .
[non-native] the community will never be improved or developed if there is no specialists , and cultures will not be formed if there is no specialists where every person is doing his job to form a beautiful culture finally at the end .i think its true that most of the young people in an age of 20 bi 21 enjoy there live more than wsome old people in an age of 70 bi 75 .
[native] from * the socialist revolution and the right of nations to self-determination * ; > victorious socialism must achieve complete democracy and , consequently , not only bring about the complete equality of nations , but also give effect to the right of oppressed nations to self-determination , i.e. , the right to free political secession .
[non-native] this is by far the preferred method as its intention is not to propagandize or sensationalize ( as would be the case of the first case ) , but to use language in a lyrically enticing form that catches the roll of a tongue or that particular inflection that might season a simple phrase to the point of perfection in the ear of the beholder .
[non-native] the number of cars globally seen will therefore strongly increase during the next 10 years and begin to decrease rapidly in the 2030s .young people nowadays do n't care much about helping their communities , because the do n't have the idea that is , it is imprortant to partcipate in the commuinity social serveses .
[non-native] but in stead of that if i try to understand the philosophical fundaments of the modern movement , the reasons of le corbusier that made him design a diferent kind of building ( never seem untill that year ) and explain the origins and reasons of this architecture i will surely explain to everybody , including mysefl the results of my investigation making not just remember it but know the who , when , and most important of al , the why .
[non-native] for instance , a friend of mine who has a kilo problem , began to use a material advertised as a ` losing calorie miracle in 3 months ' , it has been 6 months and she is not looking lose much more than only 1 kilo . ..
[non-native] i live in cairo , and i believe there will come a time when we will not find a place on ground to have another underground station and i ca n't even imagine where are they going to find space to build more bridges .
[non-native] for example , when you go to buenos aires , argentina , is better that you do it with a tourist agent , because they would take you to the most historical and representative places of the city and you will know their history and learn special information about them .
[native] they drove a toyota echo [ here is one for reference ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/toyota-echo-sedan.jpg ) and they had the back seats removed , extra long rails installed for the seats and double seat belt extenders , tons of empty chip bags and soda bottles ( 2l ) in the back seats .
[native] its in everything about the two , the scope of time and population the regimes took place in , the way in which the killings occurred , the intent of the killings , the targets of the killings , certainly you see the difference between gassing a six year old girl because she comes from a certain ethnic group and shooting a 40 year old man for dissenting against your authoritarian rule , both are horrible but one is certainly worse and of a different nature than the other in my eyes at least .
[non-native] but the line between success and failure is very thin and it always depends on your point of view whether someone is successful or not .i completely disagree with the statement that , most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
[non-native] next time i went with a tour guide and it was fabulous i knew the dynasity the culture and living of people and every detail of the emperor , how they lived and the way they ruled the kingdom , minute to minute detail was covered , which made the trip very fulfilling and informative .
[non-native] for me traveling in a group led by a tour guide is one of the worst and most unconfortable ways of traveling since i am an adventurer and in those kinds of trips it is difficult to get so much flexibility as i like .
[native] for what it 's worth , i used to only buy nokia phones , i prefer fiskars garden tools and buy them for their quality , and i 've collaborated with finnish scientists before , so there 's my investment in the finnish economy .
[native] ** there is scope to protect policy space by including specific exclusions and/or exceptions during negotiation of trade and investment agreements like the tppa , and by strengthening global health frameworks for nutrition to enable them to be used as reference during disputes in trade fora .
[native] - eurosceptics love to pretend that the commission is the whole eu because it is ( admittedly ) the least democratic institution , but the fact is that it can only draw up the first draft of any legislation and is completely powerless to pass laws itself .
[non-native] in many situations we can find a lot a trubles , but is necessary to work very hard with the clear goals in our life , for example to take this test it was for me a new risk in my life , and if this time i can get do it i am ; proud to make my best , i now next time is possible .
[non-native] in conclusions , i find that in every domain of life , one should always try new things and live new experience in order to enrich his life and be successful in it .although it is good to specialize in one subject , i agree with the opinion that people have to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
[non-native] when you get the ideas and concepts you can utilize it and it is easy to apply to various usages or purposes but when you only try to shovel short facts and knowledges into your brain it is highly probable for you to lose the grip of that knowlege and you wo n't retain it long enough to share it with your children or your students .yes i agree that young people do not get time helping their communities .
[native] if you say something inconvenient to the political rulers and the most wildest interpretation of incredibly open-ended and nebulous laws which are not well defined at all unlike the united states of america 's 1st amendment , you can essentially be held as a political prisoner .
[native] we could try make it so it 'd be too economically harmful for them to do anything to us , but that also goes both ways , which is not somewhere we want to be with russia being the way it is right now .
[non-native] to sum up , it is reasonable to conclude that young people have more opportunities than the old ones to enjoy life due to the advanced science and technology , improved economic level as well as some changed culture ideas .i partly inagreement with the statement .
[native] but lloyd george , the british pm , promised that a boundary commission would be set up and that it would be done so that we got most of the land back , which would force the rest of the north to agree to join the free state .
[native] you reply multiple times to a single post , you edit your posts after people have replied to them , you tell people to read books to understand one of your points instead of explaining it yourself , you bring up obscure references without indicating how they link to your point .
[native] granted , there 's a question as to how necessary that ability is , but take libya for example : it was an relatively minor air operation on europe 's doorstep , but france and the uk * still * relied on the us for fairly significant logistical support .
[non-native] the example is that one of my best friend who wants to be a successful medical doctor , he is eightteen years old and he has only one promblem that is facing him and this problem is haveing a good grade in toefl to be accepet in the university , even this is his only problem , he is not working and practicing to have the wanted grade .
[non-native] although some of the advertisements may represent products accurately , the marketing rules lead advertisers to make strong endeavors to represent the product as well as they can to attract the consumer , even if it is not the exact reality .this is a controversial topic since the conditions are different for different countries .
[non-native] in our world today , i think that someone has to be able to discuss or to understand the main academic subjects such as : computer science , business and communication , because i think that they ca n't be understand by someone separetly .
[native] his end goal was to build social democracy on the scandinavian model , `` a socialist beacon for all mankind . '' > at first it seemed that the west also wanted gorbachev to succeed in loosening up the soviet economy and transforming it into something close to sweden 's .
[native] the government has promoted the multicultural aspect of canada so much , that having a family that 's been in canada for generations , i do n't even know what that really means in terms of my identity in the context of the country as a whole going into the future ; i 'm pretty `` typical '' in that i like hockey , maple syrup , the outdoors , i 'm polite , etc.
[non-native] but of course i think that if i had a lot of money and a good job while i am young this will be the best option as i can enjoy travelling , playing soccer matches and practicing some risky activities as climbing mountains and diving .
[native] we had building inspectors and heritage site officials and all sorts in suits with big folders traipsing in and out of the dorm for two weeks , and legend has it , the ex boyfriend was fined $ 4000 ( whether this is true , and if so , whether he appealed it , i can not say ) .
[native] they do n't have the same support networks as locals do ( long standing family and friends , plus in most cases some wealth along with it ) so staying in these communities of people that share common experiences also becomes like an extended support network they can rely on further cementing the ghettoization .
[non-native] here the main aspect in understanding is moving into the deeper meaning of the idea or concept and understanding about the concept it will make the things easier when studied by understanding ideas and concept it will remain in brain for a long time than it is studied according to the studies it has been concluded that most of the students who understand the concept can remember for a long time than we study the facts by understanding the cocnept we can get knowledge about the topic in two ways one is the positive results and the other the negative results from the concept .
[native] there used to be an army base in one of the towns near me that had a decommissioned tank inside the entrance , and twice i was on a school trip when i was 6/7 and 11/12 ish to the place and we got to hold guns and all .
[native] there 's a long-promoted culture of apathy there the likes of which the world has rarely seen , coupled with a self-pitying view of their own history where they somehow think their country has * super * suffered more than anyone else you guys , for real .
[native] it 's normally the most sensitive part of the penis ( [ sorrells , 2007 ] ( http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1464-410x.2006.06685.x/abstract ) -- [ nsfw relevant diagram ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/sorrells.gif ) ) , and the majority of men with intact foreskin agree that it 's the best feeling part of the penis ( [ meislahn & taylor , 2004 ] ( http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4757-4011-0_3 ) ) .
[non-native] to travel with a tour guide is very important because the tour guide know enerything in the city and he knows where is the torist places and where is the shops , museums , restaurant , hotels and alot more things , for example if you travel to a city for the first time and you do n't know about it you wont know where to go and you do n't know where is the tourists places in the city for and where is the good restaurants and museums and it well take you alot of time to know it but if you go with a tour guide he well take to the interesting places in the city and he will explain for you every thing about the city but if you travel alone you wont know where is the inteseting places in the city and also when you go to a country that dont speak your languge who can you talk to the people who can you reed the sings with out the tour guide youin our current society , it is thought that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .
[native] the world is changing and the western world will not be the dominant economic force for much longer ; decisions made in washington , berlin , london , ottawa , canberra , and paris will no longer decide the fate of the global economy .
[non-native] all in all , we can not stop the time , and we should convince in our distiny and fait , we must imagine our selves as we can try to give our age his right in having the rest in the end of our life , and this will not prevent us to try to complete our lives in thinking about the history which we had lived from the young .in the past few decades cars have been the most useful vehicle in the world .
[non-native] so i do not know if young people enjoy life better than older people the only thing i know and i hope for is that everybody enjoys life as much as they can while they still can .a striking feature of the modern world is the explosive growth of information .
[non-native] afterall its not just about completing the task it about compleating it perfectlyit is quite true that the advertisement companies are all over the world today and making a great improvement by enabling the companies to increase the amount of the product they sell and consequently the profit they get .
[non-native] for example , you are a sudent whose major is electronic enginereen moreover you also know some contents about accounting or finance , in this case you have had potential power to own your business in the future because your knowledge is not limited by on specifialize .
[native] personally , i think te reo is an awesome language , it 's so uniquely nz , we got so many of our place names from it , it 's culturally relevant , it 's considered a valuable skill to speak te reo in many jobs ...
[non-native] imagine in mathematics course the student has to understand the idea of parrallellism and the teacher ca n't give a him a real fact or example about parallelism and how two parallel ligns could never meet or in physics he has to understand the concept of the light without giving him a fact how this concept works in reality and what about history course ?
[non-native] studing art , math , history or science allow to people to hav many kind of subjects in thir mind so they could begin many possible works in thir life , and it is a very inportant aspect that we consider for the future .
[non-native] without risk we can not do any thing great and we all people should do something new and find something new and contribute something to world .in a contemporary society , someone who is specialized in one specific subject is more competent , and is more needed than someone who has broad knowledge on general topics .
[native] take a stroll , have some beshoff 's fish and chips on the pier , and finish the night off in the bloody stream pub -- http://howthpathways.com/loopwalks.html - one touristy place that is worth going to is leo burdock 's chipper ( fish and chip shop ) .
[native] the point i was making before was that agriculture needs support now to maintain an educated and advanced workforce that can use modern agricultural practices , so that it does n't require substantial training , education and capital to be recreated in the future when it is economically viable .
[non-native] lastly , learning facts can you learn the communication ability , because when you learn the facts , you probably need to know more details about the facts and you can disscuse and improve that you said it is correct , so you need to explain you ideas to let other peoples know , it good for you to communicate and let you to be a welcome one to them .
[non-native] i think that , besides the decrease in the use of cars in the next two decades , there will be an expand of individuality and a loss of humanity .with the development of society , there are increasing choices to enjoy life as people can play computer games , chat on line , or go to see a live performance etc .
[native] this was something that was repeated by both sides ; a trail of a new , experimental weapon works better than expected , but by the time they 're able to deploy it in force , countermeasures are available and it does n't work nearly as well .
[non-native] indeed , in countries such as india , people ca n't afford a car for every members of a family yet , like it is the case in the united states , but in twenty years the state will be more developped and the citizens might have more money and thus might be able to buy more cars which stay a sort of myth of success .
[non-native] having a broad knowledge is some thing really great from some to get usd from it , it can be very help ful in some positions , for example some people are siting and talking about some field of studing , and they all have a knowledge about many academic subjects exepet one person whose now interested to have aother knowledge of what he have , what if these people opend a subject far from this person field or specific subject , what his position would be like , and what if some of these people askd him about some thing in the other field of his , after that , that person would think that he was wrong about stiking in one specific subject knowing all about it , from that stuiations people change their minds about what they have made .
[native] the tories have raised the amount unis are allowed to charge during this parliament but the initial transition in england and wales from free to priced education was passed by a labour government under blair and it only did so because he had enough scottish labour mps to tip the [ vote ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/west_lothian_question#background ) .
[non-native] in conclusion , with these noticeable benefits of travelling in a group by a tour guide shown above , i strongly believe that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .i strongly agree with this statement that there were very few cars in use twenty years before when compare to today .
[native] i will win if the situation described in the [ resilient societies nrc petition ] ( https://www.nirs.org/reactorwatch/natureandnukes/petrulemaking262011.pdf ) and the greater problem illustrated by fukushima of meltdowns occurring in light water reactors when power is lost for any extended period , is true ... is at its core fundamentally true .
[native] pro-putin americans include : conspiratards who are on the pseudo-left , liberal-left do-gooders who hate us imperialism ( more neutral than pro ) , the for-real stalinist left , some libertarians ( counterpart to liberal-left who also rightfully dislike us interventionism , but who take it too far and believe russian propaganda ) , conservatives who are naturally inclined towards strongmen who attack `` the fags '' and who humiliate obama , neo-nazis , some right-wing jews ( russian jews in brooklyn , mostly ) , fundie muslims , and traditionalist catholics ( who have a whole end-times our lady of fatima thing about russia ) .
[native] the currency union would be best for iscotland and ruk only if you ignore the massive risks involved in underwriting another nations outsize financial sector when you have no control of the governance of such a sector , it also ignores the fact that salmond has declared iscotland would be a direct competitor to ruk .
[non-native] for this reason , i think that everyone should have a global point of view about what is around him , and that a broad knowledge is better than a specialization on a limited , specific subject .there is a prediction that car usage will decline in the future for several reasons .
[non-native] for example , you are playing a game and you reached to the 15th level , that is a success for the first time and your are successful for that instant but if you continue the game and could not go beyond 15th level then you are not successful anymore .
[non-native] finally , i think that what young people is saying about not having enough time to give for their nations is nonsense , because the time is always here but the will and care are not here .from the intotality i would like to cite and support it to my position stating young people enjoy life more than oolder people do .
[non-native] when i go to the larger shopping center i do n't never find to parchege , when i go to the big city i become crazy because the city has became the jungle , i always find queue and the traffic will be always more chaotic .
[non-native] its hard to fail and believe that we have not succeded , we are forced to believe that because we failed some prototype imprinted to us by someone or something , but if we are really whole and concient people , we will see that to fail to ourselves is the only way to fail in life .
[non-native] taking risks and doing something new are the only ways the became a better person in our lives .media in our middle east region and a round the world always speaking about a very hot topic which is come from time to time , this topic is `` the role of young people in supporting their communities '' , i think i am disagree with most of the statement which told that young people nowadays do not give the time to help their communities and i have tow resons for disagree with this statement .
[non-native] we have notce that after the foundiation of the international orgnization in many aspects such as , political , health and social the quality of life has been improved secound it improve sentific movment since it has bult on the base of ideas and knowled finally it is protection of the waild redical ideas which control the socites if there is no fair jujment in my opinion facts will be result of what we belive onpersonally , i think that it is very important for students learning ideas and concepts .
[native] it is indirectly dehumanising people because they protest against a ` fascist-enemy ' persona , and anybody who * says * something that resembles said persona , gets treated as if they 're actually an enemy ; a 'cause r of racial-motivated violence ' .
[non-native] yet have also observed other young people self involved in their day to day life not helping their community either because they do not care or they simply do not have the time as they have other priorities ( play with their friends , go to camp , etc . ) .
[non-native] so if one would like to buy the product only seeing the advertisements , i would like to say the one , ` do not believe most advertisements but be wise and smart consumer ' .advertisements is a important part in selling products and a good advertisements will bring benefits .
[non-native] for instance , when i was a high school student , in order to pass entrance examination to a university , i used to tackle with numbers because i had to memorize years of the particular events happened in a history class without understanding ideas and concepts about why the particular event was caused as a result something preceeding events .
[non-native] from deferring a year before college or graduate school in order to travel and volunteer for social organisations to choosing to work with non profit organisations for their internships , young people are increasingly becomming aware of the ways in which they could help not only their communities but reach out to people across the borders and seas .
[native] first , that post was written specifically about the tpp , and i just copy pasted it for a person who had asked why it was secret , with the caveat at the top that it 's about the tpp ( specifically about us industry trade advisory committees at the end there ) .
[native] it really is a catch 22 for the germans but i feel only 3 countries have the capacity to take on a leadership role and of the 3 germany would be the best because it bridges a gap between west and east and is also the most economically powerful .
[native] reading comments about this here on / r/python and elsewhere , wow , absolutely shocking ... honestly if reddit is in any way representative of the culture in america , i feel extremely sorry for women who have to tolerate such insanity in real life .
[native] i 'm not disagreeing with you that the greek banks had other alternatives ( and we 'll never know how much more insolvent they would be if they 'd stayed open ) , i do n't find it very helpful in debate to dismiss stergthmmy 's argument on the basis of this kind of technical reasoning .
[native] the british forces initially seemed to have no bias , and the majority of catholics were happy to have them there , however this changed when the then prime minister of northern ireland brian faulkner ( an ulster unionist ) had the army brought under ruc control .
[native] my second attempt ( the one i photographed ) , used simple syrup for the bottom layer , everglades espresso and simple syrup at about a 70 / 30 mix for the middle layer , and vok blue curacao and vodka at a 40 / 60 ratio for the top .
[native] soft power is awesome and nobody wants to see conflict but the fact of the matter is that mankind has been fighting and killing each other since we first started walking this planet and recent events do not make me think this is going to change anytime soon if ever .
[non-native] so we have to own out our resposabilities and never give up in front of unforeseeable hindrances , instead we can change our outlook and we can share our sparetime with young people in order to focus togehter on the big opportunity we have to help our communities .students can learn facts , but not necessarily understand them .
[native] from wikipedia : si vis pacem , para bellum is a latin adage translated as , `` if you want peace , prepare for war '' ( usually interpreted as meaning peace through strength -- a strong society being less likely to be attacked by enemies ) .
[native] first , this guy in the video ( who 's probably not studied ir ) says that only in late 2012 did putin `` shift political strategies '' ( whatever that 's supposed to mean ) from `` economic growth to anti-western paranoia , conservative christian orthodoxy , and a russian imperial revival of nationalism '' .
[native] i do n't remember nato forces generating mass graves of civilians which they try to hide instead of publishing number of civilian deaths , parading pows and washing streets afterwards , performing mock executions and putting them online , denying ( keyword ) that they shot down a civilian airliner and then fabricating stories that the enemy did it , making ground incursions into nations and then denying that this is occurring , annexing territory of sovereign nations .
[native] but troika measures did n't focus on any of that , they focused on slashing pensions , increasing vat on essentials , fire-sale privatisations and later on in the game basically making greece dance to show `` who is boss , and let that be a lesson to the rest of you lefties '' .
[non-native] finally , i would say that students should understand concepts and ideas and learn facts becouse no one knows what will happen after days , years or century becouse life is progressinf and science is devolopingwith the recent rapid economic development , the pace of life is becoming faster and faster .
[non-native] she has also contributed so much to the society by building many santoriums and homes for the poor and old aged people .although there is alittle time for young people , because of the high amount of reponsiblities , works , and maybe we can say schools ( if they were not graduated ) any one can order his time and hime self to get the benefits by doing alot of thing in ashort time like studying , working , and helpeng their communitien or famillies , but with out ordering time the person will lose the ability of working well , the person will not have time that he can not do any more works .
[non-native] since he needs , at this time of period , the solid specific subject knowledge to prospell , even accelarate his reasearch in certanin academic field , rather than staying in the phase of exposing to a broad range of knowledge as much as possible .cars are an effective and convinient means of transport that can be owned by the individual person .
[native] one in which moving large numbers of troops , some possibly from another continent , with the heavy metal like mbt 's , ifv 's , artillery , food , fuel and ammunition for all of the above , getting them dug in and set up , does n't happen overnight .
[native] of course we have , every single person in the entire eu has , for decades , being calling for a world where the soviet union is super strong and america is put in its place because we really care that much about hating the evil empire etc.
[non-native] in this context context there can be numerous examples that can be stated among which i would like to state two which are as follows : firstly , in the case of a doctor , one can not go to a general physician for a heart problem .
[native] it is equally undeniable that the old regime was a hierarchical feudal serfdom with china improving quality of life considerably for them over the years with the area far more developed than neighboring nepal and also undeniable that china 's take over was based only on imperialist agenda with no heed of the democratic consent of the tibetans since .
[non-native] and finally travelling with a group of people it is a very fun thing to do , because you can get to know a lot of them , it always happens that may be in the group there is the lady that nobody can not stands because of her behavoir , or may be there is the weird couple with their freek kid .
[non-native] yes , with such a working style you are working on a wide range of subjects , and you are continuously changing your study topic , and you know some of everything , and you seem to be successful with a lot of work fields you have , but you lack one , and a very important thing : experience .
[non-native] most of the times as a parent it is vey difficult to explain to your younger children why a certain brand of cereal is liked by so many children on telivision and when you bring it home everybody runs away from it after first tatsing session .
[native] it 's absolutely reasonable to use this in some sort of political context , but you have to admit that it 's being overused to the point when rotherham is n't merely the city where the event occurred but `` rotherham '' itself is the event .
[native] not exactly true , your channel could be horribly insecure but you can simply encrypt the messages ( not that most people are remotely competent enough to not use crypto in a way that completely does n't work ) , and then constantly occupy the channel while not in use .
[non-native] for exmaple , if we look into our everyday lives , we can see that most millionares and billionares are the people who have actually tried something in thier lives and the people with normal wages are the people who are working for them .
[native] we 're having a big ukrainian-themed dinner tonight , just for fun ( and because it 's a good excuse to chow down on one of canada 's favourite foods : perogies ) , per the association between easter and ukrainian easter eggs ( yeah i know about faberge , but ukrainian eggs are [ kind of a big deal here in canada ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/vegreville_pysanka_august_2008.jpg ) .
[non-native] with people getting busier by the day and chances of buying a car increasing , and speed becoming such a vital thing , i believe that in the next twenty years cars will not only not decrease , but they will increase and the numbers of cars will sore .i agree with this statement for many resons .
[non-native] in moderen countrys such as japan they still use cara even they have new modren metroos and transption > aslo yung guyts like to putt it in accation mostly so they like to drive not driven or buy using some sort of new teghnalge that do n't have .
[native] i do n't understand politics at all , but my mum has been to a part of indonesia not far away from bandung ( i 'm not sure where ) and reports being warned not to talk to the police at all , me ( as a pre-school age child - i have a * vague * memory of this , actually , though i did n't know at the time ) finding drugs on the beach , and her being in a taxi that got pulled over and the driver arrested at gunpoint with more police pointing guns at my mum .
[non-native] the debate taking place about climate change and the convincing arguments scholars are giving us for the fact that , if we go on emissing such large ammounts of co2 , we are going to face a serious climate catastrophe , shows that we are forced to think of alternatives to the nowadays used cars .
[non-native] of course , when people get older , they have more and more responsabilities , and it becomes harder for them to free themselve , to spare time for their leisure if they are working , and , if they are retired , they probably do not wish to enjoy life in the same way as young people do .
[non-native] thus all these aspects not only require the support of the older population but must include the younger generation too since these young minds are considered to be tomorrow 's future in pure terms thus forming an example fr he future generations to come by influencing them by inculcating values like unity and culture and tradition of the community by leading to the better progress of the community thus i feel that today younger people must be encourged to spend atleast sometime with their community from their busy lives which is not only important for the moment but also for a better tomorrow and for a good and bright future of the community as well as the world thus making the world a better place to live in .yes , i definitely agree with this statement that young people nowadays dont give enough time to helping their communities .
[non-native] also , the energy supplies that are needed to run conventional automobiles are getting lesser everyday , unless a new energy source will be found , which will also have to be very cheap , driving a car will become much more expensive than today .
[native] of course most of these issues have died out and the last of the mongoloids have been shunned to the furthest recesses of civilization ( they exist but they mostly just exist as outlandish callers on radio shows and are honestly mostly harmless at this point ) but the issues that formed some of the violent and negative reputation the south got were mostly due to how the end of the us civil war was handled .
[non-native] to summarize , my opinion is that older people enjoy life more than young people , not only because of the oportunities that life present to them , but mainly because of the way they see life .it is true : youngsters do not care much about their communities or at least a fewer part of them do it with respect to elder generations .
[native] then explain why `` amd optimized '' games run better and on everything , and scale better , while `` nvidia optimized '' games have often generally poor optimization , which does n't get better over time , with some exclusive licensed crap added to it .
[non-native] my mainpoint is that it would be to much work to do when you want to have knowledge in all academic subjects , especially for me . ..there are a lot of people that think that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , but in my opinion it is better to specialize in one .
[native] under the un convention on refugees , if any of them get to italian , or spanish , or whatever soil and claim asylum , by ** law ** they are allowed to stay until their asylum claim is processed , so immediate deportation is both illegal , and immoral .
[native] so you 've paid back your 10 % bond back ( let 's say 10000 euro at 10 % - the interest is paid back periodically ) , but to pay back the principal you take a new loan ( 10000 euro at 3 % ) .
[native] that political crisis probably would have been very much larger had the uk also been in the eurozone , given the size of its own crisis and its often different outlook - theoretically , strong uk leadership could have made the political crisis less severe , but , eh , cameron , so no .
[native] they even attempted to claim a field used ( as in , in * current * use ) for cattle as their own because of some longstanding agreement they had apparently had with the field 's previous owner and began to dig foundations in the middle of it for a huge mansion .
[non-native] in conclusion , i guess it is really difficult sometimes to resist to the power of advertisements , but everybody should try to be a mature consumer , aware of the risks of not considering all the aspects related to our consumistic behaviour , as advertisement tries to make only money . .do people nowaday give enogh time to help their comunities ?
[native] > is someone using their typical we-no-idea-what-these-words-mean lingo like `` toxic '' ( thanks , riot ... ) , `` problematic '' , `` poisonous '' , `` misogynist '' , `` sexist '' , `` trigger '' ( sorry kiddies , you are n't ptsd sufferers ) or any of the other ones ?
[non-native] i did a professinal education as a media designer and now i am studying media sciences , political sciences and cultural sciences , and therefore i can tell from my own experience , that it is very important today , to have knowledge of a variety of topics .
[non-native] the both are hardly linked in my experience working only in an abstract way using combination of concepts to explain something would be , at first , very hard to understand because at the first concept you do n't understand you would be lost and furthermore you may not remember what you ' ve been listening for hours long .
[non-native] obviously , everyone should know when some important events ( such as the world wars , the american or french revolutions ) have happened but what we really have to care about is why they happened and what kind of consequences they have had for us .
[native] he may not be as big of a fucking clown as the guy in op , but it 's sadder because more people voted for him and he 's far more serious about it - when he bothers to show up in a suit .
[native] my visits to a dietitian are more about working through anxiety and identifying why i do n't eat when i should ( which leads to binging ) and identifying the little progresses i make so i do n't slide downhill back to bad habits .
[non-native] i believe this because advertising a product is n't usually about how good they are and what qualities it brings with it.a product needs to be sold and that 's why companies need to advertise in a positive way about it in order to sell the product .
[native] we have 10 + different german carts and [ our local best bratwurst ] ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/altengartz-portland ) is better than anything i had in germany since i first visited in 1992 , and i know it sounds gay but i fucking love a good sausage in my mouth .
[non-native] one of the papular movement called ` six sigma ' was thought to be a perfact solution of the future market , but it became a cause of less inovation of company because it based on a particular fact in the short time period and ignored lots of key concepts in business principles .
[native] i 'm in favor of banning an athlete whose nation has engaged in systemic doping and circumvention , since it 's very probable the athlete has benefited from this and has n't been caught yet , and furthermore , it 's important to discourage such actions on behalf of nations in the future .
[non-native] to sum up i want to ask a question ; living is risk by its own why to take more risks ?today , a growing number of people that led by a tour guide , when they have a travel to the other nation .
[non-native] see todyay if you are specialized in your field then you have a better chance of making to the top in this field and you cant earn a lot of fame and recognition in that field and you can also become a dr in that fields but incase of trying to know a lot of subjects would you might not be able to as good in either of the subjects .
[non-native] this is my experience but in conclusion i agree with this statemen : `` the best way to travel is travel that are accomplish with your motivations '' .i disagree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
[non-native] in the end peopel can change and young peopel also they just need some one to show them the way so they can help , like the teashers in school or advertysment in the different media like tv , news paper , radio , this will help them yo understand that their is other thing need them and that is not every thing for the money .in now day , many students learn things by memorize but not getting the main ideas .
[non-native] in fact , only few people having the experience about new things and risk can be possible to know the skill , like as `` how to do this dangerous position '' , `` how to manage some risk '' as `` the statistic of the management ability in the dangerous environment . ''
[non-native] though , there are a few advantages of a group travel , i prefer to travel alone as it offers the flexibility which is of foremost importance to me .in general it is better to have a broad knowledge of many subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
[non-native] and may be in future they might advertise it genunely ( the way it is ) , but as of now my option is that i agree that most of the advertisments make products seem much better than they really are .it is often better to have a wider perception of many academic subjects rather than confining oneself to a specialisation in a particular subject .
[non-native] i am a person who always keep a heart of curious , i want to know every thing around me , why the birds fly , why machines work , i ask and ask , my friends give the answers , i think they are mr.know-all .
[non-native] with proper motivation from the older generation this can be changed as was the case in my community when we in first moved to the community where i live now there was no proper waste disposal , people would just trow there waste in front of their neighbours house are on the roads which intern affected them with fly and mosqutioes .
[non-native] another reason , i support this statement is young people are full of sprits as they have not seen the hardships of life and they have the companion or a partner to enjoy with them , on the other hand , old people have seen many problems and they usually stay alone as their partner are not with them or their children are far away .
[non-native] i know that it wo n't be easy to reduce the number of cars , but i think it is a task to be done in order to keep the world a clean place and i am sure that it will be done !a community needs the help of every members to be a nice and pleasant place to live in .
[native] the uk would help if poland or the baltic states were attacked because it is firmly bound under no uncertain terms to do so , as would every single nato ally including the us , france , germany , canada , greece , norway , netherlands , spain , italy , czech republic , turkey , etc.
[non-native] it is possible to argue that in general , the pleasures of the young are more simple and pure as they tend to be carefree , with little responsibility , especially when compared to older people who probably have jobs to go to every morning and a family to support .
[non-native] if einstein had not paid specific attention to his specialization subject of physics , there would have been no development because all human creations of this date are based on his many thoeries like three laws of motion , theory of relativity , quantum physics etc .
[non-native] another reason for my favouring of learning facts as against understanding of ideas and concepts would be that by only learning ideas and concepts of any subject the student would not be successfull in his life or career because without any practical experience or going through with facts he can not able to show his talent or performance on the field or practise area .
[native] perhaps you 're forgetting the part where i specifically stated that i was fine with it since it would open up the debate about how we want democracy to function and would allow for the use of new technologies and ideas in the democratic process .
[non-native] because of all those benefits of travelling in a group led by a tour guide , i believe it is the best way for me to travel .everyone lives in a communty that consists of peoples , in which , all the people , old and young , are supposed to join the community activities , and to help their community in many of aspects .
[non-native] but not all the studies could be related with facts or we have facts with it , so ideas & concepts will be the major for those studies , in astronomy it 's hard to see everything about those away planets or stars from the earth but the ideas & concepts could work to explain things it 's maybe impossible to have facts about but it 'll not be as clear as facts but it 'll do the work .
[native] and you could also object that this is a `` group of people '' , but i 'd say ( although i hate to say it ) that everyone has to see how `` foreigners '' is a little bit more general , broader word than lgb .
[non-native] in my opinion the use of the car are more confortable that the use of pubblic transport , for istance , when i go to my university it is better for my to go with my car because i have a parking near my college , if i go with the bus or walking with my feet the time to arrive to my campus will be more than if i go with my car .
[non-native] you get to communicate with the local people , maybe try speaking a foreign language , find out what is considered a good food in the place and how to use the public transportation , and line up in the restaurant and eat , learning the `` local '' way of doing things .
[non-native] young people , for example go to pubs , disco , enjoy the night lifeof the city , can ride on a motorcycle through out the city while old people cant even imagine do that , they just sit at home and enjoy the tv .
[non-native] if one wants to live a better and more plentiful life , i find it basic to experiment , dare a little , risk it a bit and try new things .in this world there are many companies and productes , so there are orginal stuff .
[native] the problem with the current system is that it skips having that expressed in the voting record -- without that , people will * never * be comfortable with the prospect of throwing away votes , which third parties very much become in most electoral systems .
[non-native] second , the product will eventually work but most of the times not in the way shown in the adverstisment , lets take the case of a no-hair lost shampoo , the advertisment will show a bald man who wants his hair back , so he will use the shampoo for a few days and after minutes in the advertisment you will see a guy with long hair talking about his experience , i really do not beleive that , thats my personal opinion because they say you will se results in a short period , and yes , you will see them but not as much as they say it will .
[non-native] hence i would like to be diplomatic with the given statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doin what they already know how to do well .people need to move from place to place to carryout various daily activities .
[non-native] to conclude , i think to study board knowledge of many academics becaus of its useful facor to survive and helpful factor to study your own interest subject .i agree with the idea which more and more young people lose their interest toward community works or voluntary works .
[native] * however * , due to how recently yugoslavia broke up and everything that went down , i suppose i can see why people would prefer to not do anything that could flare tensions again ( especially if it were to become part of serbia rather than be independent ) .
[native] wind can produce massive amounts of energy and we should be investing in these much more than we are , onshore and offshore they 're great because if they 're built in a suitable environment once they 've paid themselves off then it 's free energy and it 's good for the environment .
[native] torrent link of dump : http://btdigg.org/search?info_hash=48490890253391c9c7b1592dfded633a62394373&amp;q=dzalba1.rar[13] it 's because of this leak that many western journalists were even able to interview former trolls , including one troll who brought along a man with giant nazi tattoos on his bare forearms to an interview with a new york times journalist , claiming he was her brother .
[native] i few years ago i realised i was trans and that i 'd been living my life just assuming i was a straight male ... once i realised i was making that assumption and let it go , everything just clicked into place and everything made sense !
[non-native] it is expected from a young person to earn good grades at school or at college , to participate in extra curricular activities to show a wide range of interest and many young people have to work after school to earn their spending money .
[native] the only way it would n't happen would be if all the eu leaders got mad butthurt and decided to put a dent in their gdp just to put a dent in ours as vengeance . . and i like to think that 's not what the eu is like .
[native] besides that , if you honestly believe that china takes amazing care of their environment and workers , rapidly burning through scarce resources is sustainable , and/or that artificially curtailing a generation wo n't create a disproportionate age bulge , you need your head examined .
[native] if a korean or nigerian told you that they wanted to preserve their own racial and cultural heritage , you probably would n't say anything to them , but if i as an irishman wants to do it , i 'm an evil nazi .
[non-native] the firs of them and may be the older one , inducts the knowledge , that mens some one have that knowledge and give it to others , that person is the master , the autority and almost superior , and their alumns follow him .
[non-native] but then you miss a chance . ..in my view the success depends on the area where he is working t. so , i belive `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already they know how to do well '' is true in some cases and it is not better in some other cases .
[non-native] i finally conclude that the present youth is not showing interest in such developing activities and there should be some programmes in order to create awareness which may be help the society itself develop to a higher level .there is in my country an common and old proverb that says : `` innovation is the mother of the success '' .
[native] i 'm not even going to delve into the depths of stupidity that go with the ideology of being an ancap to start with , because anyone with 1/8 a brain can see what happens when you remove virtually all state regulation and oversight over corporate powers .
[native] again , the explanations for those in the eurozone tend to be in terms of the euro , and the people offering those explanations tend to ignore the non-euro asset bubbles ( such as iceland and the uk ) in favour of a special euro explanation .
[native] then of course you have the opposite , which are the swiss with their planned , keynes-like viewpoint with a mixed public/private partnership where the government and local communities decide how much ( if any ) immigration they need through a combination of cantonal central planning and free market mobility .
[non-native] another technique that misleads the customers in an advertisement is to show people , and in some cases celebrities , using the product and having a great time , which gives the consumer the impression that buying the proct will make him feel happier .
[non-native] for instance , my cousin wanted to be an economist and before she decided which area she wanted to specialize on , her family members gathered and discussed what must be done eventhough my cousin specifically said that she really wanted to specialize in a certain field of economics .
[native] as far as i know there has n't actually been a british indian hindu or sikh terrorist nor has anyone from those communities ever even been arrested on suspicion , while their countrymen from islamic backgrounds are like half the terror suspects we see getting arrested in london .
[native] - the ruk government will make an announcement on friday morning that it will not enter into any currency union with iscotland but confirm to the bond markets that it will guarantee all existing debt and that it expects iscotland to pay its share , - iscotland will quickly give up any requests for a currency union ( as these requests will become embarrassing ) and confirm that it plans to set up a new currency , initally pegged to the pound , with a view to joining the euro as soon as possible .
[native] *** * furthermore , the us and the eu will include binding commitments to provide transparency , impartiality and due process with regard to licensing and qualification requirements and procedures , as well as to enhance the regulatory disciplines included in current us and eu ftas .
[non-native] in an idiom , it is stated that `` give me a fish and i eat it for a day , teach me how to fish and i eat it for all of my life '' . the main idea in this idiom is that even if we make everthing for our students available , this can not help them in their real life .
[non-native] in the past , for example my grandfather has told me , that they tought that in the year 2000 everything was going to change , machines were going to be able to controll everything , even us , cars were going to be able to fly . ..
[non-native] since these problems are geting more serious , the civil society , which may grow more in forthcoming decades in thailand , urges the thai government to restrict the number of cars in bangkok and the government has started to take actions as follows .
[native] the most famous one of course is when the ukrainian government claimed an su-25 airstrike that killed a lot of civilians ( no armed rebels ) was caused by the rebels launching a missile into an air conditioner despite it being caught on video .
[native] yes obviously cultures and societies evolve and change over time , but for that to be stable and not cause significant conflict and tension it has to be mostly by the consent of those within the society and evolve and change due to the people who live in it .
[non-native] help communities !now a days the publisity is the best way to promoved a produt and if you wanth to sale a product you should bring some information that makes , that the people who is seeing the advertisements make sure that the product very good and in the future this person could buy it .
[native] the usa [ is n't even a real democracy ] ( http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayabstract?frompage=online&amp;aid=9354310 ) , they 're always trailing on freedom indices , their government listens in on all their private communications , the have the second highest rate of incarceration in the world , they salute and pray to their flag every day before class ... and they still think they are the land of the free ?
[non-native] although these subjects are definetely related to each other and one might guess that there are a lot of connections which make it easier to advance in these ones than it would be with any different combination , it still is very demanding : working on both subjects has taken almost all of my time and thereby did not leave much room for leisure activities not related to university .
[native] now , you might disagree with the russian leadership on the truth of this belief that the us , the uk , and france would not retaliate with a nuclear strike , but having a rational strategy based on a flawed assumption and being insane are two totally different things .
[native] however , one point i 'd like to make is that two million protesters is nothing to sneeze at , and shows that there 's a lot of support for catalan independence , so there 's that if you want to call it an example of the legitimacy of the movement .
[native] while gridlock is a problem for presidential systems in general , in the case of moldova , where the political fragmentation is very significant due to geopolitical issues , a presidential system would allow the president certain room for maneuver that a parliamentary system would not .
[native] as one example , it 's actually saying that those jobs will likely shift due to ` pull factors ' ( meaning , people are enticed by a better wage ) , giving the example of european steel workers instead moving into the automotive industry .
[native] baidu tieba is even worse , with obvious spam ( illegal torrents of unrelated data , like popular movies or porn ) upvoted , extremely circlejerky opinions , constant name-calling , absolute non-seriousness ( 4chan-like , every single post is full of textspeak , 4-line-high emoticons ( built-in by baidu ! )
[non-native] this is because you would have to picture a world with no technological , no medicene advancment and a world void of what our society needs to prosper and become a better place .i would say , that society definitly need to have a broden academic knowledge as much as possible in different subjects .
[non-native] this assertion is on the bases of the reasons taht serious traffic jams , growing areas of car-prohibition and efficiency of public transportations .one must realize that the statement according to which there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today can be easily challenged or confirmed
[non-native] but i would clarify that it 's a problem for anybody who live in a community , not only for young people but also for adults .there are some people who like adventure , to figure out everything by themselves which gives ythem self confidence of being able to do something by themselves without needing anybody .
[non-native] brave people are not frighten of the events that may occur , and this approach in my opinion is the right one in order to lead the situations .during the education , the studies and even when deciding for a job , people are often put in front of an important question : is it better to get very deep into one specific subject or to keep a more broad mind .
[non-native] in fact it is possible that in future , not too far , there will be more efficace , more beautiful and user vehicles than cars .i have mixed feelings about the statement `` mostly advertisements make products seem much better than they really are '' .
[non-native] there are many reasons but they need alot of explination , both have their advantages and disagvantage but for me i agree on studying more than one academic subject and so this would make me feel safe and comfortable .is it more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts ?
[native] it 's also silly because it 's been recently found through genetics that most people in england are descended from the native brittonic celts and that the angles , saxons and jutes did n't actually unleash a mass genocide on the native celtic population as was once thought .
[native] classic country would be stuff like [ hank williams ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcigqwdwwag ) , [ merle haggard ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffhcglf0xdw ) , [ johnny cash ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exve40nng-m ) , [ marty robbins ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-y3db0wlh4 ) , [ loretta lynn ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9ehp7jjgq8 ) , etc.
[native] in relation to the `` non-binding '' nature of the vote , under the uk constitution the recognition of foreign states falls under the royal prerogative ( like the declaration of war ) which means that it is a power vested by convention in the crown , exercised by ministers .
[native] if the current plans continue with the idea to be able to operate both qe carriers with full complements of f-35bs , simultaneously , and still have a good reserve , it seems optimum to have an all f-35b fleet to handle attrition ( the retiring of older / worn out jets ) in the future .
[native] > what do you think is more likely , that both cps and the court system are wrong when looking at the facts presented to them , or that there is indeed a very good reason that the kid was taken away from the parents replace cps with police and norway with the us and you get an example of an organization that constantly gets a free pass from the courts ( and i think the reasons are similar ) .
[native] *** it 's not even that you asked a stupid question , it 's that once it got answered you just refused to accept the answer , which basically told everyone you were n't trying to ask a question at all , you were just trying to have another go at the ep for no reason .
[non-native] if i want to spend time with family members i would like to travel with my family members in a group and would like a tour guide to help us but if i want to explore and experiment with a new place i would prefer to travel alone so that i have independence and liberty to take my decisions and experiment .in japan , where i live , there are many travelers around famous places such as kyoto , fukuoka , and tokyo .
[native] they literally copied and pasted the nonsense daily mail article title , though they had the good sense to put ` hundreds ' in quotes because it was actually a couple dozen and the ` children ' they were targeting were moroccan teen gangs which are known to frequent the area and assault and harass others , and only a couple people actually got attacked before the police dispersed them .
[non-native] so maybe thinking in subjects like this it is hard getting success following the same steps others did long ago , beacuse of all the competition , maybe it would be easier thinking of a not so compited subject , so maybe here it is when you will have to try new things , explore new markets etc . .
[native] they created the united nations , instituted the marshall plan , helped japan write a democratic constitution , * they even allowed weak , devastated european powers to take their colonies back * they could have steamrolled over canada at any time ; but they never did .
[non-native] but for many reasons i said above , i hope the improvement of the transpotation system and i think it will be .it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject area because it it gives a broader view on life and the different aspects of it > having knowledge in many different areas allows an individual to understand how people think and why they think as they do > this is very important in life because it helps people get through life safely and soundly without much conflict > when an indicidual has achieved knowledge in several sectors of the academic spectrum he or she can view life and everything in life from many different angles and perspectives > having a broader knowledge can help you empathize with different people in different times and in different places > having a good knowledge of history for instance helps a person understand why certain events in history took place and why people thought the way they did duing those times > having a broad knowledge in math helps a person understand how the world is connected and how the flow of ideas works > understanding math allows a person to undertand the true value of things and the meaning of many questions and values > a great knowledge of philosophy allows a person to govern him or herself and learn vituosity and morality > now when all these areas are combined together < a person can view life from a numerical sense < a historical sence < and a metaphysical sense > this allows for better interpretations of events < problems and so forth in that could come up in life > if a person is only educated in one subject area < he or she will be confined and contricted to one way of thought and one way of understanding or analyzing situations and problems > when only one academic area is studied the learner will become a prisone of that area and will therefore be a close minded person > the world todqy is filled with close minded people < these are the people who are causing corruption and a potential threat to the word as a whole > this is why citizens of the world should fight illiteracy and work on manking evey mind an open mind in order to make this world a better place for everyone >no , i do n't agree with the best way to travel is in a group led .
[native] we do have the eurocorps , cjef ( not strictly an eu force , it 's just france and the uk ) , european maritime force , eu battlegroup and the eufor , but they are n't really standing militaries , and as always , would be subject to the whim of the more powerful countries involved .
[native] the report divides possible outcomes into three categories : in `` type 1 '' , such as sweden in the early 1990s , the level of output falls , never to regain its pre-crisis trend , but the growth rate recovers ; in the more damaging `` type 2 '' , as in japan since the 1990s , there is no absolute fall in output , but potential growth falls far short of the pre-crisis rate ; finally , in `` type 3 '' , as in the eurozone now and probably the us and uk , there is both a fall in output and a permanent fall in potential growth .
[native] the us has an advantage in subsidization because , first , it 's rather centralized compared to the eu ( witness the various kinds of fighters developed by the french , swedish , british which have similar roles ) , versus the us which as a single government can buy a single kind of plane for the one purpose instead of developing three different ones for three different state needs ) .
[native] there are three very bad cultural ideas that male and female child genital surgeries share : 1 . the human genitalia evolved incorrectly 2 . these natural genital deficiencies can be corrected with destructive genital surgery and 3 . parents have a right to perform destructive , non-therapeutic body modifications on their children .
[native] living in america , i 've reached the point where friends of mine start a sentence with `` so back in england ... oh ... uh ... yeah ... '' and kind of just fade into obscurity for a few minutes while they feel bad about forgetting where the person they 've lived with for the past two years is from .
[non-native] so enjoyment mainly depends on the person himself so if he / she someone who like to enjoy his life and has many interesting things to do in his / her life , nothing can prevent that to occurs even if the person was old .
[non-native] in conclusion , i understand that sometimes , especially for literary subjects , learning facts is necessary , but i strongly believe that this way of learning has to be accompanied by a deep understanding of the facts and of the links betweeen them .
[non-native] advertisement strategy is based usually on the following three pillars , making the packaging of the product agressive , by creating a new consumption trends that do not necessary correspond to the real needs of consumers , and by making the product looks the unique one adapt for the costumer needs .
[native] > ihs jane 's defence weekly described the nuclear-capable tu-22s to be based in crimea as * `` the backbone of soviet naval strike units during the cold war . '' * > rogers , the strategic forces subcommittee chairman , said sept. 18 that the russians have discussed * `` plans to station tactical nuclear weapons in crimea . '' *
[native] i 'm guessing it 's not a serious question and that you 're either a troll or an idiot , since you also seem to be in favour of cutting peoples hands off who steal and implementing sharia law and want everyone to wear a burqa as a common uniform .
[non-native] taking all these apects into account , i am strongly convinced that successful people who take risk are right .the question if it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts has been discussed already quite often .
[non-native] for example , if someone only likes learning about nature or animals and so decide to be teached only this subject , he will not be able to have a political discussion or an history discussion because he will have learned only one subject .
[non-native] for example , if we think of a shampoo advertisement , where a girl washes her hair with the promoted product and her hair suddenly starts to shine , we can definitely say that the products seems better than it really is , however such an advertisement is so common on the screens that it is no longer believable to most people .
[non-native] but for instance , in a history class you can understand the causes of the second world war except that if you have forgotten all the dates about the conflict nobody will follow you ; indeed the dates help the listener to understand what has happened and give him some hints to understand causes of the war in a global way .
[native] so while it may be easier for immigrants from outside the anglosphere to settle in these countries than it would be for someone outside the german-speaking world to settle in germany , i think the prospect of third-world immigrants fully assimilating/integrating into the predominant culture is probably no less difficult .
[non-native] in conclusion i think that everyone should take his or her own risks , maybe in what they do the best , in order to become successful considering that not any risk is worthy to takei believe that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know to do well .
[native] i had even heard about this island hospital , its commonly known there that this really horrible thing happens - what happens ? - ** they justify their use of disabled children - ( even children of favored members of the `` core '' songbun groups ! )
[non-native] at the end i just want to say that young people diserve more than that , and they are the future of our country , so we have to belive in them , and try to help them , and lead them to the right way , to countrol the country in the best way , and the country will rais up couse of them , so we have to trasit thes young people .i not agree with this statement .
[native] > as for ` why do you want to control people ' you 've got to be fucking kidding me , you 're arguing for forcing people to work unpaid jobs no one is forced to do anything , we established that is a lie .
[native] countries change their demographics for a whole host of reasons , a colonial past is one , ours initially was a need to increase the population after almost [ losing half the continent to the japanese ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brisbane_line ) , followed by it actually worked out really well for us , so we 've decided that we 're happy with multiculturalism .
[native] ( as an example , the us arguably has a sphere of influence in the carribean to counter cuba ) in this case , wars are extremely likely : major powers fight over these spheres , and members of these spheres , when trying to exit the influence of the dominant party , are brutally repressed by the major power ( cf.
[non-native] truly , all it would take for the young to grow into the old who can enjoy their lives would be the right mind to make right decisions so that they are successful in every endeavor that they go through .i agree with those who believe that more advertisements make products seem much better than they realy are for tha following reasons : the costomers are more sensible for the external aspect of the products , if the advertisement exalts some particular the product become more interesting and a funny music or presentation may involve the costomer to buy .
[native] however , a devil-may-care attitude certainly contributed to the spread , such as in cases where a sick indian working on a steam boat ( seems odd to even think of those technologies and peoples together ) spread the disease all the way up the missouri : > `` fulkerson requested of the steamboat captain that he put the first man to come down with smallpox off the boat .
[non-native] although many adult people that have already chosen what to study , think they are free from using alot of the knowledge they acquired at school once they decide wht they want to be profesionally , school was held for one reason ; making of each and everyone of us better people , people who are prepared to face life correctly and bravely .i am agree with the satement that specialised knowledge in one subject is better than goinf for many . ..
[native] but at the moment , the only moderator that 's active and actually dedicated to just one subreddit is / u/bezbojnicul , and this subreddit is too big for just him to be able to keep track of the problem users that consistently break rules , or to jump on these threads and warn people about the shit they spout before they say it .
[native] i 'd imagine there will be overrides because people might be concerned about this or other things initially , but i think manufacturers would have a hard time justifying them without mentioning that they are for emergencies - as that would be instructing users to break the law .
[native] in reality you 're just some rich fuckers cosily tucked away between two oceans and have never even faced an invasion , you guys love war and romanticize it because the closest you 've actually ever been to it was when you sat in the cinema to watch `` american sniper '' .
[non-native] conclude , i agree that it is better to know many subjects than to know one specific subject .i beleive that having abroad knowledge is agood idea , but after having that huge eruption in informations , could this be possible ; the answer is `` no '' , because the student will spend all his life trying to cover all the academic subject .
[non-native] more free time , more consciousness about time management and an amount of money that can easily spend on better opportunities of an enjoyable life rather than only survival would be good assets for a better taste in life .traffic is a big problem in great cities like istanbul , paris , new york .
[non-native] so finally , i would like to end this essay by saying that eventhough taking risks can sometimes turn out good for a person we should not think that we will be lucky enough to have such goos fortune and instead we should work on the things we know best inorder to succeed in this life .the various educational systems all over the world permit students to specialize more or less late .
[non-native] we can understand something better with facts , which means understanding ideas are better than known facts , like now developing country , we have a lot of competition with the others , and we have to have major skill to make a job , so we ca n't really think about the learning facters , because as i mention that internet does that job , so now we problem is how much we understant about it , not how much we know .
[native] now , you 're probably going to bitch and whine about the un convention on refugees and how it should n't have been ratified , but the point is that * it has * and hence it 's pointless to talk any more about the subject .
[native] as to the rest , there 's eyewitness accounts from czech pilots in french squadrons where after getting reports of incoming german aircraft , the frenchmen would just continue eating dinner instead of scrambling to attack them , which the eyewitness attributes to their exhaustion from the first world war .
[non-native] as the all the above indicates , both of the very different two solutions have their own superior and perior as well , so in my opion i would prefer to stand the neutral side ; try to conbimnate with those two ideas , as it is better for students in case of being too stereotype , or abnormal .
[native] the logic in deciding they were n't actually slaves does n't hold up well , he uses quite illegitimate terms to divide slaves from `` servants '' as he called them , regarding them all as prisoners of war is also absurd , they may have had more rights than the african slaves but they were certainly subjected to indefinite involuntary labour whatever way you turn it .
[native] i think the point here is it was not just a motherboard ( which would make the damage even more unacceptable ) , but the issue that they basically destroyed an entire computer because they could n't be bothered doing a more careful examination .
[non-native] by the way , my parents enjoyed our trip and think it is one of the greatest they ever had .if we happen to consider this issue from an academical point of view , it seems plausible to exemplify it in a classroom environment .
[native] the us is enormous and mostly has fantastic living standards , but we have a portion of the country - large enough to matter on a societal/image level , but not large enough to affect our rankings in hdi and such - in extreme poverty that unfortunately nobody powerful seems to be willing to do anything substantial about .
[native] i really must check out their first 2 albums , which predate this album by about a decade but apparently do n't feature the vocals so much , which would be a shame because i love the sounds they manage to make with their vocals .
[non-native] in my community all the children get together every friday and make sure that the society is kept clean and ensure that all the facilities are operational and the elder children also teach the younger children various sports and help them with thier school work .
[non-native] unless they make more and more cars battery operated and somehow manage to miraculously bring down the amount of congestion on roads to which even today most of the cosmopolitan cities are victim be it london , new york , taipei , beijing or mumbai .i agree with the statement that said `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
[native] `` the f/a -18 is a huge brick mobile phone , but the f-35 is like the latest iphone . '' `` we 're going to have to adapt the way we think about air combat to be able to utilise the f-35 to its full potential , '' -- air vice - marshal kym osley
[non-native] even though it will be much more convenient to depend on the tour guide and follow wherever the tour guide may lead as a group , the essence of travel which sprout from experiencing the sense of adventure , as well as the sense of being an explorer while we travel can not be obtained if we had a tour guide and traveled as a group .
[non-native] to conclude i thing that to decrease the number of cars in the world , we have to improve common transportations and their access because today too much people do not have the possibility to take it .the use of cars in our modern societies is a crucial point which we 'll have to deal with in the coming years .
[native] so when people tell me that the eu always had this plan to rip apart ukraine and share it with russia and that they 're equally to blame for this whole mess and that they 're just as imperialist as russia but they 're just much more sneaky about it , i do n't know what the fuck they 're talking about .
[native] most of the reasons that the city is turning on the eu is because it is enacting legislation designed to curb unpopular banking practices , while the uk has done nothing of the sort because the city is far , far too important to it .
[native] similarly , just as the children of devout catholic , protestant , buddhist , hindu and other immigrants , i 've watched a number of children of muslim immigrants , despite being raised in the faith , simply drift away from it when they reached adulthood in a free secular society .
[non-native] to conclude , i will say that the different ways to promote a product and the problems they each carry show how the topic is too general to be a true statement .in japan , where i live , many people agree with the idea that cars will reduce in several decades .
[non-native] concluding , it is not the advertisement that makes product look better but it our way of thinking that prevents us from seeing the true reasons why advertised products are better than owned products .i do not agree most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are .
[native] > i support it , however , there is n't any popular support for this do you think the more worried newer eastern block members of the eu will push for it , maybe create or finance some internal propaganda to drum up western support and in a non malicious way , try and subvert western opinion towards supporting it ?
[native] it 's not that i * want * to talk about it , it 's that i think it should be allowed as a topic , instead of suppressed by guys who 'd prefer to think of women as perfect , clean , unyucky sex objects .
[native] nothing in the article linked supports the case that you make , beyond the headline , and given the numerous times the bbc has been accused of bias on the issue , i 'm going to need something considerably more substantive than just a headline unbacked by any quotes .
[non-native] in this case the most of the time the films whose trailers i watched seem wonderful and i often decide to go and see them ; but when i am in the cinema i understand that the trailer , during its sixty seconds , presents to me a collage of the best scenes of the film , but the other dozens of scenes are bad !
[native] the best thing we can do is raise awareness until the electorate are bombarding their mps with questions about how they 're going to tackle the issues of ageing population and demographic disaster , then they 'll be a queue of parties ready to tackle it head on .
[non-native] the statement , that simple factlearning will nececary lead to failtue is not 100 % true , but it contains a important message and should be used as a motivator , especially in certain fields of study .i do not agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
[native] so they have a much more loose definition of what it means to be american or canadian culturally speaking '' ... and while it is obviously true that canada/australia are much younger countries than those of europe , and lack a strong ethnic nationalism , i think the belief that `` anyone can integrate '' is rather overstated , particularly among people who have never lived here .
[native] republicans on the other hand tend to have a very large support base in the older generation , who will take every single opportunity to vote that they can and they do n't care about the actual person running just what party they belong too .
[native] i suppose the point i am trying to make is that my own viewpoint on this is that the failure of the ussr to implement communism ( by becoming a degenerated workers state ) ( and the hostility of the powerful countries to the left ) had a tremendous impact on the socialist movements to the extent that i 'd say it would be difficult to attribute the failure to implement communism only to the failure of the ideology itself .
[non-native] the government is working on such issues and by the end of twenty years would have excellent transportation system like public buses , trains , trams and metros which can take the person to his destination in much less time than the individual cars .
[non-native] therefore it is not only the fault of the young people that they do not taking some time to spend with their community , it is as well a problem of communication due to the fact that only adults could communicate from their own experience , it is their responsibility to take action .
[non-native] but know he knows how to recognize this signal , because he had broad his knowledge .some people says that it is more important for student to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts , on the other hand someone says that for a student is more important to learn facts and not to understand ideas and concept .
[non-native] on the other hand , being epecialized in only one subject and forget about knowing a little from and a little from therer might make someone ignorant when he or she is exposed to situationms where he or she is required to make a response to a general knowledge stimulus .
[native] we all know that the war was wrong , war always is ( but sometimes it is the lesser of two evils ) and is never to be celebrated , but failing to remember those who died only cheapens their sacrifice and , but extension , the sacrifice of every soldier before and since .
[non-native] in this point of view , such people who has not much ability but has the only chance to be rich easier , for instance to gamble their whole money or find a way of making legal money by business , may take risks rather than doing what they already know how to do well .
[non-native] those tw exemples support the reason of agreement with this statement .successfulness , creativity and adventuring are strongly related terms that constitue the personality of an ambitious , dynamic and self motivated person , they are the moving force behind persons determination to succeed , on the other hand , sticking to the traditions and doing routine things will lead to suppression of persons opprtunities to be improved .
[native] sure , you can call it a `` side business '' ( whatever definition you come up with to suit your narrative ) , but that wo n't change the reality that they , in fact , are in the advertising business and by their own words they do compete with google in that space .
[native] it 's really quite hard to generalise about the uk because while of course while a pint of milk will cost basically the same across the uk , housing and transport costs are such a big part of expenditure here and they vary to an insane degree by region .
[non-native] today big cities have diffuculties on solving traffic problem , besides ; another solution is that , in order to solve this problem the machines that will be used to transport people will have more seats in it so that , it would transport as much as people that it can .
[non-native] i see that there is something wrong because if i study very much for the exam and i barely remember a concept , two weeks before i ca n't remember that concept because i do n't undertand it or because i have n't a fact that can conduce me to remember the concept .
[native] > i would argue that if not the fact communist poland was basically robbed and stopped from developing by soviet union , the communism itself would n't be so crippling , as you can see today its not like the former [ ussr itself was doing so well ] ( https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&amp;idim=country:pol:rus:ukr&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:pol:rus:ukr&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ) .
[native] indeed i did n't use it for about 12 years after being able to drop it as a subject in school , and it is only in the last few years i started to use and re-teach myself it after having the drive/desire/need to use it .
[native] http://cphpost.dk/news/denmark-is-one-of-the-nsas-9-eyes.7611.html > denmark is one of the nsa 's ' 9-eyes ' > denmark has a closer relationship with the us intelligence agency than sweden and germany -- to the concern of danes and the annoyance of germans sorry , you were saying something about western liberal democratic traditions ?
[native] > to new zealand , australia , and canada , indeed to the whole empire , it is intolerable that an unscrupulous and aggressive power , like prussianised germany , should be permitted to establish and possess naval bases in distant and foreign oceans .
[non-native] furthermore some tecnical devices are used to create the sensation of wealth in the consumer , for instance using the image of a creamy yoghurt , surrounded by fresh fruits and pieces of chocolate , even if , in the reality - practically making the commercials - the yoghurt is just a white-coloured cream , so creamy that it 's impossible to recreate into reality .
[native] some states that raise it over time add a little every year to keep from significant changes , like massachusetts is raising it a little every year until 2017 and then it will be $ 11 an hour , or california raising it to $ 13 an hour in 2017 .
[non-native] as a conclusion i can repeat that i am and i aplly this statement in my personnal life because it opens more doors and enhanse your life with various informations , but if someone hasnt the ability to conduct this way of life it would be better for him to specialise in one subject so he could be good at it because in this case it is better to be good in one subject than be bad in all of the others subjects because we dont have the time or the ability to succed .environmental issues and sustainable development are and become more and more fashion everyday .
[non-native] they told me that , as they are working hard every day and have to face a lot of problems at work , they do not see the point in helping someone who is not trying , as they do , to work hard and improve their life .
[non-native] i think that this is the right way to learn , because for having a good career , you need to be very prepared in your own subject , but it is also quite important to show that you have also a general culture of other subjects .
[native] have you considered that maybe the reason companies like hiring politicians , is because those politicians are experts on the matters they 're being hired to do , understand the political process , and know a lot of senior figures in the area , and not as a result of past favours given in office ?
[native] so when you advocate scotland seceding , but poo-poo the shetlands counter-seceding to remain int he uk , you sound like a bunch of slaveowning racist pricks in 1861 who are looking out for number one rather than actually caring about your `` rights '' .

[native] ideally , people who want to should be able to own guns , and then not go off and go on a killing spree , and people who do n't want to own guns do n't own guns and do n't need to fear for their lives .
[native] most of the changes they 'd have to make to qualify for membership would benefit the population , not all , i 'm aware the eu is not a workers paradise by any means but ukraine has a very low wage rate even compared to other former soviet countries .
[native] the way i see it , it 's just an entirely unnecessary process that 's done entirely for the interests of some corporation that does n't have * our * interests ( the most important interest ) at heart and it ultimately does n't pay off .
[non-native] in mostly long history , the sussessful people tried to do new things even though it was so dangerous even they suffered death risks three historical people are typical chrateristics to try new thing and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
[native] this is also the region with maliki as the predominate school where apostasy is seen as a crime punishable by death , blasphemy is punishable by death , stoning is the punishment for `` illegal '' sex and for being homosexual , and where women need permission to marry .
[non-native] thus , i think that the good way to travel is in agroup led by a tour guide because they now better places and i might meet new people .i disagree with the following statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because our world is packed with information to learn and to understand .
[native] i do n't know exactly what the process of election by the various parties you 've listed entails , but having the judiciary selected by other branches of the government is fairly normal , and does not automatically disqualify the judiciary from being independent .
[non-native] let me tell you about my self am a risk taker and am definitly supproting people who take risks in there life why , because taking risk is one of the main reasons why people successed in there life but there are limits for taking risks .
[native] > it 's also generally hilariously america-centric ( not a slight on the yanks as a whole but it 's just because it mostly seems to be yanks using the term against other yanks and then applying the specific american context to the whole wide world ) .
[native] maybe not as good as the bbc for calling itself out on its own bullshit from time to time , but i consider it a trustworthy news source when it comes to national affairs ( it tends to `` dumb down '' or not explain properly international news a bit ) .
[native] we 're allowed to be introspective there 's nothing wrong with not remembering your enemies or allies ( again i should point out that commonwealth soldiers from around the world are also remembered as part of the british dead with those men from the british isles themselves ) at every event .
[non-native] probably this is due to the lack of human relationships that emerge from spending time with videogames , so i think that if they start spending their time in helping their community they will both use their time in a better way and be happier .
[native] our energy production is slated to increase quite a bit over the coming decades because we have quite a few accessible shale formations and our property laws make land ownership fairly simple to manage , so yeah we could easily start a fund soon-ish ( whenever production ramps up and our economy is at full steam again ) .
[native] you speak norwegian , and your colleague speaks italian . . does n't mean you can talk to each other in those languages , or work on a document together in those languages , you still need a shared language , and by far the most common one is english .
[native] you can argue that the eu is n't doing as much as it should and that it is too little too late , but i think you 're being disingenuous by saying that the eu `` threw ukraine under a bus '' they are at least trying to solve the problem , even though they 're shit at it .
[native] if streaming sites are placing an excessive strain on isps ' resources , much more than other content providers , and if their particular business ( off of which they profit considerably ) is placing considerable costs on the network that would not exist if their sites were not utilising it , i would at least listen to a proposal to put an extra charge , fee , tax , whatever you want to call it on these types of businesses .
[native] within the eu , the v4 would consist of 64 million europeans , a block of significant weight and could offer a substantive counter to germany and france within the eu since the uk wants to escape from its responsibilities and italy/spain are incapable .
[native] `` one woman , who said she was sexually assaulted as a 13-year-old in 2003 by a group of ** asian ** men '' - sageer hussain - mohammed whied - ishtiaq khaliq - waleed ali - asif ali - masoued malik - basharat hussain - naeem rafiq they all sound muslim to me .
[non-native] for example , if a student with business major only learned facts about , say , germany , and not the concept that stands behind those facts , he might never be able to fully understand them , or to see that facts he learned about brazil can be compared to them .
[non-native] what i mean that we can help these people by persuading people to help the , why do n't we make a special day in the year that all people an the world in this day will support the by anything , money , food blankets , anything , even used books , anything we might not find it useful for us maybe it will be usefull for them .while we live in the current world , it is nesseary to get the better social position .
[native] there are many countries in the world that are n't signatories to the echr that to respect those values ( new zealand ... ) and there are countries that are signatories to the echr that do n't respect those values ( like russia ) .
[non-native] he thought lot but suddenly he got an idea to drive cycle with scating shoes then he brought the rope and he tied it to the handle with balancing the cycle he use to drive the cycle , then slowly he developed by riding on bikes he is now succesfull in that .
[native] but we seem to get this bizarre image from german greens ( and sorry for using you as a focus seeing as your flair is german , but i do n't mean you specifically ) where they want to remove funding from iter , the most advanced fusion of science and engineering on the planet and the best shot we have at fusion power ( let alone the other research applications ) .
[non-native] petrol companies like chevron and governments ' scientits are searching new ways to give power to cars engine , for example using hydrogen or converting sunlight in power , now this kind of energies cost a lot , but in some years they will be the most used way to give power not only to cars .
[native] honestly if you 're trying to argue that it makes sense to have lots of buttons with no labels and no hover tips , and no known function until you actually click the button and see what happens ... you will never convince me that is somehow good design .
[non-native] i think that also the character of a person is very important , some people are jovial and carefree and if they keep those traits as they get older they will be able to enjoy life as much as they did when they were younger .
[native] this spending is mandated , which is to say it grows by a set of rules rather than the will of congress ( though of course , if congress had sufficient will , it could change the rules and cut back the spending . )
[native] if anyone is wondering why a news website from the other side of the planet has decided to post an article talking about anti-immigrant sentiment specifically in sweden ( though yes , sweden 's election is right now ) , without mentioning it is a europe-wide issue .
[non-native] finally , the development of the alternative means of transportations like improved buse service , better network of trains , etc can again lead to a reduction in the number of cars purchased by people and contribute to a reduction of the total number of cars in times to come .
[native] france 's economy is legitimately struggling , while it might be able to take hits from giving up on this arms deal , especially if they 're compensated , the overall damage to their industry would be far greater than the costs of some mistral ships .
[non-native] we would still be living in caves and using stones to light a fire if there had n't been someone who specialized in the subject of how to light a fire without first searching for firestones , and then hoping for good luck to make the firestones work properly to finally cook a meal .
[non-native] the first time i visited italy and learned about its artists , its culture , music and history i fell in love with it , the first time i got to interact with its people i was certain i would come back one day and live the rest of my life there , in italy , in rome . ..
[native] just as the waves of privatization which swept eastern europe after the fall of communism served to vastly enrich oligarchs in many countries who were closely associated with organized crime , so the oligarchy in the western nations hopes to be enriched by this new wave of irreversible privatization based on the [ most extreme parts ] ( http://www.wto.org/english/res_e/booksp_e/analytic_index_e/gats_03_e.htm#comm ) of wto-gats .
[native] with mine you can just see that i went straight to visit berlin , munich , auschwitz and amsterdam , [ edit : and gothenburg , ] which are n't really known for being representative of their countries ( no capital city is ) .
[native] typically with perpetual bonds the issuer has an option ( i ) either to redeem after a certain amount of time has passed or certain trigger events have happened , and in this case the issuer has to repay the bonds ( ii ) or to continue to pay interest ( which is at a low level ) for eternity .
[non-native] net , etc. but he has learnt only the basics or in other words we can say that he had not practice or given attention to one particular langauge , then he/she is going to face lot of problems in a software development of one langauge .
[non-native] finally , the implications in the passage would state clearly that , it is not important for a person to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , but its really very good for a person to gain profieciency in one particular subject that helps him inbuilding his career and do better in his job , in all required aspects .
[native] eh , no the target for the actual crisis is 2017 ( i know i sound crazy , but to sum it up i believe a global sovereign debt crisis caused the great depression in the early 20th century , and it is glaringly obvious from my perspective that we are on the brink of another one ) .
[native] you have to take things into account , such as the population * outside of london * as many external analyses of the riots are far too london centric and the per cent of the population which is naturally of a particular ethnic group .
[non-native] all together for me it is proven that ideas you understood ones will help you your whole live in different situations , let it be in lessure time or in business , but facts you learned by heart , will be forgotten as soon as the test has been written .products that a company make must look in front of the customer unique and useful through advetisements .
[native] everything but the act itself is illegal ( i think ) : > the activities related to sex work that are prohibited by law include operating a premises ( sexual services establishment or brothel ) where such activities take place , being found in such an establishment , procuring for such purposes , and communicating such services ( soliciting ) in a public place , making it difficult to engage in prostitution without breaking any law .
[native] my grandfather was in a troop ship that was torpedoed by a u-boat , was at d-day & was wounded at the battle of hürtgen forest , but that does n't give me liberty to act like i know what the fuck he 's been through or that i can empathize with what he 's been through .
[non-native] there were 2 people both travelling from point a to point b at the same time , one by private car and the other one taking the public transportation , and not surprisingly the result showed that the second man got point b earlier because there are too many cars on our streeet nowadays .
[non-native] in my point of view , advertisements really works well for those who make the business , it motivates cunsumer to purchase on their items , but if we take a close look at some commercials on the tv , their always presenting you the positive side of their products , instead of the things that have left behind , for example , we often see some shampoo commercials on tv , using those ladys with long hair showing you that if you use this brand of shampoo you will have the same shining hair as the lady have on the commercials .
[native] and lastly , there are a-lot more ` gate way ' countries in south-east asia between australia and where the refugees/economic migrants are coming from , none of our immediate neighbours are source countries , instead they are coming from as far away as sri lanka and myanmar .
[non-native] if governaments choose to enlarge public spending supporting the constructions of trains , subways , and all the other `` public '' means of transport , people will be offered an alternative to the car , but if governaments miss this point , cars will still be used as a preferential way to move from one place to another .
[native] ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2fjgyv/with_headquarters_in_poland_the_united_kingdom/ck9ytll ) i 'm not some biased anti-western idiot who ignores reality and runs around claiming that poland could have been saved , i am a historian first and foremost and i would n't be arguing this point if it was n't something i have n't gone into depth studying .
[non-native] from the reasons above , i believe specialized knowledge in one specific subject is better than broad knowledge of many academic subjects .i 'm agree with the statement above , because usually the companies want to have more costumers and they start the publicity for this .
[native] even if there was only one rape a year , that person still has the right to try and defend themselves in a means proportionate to their attacker - for someone smaller and weaker , this means some sort of a weapon is necessary .
[native] in fact , it goes so far to me as to be oppressive to people with gender identity issues because if you are a boy who likes girls ' toys , it is n't something you can discover on your own and be accepted for , but a unique identity that 's being whitewashed because you 're no longer `` unique '' ... and that 's where confusion sets in , because sexuality and gender are n't black and white except for the physical aspects of it and people who are different do deserve to be recognised as such .
[non-native] if you want to try new things you need first a very good imagination and find the way to apply that , is like an inventor , sometimes the inventor can failt in the invention or in the discoveries but never give up , in contrast , he tries not just one time , a lot of times , until he has the thing that he wanted .
[non-native] why should i spend my time visiting places i am not interested in or discussing my preferences with persons i know will not share them ?advertising seems to has became a business technique for introducing products , especially in over exagerated way , to gain the public 's attenetion .
[non-native] of course at the beginning , the process to explore new things is difficult and long , sometimes you have to try with a lot of things and spend so much time before find what really do you want to do or your vocation .
[native] so i would think it is mostly correlation unless there is some defining characteristic that makes someone and their corresponding values absolutely christian in 2014 and would have similar values at any other point in christianity 's timeline and would stand out from others as well anywhere else on the planet .
[non-native] drive their cas , go to mountins , in the mountins , they sing a song in a big volume , it dose not mattter , it 's funny , no one will say : `` hey , guy be quite ! ''i agree with this statement because the car 's industry it 's in full expensin .
[native] the debt is still 180 % of gdp ... you have : debt / gdp and the denominator is constantly shrinking previous discounts do not matter , the only question that matters is * `` can the loans be repaid at current debt levels '' * , to which the resounding answer is no .
[native] for us on the other hand , it 's more important to address those broader societal ones , but that would require an aggressive european foreign policy and that 's something we do n't have nor is it something we will have any time soon .
[non-native] i believe that people who is willing to challenge new things without worrying too much of taking some risks tend to be succesful because they tend to have positive attitude toward everything in their live that they are dealing with , while people who tend to stick to one thing that they are doing fine tend to be stable financially but never be successful .`` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . ''
[native] and still other water companies find themselves in the position of having to maintain 100 + year old , leaking and insufficiently capacious infrastructure that has been neglected for far longer than the company 's existence and would cost tens of billions to renew .
[native] if someone is stupid enough to believe in a magical sky-fairy and to take their moral direction from people who lived thousands of years ago and could n't even read , regardless of which bullshit religion it is , you can bet your ass i 'm going to judge them for it , * especially * when it is strongly correlated with barbaric behaviour .
[non-native] first of all and that 's in my opinion the main reason why i think that in twenty years there will be more cars than there are today , is that most of the people get richer , so they earn more money and they want to have a good reputation and to look great , that 's why most rich people want to have the newest and best looking cars at the moment .
[native] the margins were far ~ ~ smaller ~ ~ larger than anyone expected , but you 're right , turnout was a major factor in labour 's near miss in h&m . ( not the store ) one thing you said stood out to me though .
[non-native] he could be the best in his field , he might have won countless prizes on his theories about quantum computers , but he might look like a complete fool when the conversation is about the ideas brought on by franz kafka in his book `` metamorphosis '' .
[native] there has been some really interesting research with re-training stroke victims who have damaged their motor control region on how to walk again ; instead of just trying to get them to walk ( which causes the brain to try and activate the damaged regions ) they start them from a crawl so the brain has to start from scratch forming new pathways .
[non-native] the purpose of advertisement is to express one or more ideas related to the product that is advertised in order to increase the appreciation of the product and therefore to convince to buy it or eventually just to agree with the message the advertismement wants to communicate .
[non-native] another important advantage of understanding the ideas behind a certain fact is that you can easily find a perfect solution for problems that are based on the same ideas in notably shorter time and that you do not have to learn every scenario by heart , because you can derive it from a `` basic '' scenario .
[native] > if that is correct , i do n't see how this can be a good decision the way it sounds to me is that the current anti-corruption agency has in the past been 100 % ineffective , so a major change in operation is called for .
[native] i love all the quips of `` most people wo n't understand the implications of the question '' , as if somehow its ` obvious ' that people should n't have a say in the future of their country ... far better to let institutions who are shamelessly more interested in western european banks tell greeks the correct action to take .
[native] the competences of the eu are therefore a patchwork , with a couple of big solid areas like the single market , and a whole host of bits and pieces like pet passports and sports promotion - because those are the areas the member states consider as more effectively handled through the joint framework .
[native] the uk will have to decide which would leave them off better economically , negotiating free trade agreements with the anglo world at the possible expense of the best exit negotiations with the eu or waiting for fta talks with other countries until after exit from the eu is complete .
[native] not only i 've never said anything along the lines of instant gratification and using something as a tool being mutually exclusive , but `` using a smartphone to look up information or research something '' and `` instant gratification '' are completely different terms .
[non-native] one particular example is about the whitening chewing gums that usually come on t.v. being a dental student i know that any particular individual 's tooth colour is mostly predetermined and that the whiteness can not increase if that particular colour is that individual 's tooth colour .
[non-native] actually , i agree , however , i do not think that in the next twenty years , people are going to get rid of cars , i mean there would be no fewer cars , but on the contrary there would be more cars to use , and the streets are going to be too crowded .
[native] is it not time for green parties across the globe to drop ( what is in my opinion ) their simplistic opposition to fusion power research , and nuclear research in general , given some of the promise shown in 4g nuclear reactors proposals and beyond ?
[non-native] on the other hand , given that most people do what they already know how to do well , it is hard for them to succeed in doing so , since they have to compete with so many other people for recognition and success .
[native] the place was pure white , really cold with the very loud noise of cooling systems combined with hundreds of hdds in sans all spinning simultaneously ... there were really tough looking guys in `` do n't fuck around '' uniforms standing around everywhere .
[non-native] let 's talk about arts and music , how can we say '' this is the fact '' these hobbies can not be considered as undeniable because there is no answer for a question of art such as '' is it beautiful ? '' i could say yes and my brother no .
[non-native] if young people means child , the statement will be kind of true , what i 'd like to say is that when your a child you will defenitely enjoy the life more than older people do because you 're still sort of unconscious yet and without any kind of worries besides ' what am i getting for christmas ? ' and so on . ..
[native] the us is equipped to fight a war that might not happen for 20 or 30 years , but they will have the last laugh when it come to fighting for that last barrel of oil , kilo of phosphorus or drop of clean water .
[native] it 's bizarre to me that people think the interaction goes like this : ** immigration officer ** : we 've deemed you 're not a refugee , so now you have to tell us where you 're from so we can deport you !
[non-native] i think that in twenty years many people will have got rid of their cars and will not look after petrol alternatives but after car alternatives ( public traffic ) like busses , trams or trains .nowadays life is tough and expensive and young people have a lot of responsibilies in their life .
[native] us officials routinely play down the likelihood of companies actually bringing isds-based lawsuits - or winning substantial damages if they do - while commission officials stress the advantages a ttip deal could offer to european businesses , whose lobbies have pressed hard for it .
[native] it 's rather hard to say when we stopped completely thinking of ourselves as british , it started with ww1 ( our soldiers saw they had a different culture ) , and after ww2 ( where the empire could n't defend against japanese aggression ) we really began to start thinking that we were australian and not citizens of the empire .
[non-native] people now a days were aslo partisprating in many events which were relating to social and economics factors , mainly in social activities like helping the poor and old people in homeges and giving lot of support to these people who were in need .
[non-native] people who lived a lot of things - which can be consired as ` taste ' in life - learn how to defend and stand for bad happenings and it must help them to be happy even if they are in very bed situations .
[native] i think the likelihood of that statement being true in any population is around 0 % > * `` so that 's the reason why 84 % of muslims in egypt and 86 % in jordan is for death penalty for people who leave the religion ?
[non-native] fisrt everything comes first right in to the human eye , what looks atractive , new and original is always an eye catcher , and this has been proved , even i am a victim of those atractive things , is something comun and usual to find .
[non-native] i do agree that some advertisements may actually see much better than they really are , but considering the issues like they educate people , they help in making decisions and save time , i think that the advertisements are of great help to the society .
[native] display is most likely going to be cheap , the storage capacity is laughable , fingerprint reader is a nice gimmick , but nothing expensive either , the battery is n't `` huge '' , it 's 25 % larger than the `` normal '' ~ 3k battery .
[non-native] a guide and a group come to provide experiences , poins of view , cultural knowledge that when put together create a cultural diversity which comes to transalte into a remarkable trip .nowedays , competition between companies is feirce , every one needs do his best in order to sell his product and survive in the market .
[native] basically we want to unite ireland ( not in the way they want to be reunited of course , but at least law and order will be restored to the rebellious fenians ) , sell scotland to our banker friends and turn wales into a massive power plant using the tears of orphans for hydroelectric power to fuel our private helicopters .
[native] anyway , i 'll admit that broadly you have a point , turnout is low and is part of a trend downwards , but i disagree with how severe the implications of the ep 's turnout is , and how significant the downwards trend is leading me further to question whether anything significant can be drawn from this `` lack of public support '' given that the trend for downwards support is n't very significant and turnout itself is n't much lower than in a lot of national elections and about in line with most other second order elections .
[native] on the north yasinovataya is still under control of separatists , on the east -- basically everything , khartzysk , shakhtarsk , etc. , on the south-east -- ilovaysk ( there was a notoriously unsuccessful attack on it yesterday by `` donbass '' , `` azov '' , `` shakhtarsk '' battalions ) .
[non-native] all most all of the universities throughout the world offering specialisations like journalism , enginieering , medicine things like that suppose if we take medicine field it includes specialisations like dermatology , psychiatry , cardialogy , neurology , pulminology etc ... , if we take engineering field it includes specialisations includes electronics , mechanical , chemical , computer science and civil .
[non-native] obviously the modification they do on the product is intended to make it look better , so that you are willing to buy it .for the discussion of the question whether young people give appropriate time for helping their communities some definitions have to be pointed out in the first place .
[non-native] in this fast moving world there are many things to enjoy the life so that these young people are freshers to the world which have not yet started to see the nature 's beauty etc. so that they roam here and there with their parents or relatives or friends and enjoys by seeing all of these .
[native] the polls i was referring to were the latest ones from [ icm ] ( http://www.icmresearch.com/data/media/pdf/2014_july_scotlandpoll8.pdf ) , [ tns brmb ] ( http://www.tns-bmrb.co.uk/uploads/files/tnsuk_som_datatables2014july18.pdf ) , [ survation ] ( http://survation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/scottish-omnibus-july-record-tables.pdf ) , [ yougov ] ( http://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/ebzazz6em9/times_scotland_results_140629_tuesday_w.pdf ) and another from [ tns brmb ] ( http://scotlandseptember18.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/125385_independence_poll_final_media.pdf ) since they were all the ones released within the last month .
[non-native] by summarizing the above points there is a need to have a broad knowledge of many acedemic subjects and specialization in one specific subject because , if a person is interested in his own field he may go that side and others can get some benefit by having atleast some knowledge about other subjects .ideas and concepts will play a major role in the development any product or component .
[non-native] alot of things play a role in making the product so appealing , a high budget advertisement even take well know celeberties to emphasis the quality of the product and to some extent we all believe the well known figurs and we might again mislead ourselves .
[native] but if i had to recommend to a mate who is an impatient cheapskate one of the two options , i would recommend g2a without even thinking about it , because there there is at least a good chance that the developer/publisher is going to see some money from it .
[native] in the film , they show that medical personnel give these women regular checkups , and explain that radiation has very little effect on the elderly : that despite the fact that they live in the exclusion zone fulltime , breathe the air , eat vegetables grown in the soil and fish caught in the rivers , and drink the water , these women are much more likely to simply die of old age / natural causes before anything radiation-related takes hold .
[native] i mean ... that 's the whole point of a upper house ... longer terms * ( or appointed by their legislature ) * so they have less to worry about when it comes to politiking & elections ... while also remaining representative of their constituents * ( even if they 're indirectly appointed by their respective legislature ... which i still think would be a vast improvement over the status quo ) * and balancing out the interests of the constituent states * ( so a single one , due to a larger population , does n't completely dominate the lower house & thus the national government ) * ... plus in this scenario the upper house would actually have real influence & power to check the lower house ... which the house of lords does n't really have besides being able to throw up a few minor roadblocks ... so i do n't understand your implication ... it 's not only a unbalanced & archaic institution ... but a almost useless one as well ...
[native] looking forward , as a qualified environmental scientist , there 's some fairly stiff limits that ca n't be ignored ( or , rather , whose * effects * ca n't be ignored no matter how far we bury our heads in the sand ) - but outside that , and assuming a measure of business as normal , i would n't see that conditions are significantly different .
[native] i mean , the atrocities committed by the russian government were inflicted on their own people as much as others , and they 've never really been a truly democratic open society so it 's difficult to place the blame on powerless individuals regardless .
[non-native] as my father an example , when my father wanted to qiut his nice job which works for government and has nice salary , all his family disagree with my father and only my mother supported him because my mother know that if my father keep doing his same job , my father 's life is that ' all .
[native] in addition , most countries consider the uk to have a greater influence inside the eu , than outside it ( for example australia loves it for it 's trade liberalization stance , particularly on the cap , or the us as a close ally within the eu ) , so you could certainly see it having diminished global influence as a result .
[non-native] all in all , i would say that the advertisement make products seem much better than they really are are understandable , the question is that how the consumer to distiguish the real quality with what the information they get from the comany , the consumer need make desision that what stuff is they really need .i think it depends how you want to travel and where are you going ? .
[non-native] in my opinion , i agree partially , that the successful people try new things and take risks rather than doing what they already know how to do well because they do not wanted to get bored with the same old ways to do things .
[non-native] i am going to study computer science next year , these are general studies about the computers , but i do not want to stay just with this studies , therefore , i will be deligthed to learn about networks and designe through computers software .
[native] > the netherlands with it is high minimum wage , austria with its social housing and collective contracts , are just the ideal target for the average for the average third-world guy who wants to start a new life as a hotel room cleaner in a rich counrty .
[native] international law is important but not un-trumpable , and international norms ... well , what need i say , they 're norms ... > any country has valid grounds for annulling any agreement they have with you on the grounds that you do it .
[non-native] i think in fact that it is true that most advertisements make products seem much better than they are , but maybe this is just due to the location of the advertisement ( for example a beach or a wonderful house ) or because of the short time they have to present the product , so sometimes a thing is shown really fast , when it is actually not .
[non-native] for instance when one ne study psychology one will need mathematical skills to be effective in its work of psychologist for example to be able to calculate and understand concepts such as standard deviation in order to interprete the results of his experiment or survey .
[native] yes , but at the same time why would you expect them to do it if literally the last time they did it not even a decade ago , within only a year a terrorist group took power and immediately began launching rockets at them ?
[native] > `` who is white ? '' is an important question that should be discussed without assuming that differing viewpoints are ipso facto `` divisive . '' ours is the only race to have devised and maintained freedom of speech and thought ; i 'm confident we can still handle a little vigorous back-and-forth .
[non-native] further more , being older , they have experienced much more than the young people and consequently know more about what are the most important things in one 's life , and will chose the meaningful way to kill their time instead of doing something senseless .
[native] problem with you and people like you is all they see about communism is the ussr , despite the fact , for example , the limerick soviet is grassroots and marxist in nature , whereas the bolshevik revolution was leninist , stalin 's rule was stalinist , and after that it was crony capitalist under the guise of marxist-leninism .
[non-native] firstly i agree with it because a tour guide is a one who knows exactly the in and out of the tour plan and where , when and how to go , it is this tour guide who helps us get aware of all the minute nuiances which are part of the tour and not be missed out , the important point being he is a professional trained in that arena than a person who is venturing out himself .
[non-native] though cars do benefits in some minor ways , and there should be a period of time to see the declining number of automobiles before the entirely disappearing of cars , the total number of cars will be fewer in the past twenty years .personnaly i do not think that young people enjoy life more than older people .
[non-native] although it may not be possible due to limitations of the life , the person should enjoy life .in my opinion , specializing in one specific subject is definetly a very important advantage in life , but you should have also a broad knowlegde of other academic subjects , too .
[native] in the case of the irish bombings in the uk - did we act like the bombings had nothing to do with ireland , talk incessantly about how not all irish people are like that , create the word northern irishophobia , and the hashtag #notallirish , or blame all the problems on anti-irish racism or inequality ?
[non-native] a study carried on consumers which were asked to drink , without seeing the products , one glass of coca-cola , and one glass of pepsi showed that 9 people out of 10 preferred pepsi , whereas when they were asked which brand they preferred and bought , 9 out of 10 answered coca-cola .
[non-native] it has a whole fancy myth behind it to which we are all attracted unconsciously .from columbia roaming around the world in his ship in search for undiscovered exoctic lands , to a family paying a weekend trip to a nearby state , we could see that people have long been enjoying the pleasure of travelling and being a tourist in foreign land .
[native] [ ** nato commander : eu could not do libya without us ** ] ( http://euobserver.com/defence/115650 ) > nato major-general marcel druart , addressing the european parliament committee on security and defence on tuesday ( 20 march ) , said nato relied heavily on us military expertise on intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance ( isr ) capabilities .
[native] i do n't want to push them about that , i 'd say is poor choice of words , but still nobody is saying the brits outside of scotland have the powers to save the union , or that they should deserve or want them .
[native] but the high profile surprise defection of conservative mp douglas carswell to ukip , and the by-election it has caused in clacton , essex meant that farage has kept the party in the headlines , and uk prime minsiter david cameron under pressure to be tougher with the eu .
[non-native] lets say if a person graduated from college and has an efficient amount of information to apply for a job and he is working right now , this person will discover that he needs to develop himself or herself more to actually coop with the outside world that is developing economically and technically at a very high rate that a person can not stay on the same level of information and wil feel that they are in need to try new things and recieve new kinds of information .
[non-native] because enjoying life varies from person to person , and what might be the correct manner in which to seize life for one individual , might not necessarily work for the next .breif news `` an adult man have been lost since 14 days '' bbb cahnnel how people enjoy their trip in vacation ? .
[non-native] being in a group and being led by a tourguide means you are completely restricted to the wishes of the group which is the decision of the majority of the group about where to go and restricted to the directions and the information provided by the tour guide .
[native] so far the supreme court had not `` extended suspect-class status to sexual orientation '' and `` other scholars disagree , arguing that `` homophobia '' is distinct from sexism , in a sociological sense , and so treating it as such would be an unacceptable judicial shortcut '' .
[non-native] of course ou have to know also the other litterature of the same period , but then you can pay your attention only on this work of petrarca , and you can understand , for example , why petrarca decided a particular order for all his poems .
[non-native] so for several years , buses have their own lines in the streets to be quicker and not stopped by the traffic , the days of big pollution there are restriction of the vehicules admitted in the streets , and parking ' price is cheaper for the resident so their cars do n't move .
[non-native] the other thing that one loves about the carefree life a young person can live that is , on his own terms and conditions whereas an older person has numerous worries to bother him such as the future of his children , family resources etc .
[native] was there not some point where you realized that your commitment to a certain impractical idea ( deport these stateless people ) has led you into the sublimely absurd ( invading the airspace of a sovereign country with the airforce so as to parachute the deportees into the territory of a country they have no legal right to enter ) ?
[native] you seriously think that starting ww3 , this time with nuclear weapons , only a year or so after ww2 ( when our armies were tired , needed new equipment etc , and our economy was failing as it was ) , in a war that would have absolutely flattened whatever remained of poland and east germany , and killed tens of millions of polish and german civilians , is a good idea ?
[native] without those provisions , the political party would still be getting strong support from the domestic fuel companies , the american company would have lost one of it 's markets , consumers would have a more expensive/inferior product , and investors in that company ( individuals like you and me who have invested money into pension funds and so on ) would have a large sum of money from their investments wiped out .
[native] what i have is a nuanced view based on a masters thesis on the wto and agricultural trade liberalisation , specifically between the eu-us and the associated research which gave me theoretical basis to state that ` free trade ' on its own ignores the problems that come about from many other fields , such as food security , homogenisation of social policies , and cultural imperialism .
[non-native] so , to call a person successful i consider it is important to see not only a part of a that person 's life and in order to have success characteristics do n't limit only in taking risks and trying new things .no one can deny that cars are so essential in the modern life .
[non-native] the other reason is in our lives almost commercials are making people to think of something or buying depends , so each commercials are trying to catch your eyes and catch your attention , and that is why many companies in thesedays are saying only good things and showing out too much lies because of making more money .
[non-native] i believe that car does n't improve our `` quality of life '' and for this reason i really do hope that in twenty years the situation wo n't be different respect i have just written in this essay .how many times do you see advertisements a day ?
[native] you 're correct about 1 + 2 , but let 's not forget that ( what 's perceived as ) a history of anti-arab/anti-muslim military acts by the west has been a larger motivator for people to sign up with isis than the desire to live under sharia itself .
[native] i never said it was beneficial for all countries in a financial sense ( i make the distinction because food security plays into it ) , but i have never said specifically that it is a better agricultural policy for sweden than if sweden had it 's own .
[native] yes and i do n't think there 's anything wrong with controlling markets through government force , markets contrary to your ideologies dogma do n't always create good in society , often left to their own devices many horrible things occur people suffer and goods and services remain unprovided or terribly inefficiently provided , and this is before we even entertain the thought of your fantasy of a market on force .
[native] and no , greek syria was where syria was , just as modern day macedonian covers a good chunk of where macedonia was ( roughly speaking - including every bit of land ever considered `` macedonia '' would actually require annexing most of the balkans , but despite hysteria from athens there 's no actual claims of irredentism from skopje . )
[non-native] know take another example from the history , the great sea explorers who discoverd america , india and many countries if they have not taken the risk and tried new paths definatly our the world will be like a hevenly body like moon , black and dark .
[non-native] the most important is to understand the topic and it not necessary to read the topic as we reproduce the topic as many times we want and ther is no matter of interuption in the middle as we can go with it and explain in better way with our new ideas and the more examples we can give to the topic and can also give the practical examples to the topic as it well now the main idea behind the topice and its applications in the real life and this all above points are applicable untill and unless we understant the idea and the concept of the topic thus importance of getting the idea behind the understanding and just learning the texti think that there is not a general answer to the statement , because it depends on the courses and on facts and concepts object of them .
[native] and there are a bunch of smaller niche/luxury/specialist irish tea companies , like the imaginatively named [ irish tea company ] ( http://www.theirishteacompany.ie ) and [ solaris ] ( http://solarisbotanicals.com/tea-shop?cat=7 ) ( the latter do the tea in insomnia coffeeshops if you 're trying to remember where you saw them ) .
[non-native] by this conclusion it is young people enjoy life more than older people ones where as in all cases but observation of the live examples also we can see that and enjoy the work in means of the people do correct things , but not doing bad things young has strtength in the body where as the older as the experience in abilty when they are also young they do like th0at itseems to us so by this reason itself young people enjoy more than the older onesat school and university , students are asked to study an enormous range of different subjects .
[non-native] in my opinion you should not lie to the customer because this will infect your company negative on the long run and you are not only responsible for your margin , as well for your employees .i think that is better before to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because in this way i can enlarge my knowledge and learn all that is possible .
[native] george friedman also talks a lot about how poland is going to be a major power in the next century and raises an interesting point : poland lies in a very important strategic position , basically the gateway for any military and trade going in between western and eastern europe .
[native] you think that 's bad , i had to resist the urge to smack a bunch of italians who must have been in their late teens when visiting auschwitz who were giggling and joking , and taking photos where they all gave two thumbs up while surrounding a sign saying auschwitz on it .
[non-native] all that concern the choices of a person depend on so many things like character , ability , past and also a little bit of luck .in my opinion the best way to travel is alone or in a very small group and without a guide .
[non-native] a third reason why i think that old people can enjoy their life as good as young once or maybe even better , but definetly not less , is that when people become older they have already set up a family and the structure is well developed and the children are often already adults and thererfor they do not need a lot of care and attention , because they are able to live on their own feets .
[native] here 's an example of why : [ why u.s. financial hegemony will endure , symposium magazine , fall 2013 ] ( http://www.symposium-magazine.com/why-u-s-financial-hegemony-will-endure/ ) . . and then the cheap remark about ` bullying ' , and `` helping to '' reduce instead of simply `` reducing '' . . all these weird code words inserted by people based on their own personal ideological leanings and hidden agendas . . you guys can do better than that .
[native] i still remember being in dachau not long after some big news stories about the various forms of torture america was employing in iraq and guantanamo , looking at an exhibit about torture and a sign about how we must never allow what happened at dachau to happen again .
[native] canadians who try and assert how different they are remind of two teenage twin girls where one stomps her feet and tries to tell everyone how unique she is because she listens to christina aguilera instead of britney spears ( by the way , is that an old example or are those broads still popular ? ) .
[native] specifically , article 33 ( 1 ) which reads as follows : `` no contracting state shall expel or return ( ` refouler ' ) a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social or political opinion '' would need to be changed .
[non-native] finally , my general idea about the statements is that we should learn ( at school , at home , with friends ) the more possible about all subject , but is important , in many case , have a specific knowleadge only about one .some people might say that try new things and take risks to suceed .
[non-native] in conclusion , successful people always take risks and try new things to seek for their possiblity .the reason that the younger seems to enjoy life more than the older generation is that they seem to have a greater ability to make what they desire for to come true .
[non-native] therefore i think that it is quite true that young people do not spend as much time for organizing events for the town 's elderly people or getting involved into cummunity meetings as 50 years ago but at the same i time i believe that it is not entirely their fault .
[native] if you want to go for the pragmatic statistics route in which you are using the * likelihood * of future crime as a justification for murder under the * assumption * that there is a possibility for release you would have : 1 ) to show that the probability of them getting released is greater than the probability of them never getting released , which given how stable western society has become is unlikely and ; 2 ) such an argument would be a basis for discrimination based on statistics against race , gender , religion , ethnicity , food preferences , etc.
[native] first of all , that does n't make it any easier to make them , second of all , they have to actually use the apis ( i do n't know anyone who did that yet ) , thirdly , this whole concept is still in beta at best .
[non-native] waiting for water fueled cars . ..this concept of young people that enjoy life more than older one is an issue that has been debated many time in the past and it will probably discuss many time in the future because everyone has his hown opinion .
[non-native] in fact , i think that , if the people would think without any advertisment , they would choose the product that has the best quality , and so the companies that are not producing good quality products have only one solution , and the solution is to make the people think their products are better than they really are .
[non-native] they can do something young people can not do thanks to better economic situation , feel more owing to their affluent experiences and do the thing that is usualy said as if the privilage for youth sach as love .young people today are faced with constant pressures from their family , school , and community .
[non-native] to sum up , i think that it is more advantageous for everyone of us to learn concepts and ideas rather facts since it can help us to achieve the full consciousness oin twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
[native] we want people to be able to come here and enjoy themselves , but also to be able to have discussion about serious topics and it is felt that a stand must be taken against low quality , instant gratification content so as to ensure this does not become like / r/adviceanimals or / r/gaming .
[non-native] in twenty years we will have lots of new ideas and inventions thats for sure but we are going to face an absoloutly big problem with the anormous number of cars being used and produced , the way i see it is that if we go on like this we might not manage to last for long .
[native] i reckon i 'll try / u/koalas-arent-bears 's methods over this spring/summer while keeping an eye out for a new one ... i 'll try and salvage it , or at least get one more crop of apples out of it , but probably ditch it after that if it does n't make progress .
[non-native] we have to find the correct balance between the two in order to be flexible and adaptable , in order to be able to response to any problems that appears but also specialiazed in one topic to have the best knowledge in front of competitors .in my country in korea , there are time to helping their communities in elementary , middel , highschool .
[native] well its got a lot of independent shops , restaurants and pubs , lots of writers live there , 60 % of the population work in the service sector ( i 'm not suggesting that 's necessarily a good thing ) , they pioneered things like `` transition towns '' , farmers markets and the lewes pound to keep money in the town for indi retailers ( bristol recently copied this ) .
[native] but i do n't think i can expect a nuanced appreciation of islam and the qur ` an from someone who posts to / r/conspiracy and who claims that muslims `` will be fighting right in europe '' and who states `` killing a muslim is always positive '' .
[native] as to your concerns , the major parties now have a solid understanding of the consequences of ruling poorly now ( remember , it was n't that long ago that three of them were n't democratic ) , and they 're the ones that make these kinds of decisions , i do n't see how the rise in extremism is indicative of them not learning to keep their house in order in the future .
[non-native] people who feel secured in their comfort zone wont try to do things new as they are scared of the failure they might come across and they will do things only if someone before them had tried and knows that it works without any problems or risks .
[native] anyway i prefer not to say `` toxic masculinity '' , instead i prefer `` toxic masculine * culture * '' instead , because i feel like true masculinity is always a good thing , is natural and pure , and is not reserved just for men either .
[non-native] unfortunately , in the real world , usually , the buyer is a human being , which means that he most probably does n't have the time , patience or even at times the expertise to make a decision based on just the specification .
[non-native] in my opinion is important , for example , for a student that choosed a scientific pathway or studies a lot of scientific subjects , to cultivate any interest in humanistic subjects like literature , philosophy , art etc. because in this way he can achieve a different point of view of the things that sourrounding him and even of this life .
[non-native] in the first 3 year of university the student will study a specific field , for example business and admistration , and in the following 2 last year the student will be able to choose an specific subject of business and administration in which he will go through to learn , finally , a job .
[non-native] after that the student will grow up and continue in his education just depending on ready facts which are in his text books .the statement `` it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects thn to specialize in one specific subject '' is a debatable one .
[native] first war with iraq saddam offered 10 $ a barrel for as long as he was alive and our company 's to have first dibs on buying , if it was about oil we would have taken that deal and the second one would not have even started .
[native] ( i am aware of d/m/y , as we also use it in french canada ) i feel like `` nine-eleven '' is just a word now and the actual meaning of september 11th is n't needed , so it looks odd to write 11/9 .
[non-native] as i said at the beginning , having a very broad range of knowledge is often dictated by our education to a certain extent ; but we 'll always have the option to specialize in a more specific topic , or guide our knowledge to a more open and general approach , by spending as long as we possibly can studying about it .it is reasnoble to me that it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
[native] `` go between us and canada due to nafta without problems '' you do realize that there are still lots of trade barriers between the usa and canada , and while there are american subsidiaries in our country , they ca n't just do as they like ?
[native] maybe it 'd cost ( say ) an extra 100-150 million dollars annually to expand our refugee quota significantly , but this would be paid off over time due to the fact that most syrians are young/able bodied/educated , and just want to live a happy and productive life like they did before the syrian civil war .
[non-native] for instance , if a shampoo is not selling enough , the company agrees with a very well known artist or popstar for showing up in an ad and saying `` i am also using this shampoo , if you want to have as beautiful hair as mine you should also use this . ''
[native] if the uk ever leaves the european union ( which i hope dearly that it does n't and am even willing to campaign on the issue ) then i am going to apply for german citizenship based on being a descendant of those who lost their citizenship at the hands of the national socialists .
[non-native] now in general broadly focusing on the issues of the younger generation the major outline we can draw is their survival in this world has become the most difficult challenge for themselves like the pace of the life , to be infront on many ocassion whether its a professional or a personal , the competition which he is forced to be a part of it .
[non-native] with all thes points , i strongly feel that it is more important for stduents to understand ideas and concepts than to leearn facts so as to gaim more knowledge about variety of subjects wihtin give academic time which can help them to broaden their future scope and carrier .i have always been told that you can never get what you want if you do not try , or in other words , if you do not take risks .
[non-native] we must be familiar with everything in order to get a deep , a complete knowledge of the matter .i agree with this statement `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' because when the people stop at one sucess than how the new invention must be happen or invented in this world , when it happens than the world stops where it is now .
[non-native] and as the advertisement is a part of the system , it has also make its jobs and show products better than they really are .the majority of people thinks that success can be achieved by a combination of different things , such as good fortune , knowledge of influential people who can help you , intelligence and self confidence .
[native] - adolf hitler with the nazi 's interest in the occult i would say at least that he was spiritual , but again there is no point speculating on it as 1 - his private and public statements contradict themselves 2 - whatever his religious beliefs , they played no part in his genocidal and imperial ambitions .
[non-native] this situation shows that facts of students take the exam and they spend a lot of moneys and hour for nothing it was onlly about the pass the exam and a result of this preparation courses do not give a chence improve the your knowledge .
[native] for a city of around 4 million , like melbourne , that has non-stop national cultural festivities ( seriously , there 's pretty much one every day on federation square ) , that has such a diverse group of people living there ( second largest greek city in the world ) , that melbourne certainly is in competition for , if not beating new york in , the place of more cosmopolitan city .
[non-native] in the end i would like to see more actions take in this direction because real the youg people are the most important thing we have to rebuild our community in a desant way that the country could be respacti disagree with that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
[non-native] finally , a product can never be known by the population if there is no advertisements to avoid what happened to my country , governmeent to take all the necessary precaution to protect consumers and government should encourage population to set up many consumers associations in order to revendicate when it is necessary .media and advertisement have one goal : to promote and sell their product .
[native] when you argue conspiracy theory ` eu has been hijacked , theyre trying to make everyone super poor ' nonsense , you do n't put up any facts as proof , and the few examples you give are hardly rigorous enough lend support so such vast claims .
[native] stop acting like your government did anyone else a * favour * , brutal austerity was imposed on everybody else due to a crisis which german economic policies had no small hand in creating as well as the reality that any and all financial assistance given by germany was done so purely to protect its own interests .
[native] please either re-read my comment and respond to the points i raised ( in reply to your points ) , or go away and actually have a think about * why * you believe what you believe and whether they are rational beliefs grounded in sound logic .
[native] even if we were to assume that the eurasian union is n't designed to be the soviet union 2.0 and instead really was based on the eu , complete with democratic supranational institutions , russia would still easily dominate it due to the size disparity of the member states .
[native] to be honest , even though i 'm a hardcore leftie and isis is on the opposite side of the spectrum of my own beliefs , after all this `` oh noe terrists '' bullshit in nz and the new spy laws , i 've pondered wearing an isis tshirt around just to fuck with people .
[non-native] also in my life i experienced , that if i will get a detailed knowledge in some areas i have to understand the simple and basic concepts , without this understanding it | s not possible to go on .i believe that successful people are successful because thay have taken risk in their lifes , however some people could argue that a successful life stands on what you think is being success for you .
[non-native] for example , in marketing we are taught a lot of theories which are said to make a product more attractive , or to make a firm more succesfull ; we have to learn these theories by heart which is difficult for a lot of students , as they do n't have the opportunity to actually test this idea .
[non-native] when i want to travel i found any friend who was traveled in that place to aske him about the place and i go to internet to see what the now place .our education system is always being criticized because of its non-analytic education .
[native] [ where terrorism finds support in the muslim world ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2006/05/23/where-terrorism-finds-support-in-the-muslim-world/ ) [ beliefs about sharia ] ( http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-beliefs-about-sharia/ ) [ islam 's trajectory ] ( http://www.cepos.eu/pdf/revista%20de%20stiinte%20politice%20nr%2029.pdf ) [ the world 's muslims : religion , politics and society ] ( http://www.pewforum.org/files/2013/04/worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-full-report.pdf ) [ public opinion in the islamic world on terrorism , al qaeda , and us policies ] ( http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/pdf/feb09/startii_feb09_rpt.pdf ) edit : hilarious to get downvotes on legitimate , well researched pew polls .
[non-native] and one more thing that is important is to understand the ideas , these understandings will be helpfull to solve the problems , that is what the souce is given and what we have to do this idea is very important as which will gives the solution to the problem .
[non-native] and a person benefits the most by his broad information is the intellegence and the experiences that could help him in how he lives his life , the way he thinks about things , the way he reacts to certain things , his interests his taste .
[non-native] therefore it is recommend for young people to give eoungh time to helping their communitieseveryone in the world has a life , and everyone wants to enjoy the life , but not every one can has what he or she wants , whatever , i am agree with that statement wich says young people enjoy the life more than older people because the young people are good at sports more than old people and young people have more time to live .
[non-native] while the young ones have an urge to express themselves and show their way of enjoying , the elder enjoy more for themselves , intristic and quiet .i dont agree with `` jack of all traits and master of none '' i personally feel its better to expertise in a single feild rather than trying to have a broad knowledge in many academic subjects since , it will lead us no where .
[non-native] after all the world is shrinking in a small room and is available on the single click of mouse then it requires both general as well as specialised people for its developmenti diagree with this statement : in my opinion you should concentrate on one - or at most two - academic subjects .
[non-native] another factor which makes a young boy go fishing , is the number of places that we have for children to have fun and play and at the same time the absence of places that tell our children about out community and that we actually have duties towards our community .
[non-native] if you want to become an important person you have always to take risks : if you have a good idea , that you think will be a succesful one , you have to develop it and to accept the probability to loose everithing .
[native] the banks are n't lending money out because there 's no demand for credit , and there 's no demand for credit because there 's no consumer demand to support economic growth ( plenty of firms are sitting on a war chest of money too , and they 're not seeing a good opportunity to use it ) .
[non-native] this last point is very important because we live in a changed world where everybody tryes to do something new and if we are able to decipher concepts , of course we will be capable to create , invent ideas in benefit of diferent fields like in medicine , computers or in other field .
[native] either you 're purposefully misunderstanding what i 'm saying , you 're not reading it properly , or you 're an idiot , and in each case there 's no point in me continuing this until you wrap your head around the fact that there is a great deal more to ` good policy ' ( which you claim free trade is ) than looking at merely one discipline .
[non-native] example to make you understand more , if you want to work as an engineering for cars you would study physic and math topics , but if you studied in everything wonot help you because you wonot need all that knowledge in this specific work .
[native] it manifests itself everywhere , in the whole paternalistic `` women and children first '' , through girls being taught by pop culture to be insecure and self-conscious , taught that their true value is in how sexually attractive they are , how many hobbies are male-dominated and exclusive towards women .
[non-native] for all of the reasons , i mentioned above i believe that it is a much safer , and more interesting experience to travel with a tour guide , if of course traveling to a country for the first time .in general , i would say that both are important and they complement to each other .
[native] politicians have to do things , at least every few years , from time to time , they ca n't get away with pretending to be in gridlock 100 % of the time - all isds means is that all those things have to effect all corporations in a positive manner .
[native] well he is planning on creating an ombudsman who will be directly responsible for overseeing canadian international mining efforts , which up to now we 've never had , and he has a voting record of taking an anti-mining stance in the past , so i guess we 'll see what happens .
[native] we still let you guys in the union and will ultimately allow unlimited travel for all eastern europeans ( sorry , not clear on the current status of right to work and too lazy to look it up ) who are part of the eu .
[non-native] because if students under stand ideas and concept thay can make some realiton ship between things and discover many new things in this life more than things they learning yn thear schools i think the main think in this topic is the theory of teaching in our class if we think by the tradshnal way we will foucs about teaching facts but if we understsnd anew teching theory we will must go teach ideas and concepts i bleave that evry teacher need to study at first how to learn and teaching then they will go to our schools in fact most of our teachers do not now tha bad effiect thay are leave it in students thinking way and on there life in futare of this students and also on thear socaity some time we need to teaching the logic in our schools to be a very good thinking people i think we need abig chang in our way thinking to reche to agood and active way in method of learning and teaching at the end i think it is the big topiq and need more descitioni agree with the idea that people should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects instead of just specialize in one certain subject .
[non-native] so , hopefully , the picture is not so bleak , at least as long as my friends persist in their altruism .i disagree with thoose who think that in twenty year there will be fewer cars in use than there are today , because it is a cheap way to travel , car is very comfortable and with the car you can reach almost of all places in the world .
[native] given that the eu is one of the most powerful entities in the world , not to mention it 's a supranational federation that encompasses most of europe , i think that it is n't exactly a problem that it 's discussed nor do i think it 's over-represented in discussion .
[non-native] like getting the idea why cars need water , the idea not only to let people know the is water in the care , but the car use water to cool the engine , so after the student get the idea the can bild there facts .
[non-native] this is why it is better to have people specialize in one subject because it will make them understand it better and it will also add to the diversity of our world .life is not merely breathing but experiencing the new adventures that every day brings .
[native] and there 's a lot of knowledge i have at the moment , but ca n't quite make use of , but would will very easily be able to when i start evening classes again next week ( they stopped for the summer ) .
[non-native] first , the young people now experience more presssure in their job and study than before , they have to work very hard to compete their peers , which make them really lack of time to have other activities insteading of working or studying .
[native] for as much as gold continually rised in value it did so for most of history at a fairly steady and predictable rate , the same is not true of bitcoin and soon when it loses any functional as a transactional tool which arguably has already occured there will be a sudden drop as people attempt to swarm out of the market with no one willing to exchange them for material wealth .
[non-native] therefore , the reasons why there might be fewer cars in use twenty years later are unaffordability of fuel , increased environment consciousness , development of public transport , changing trends in the workplace and failure of alternative sources of fuel .i completely agree with this issue that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
[non-native] it is also harder for older people to enjoy their time because they are the ones teaching and taking care of the children that have yet to learn and understand , so while the children have no resposibility but to learn , the adults are responsible for their acitons as well as they are responsible for the children .
[native] it 's not like he can call emergency services or anything in a war zone so his only option is to give it to the rebels who probably shot the plane down or find someone who can hand it over to an official for him .
[non-native] i did n't mean old people can not enjoy life but they have more restriction than young people .to me both aspects are important because a student should have the knowlege and the understanding of the idea and the concepts of an specific topic before they learn a fact on it .
[native] second off , the reason i posted that article is because it does a good job of showing why this is no longer just a spat or exchange of critical remarks , but rather a sea change in us policy toward the current israeli regime .
[non-native] thus it is important to have knowledge of the subjects which can have an influence on one 's core area of work and have specialization in the core area .i completely agree with the statement that `` it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . ''
[non-native] however , their exaggerating , hiding some informations , and making misunderstnading can make people to buy what they do not need .successful is what eny one of the world loking about it becouse if you think about it eny want to be success eny who have agob want to have a good selare tobe seccess that whay the seccess is an inmportant thing .
[non-native] while the former generally enjoy stronger and healthier bodies that help them carry out and enjoy more intense physical activities , the latter are normally considered to be wiser and more experienced , and therefore better positioned and endowed to enjoy the quieter pleasures that life offers and fight the battles that it often presents .
[non-native] for me , the most important in the life is the evolution , to come back to my introduction , obsviously i think that we are not in the same feeling in the two cases ( besides , some studies show that it is right ) .
[native] the uk have their `` brit-ish '' former subjects to fall back on if they do end up leaving , whereas other european countries have to either get on with one another or face a world of trading partners who are all equally indifferent to them .
[non-native] while they need to promote and even enhance the qualities and capacities of a product in order to incite consumers to buy it , they tend to exaggerate and paint an inaccurate picture of its real skills , which can lead to frustrating consumer experiences .with the above made statement , i fully agree for the following reasons : the best example would probably be the tobaco advertisements shown on tv , the cinema or as large posters at bus stations .
[native] a country like nigeria would need around 28 years with an average 5 % growth rate ( which is very optimistic , as their average for the past is maybe half that ) to achieve this level , and in these 28 years immigration would increase dramatically .
[native] and i ca n't express how glad i feel that america has moved to spike that long-term strategy in the above paragraph by pressing the issue on ukraine & the baltics , making the german government & elites choose which way they 're going to go , right now and in front of the rest of the eu .
[native] but i 'm not so sure if it 's meant to be a face , it would be a big step away from his very detached style , there 's a massive gulf between the artist and how he expresses himself , to include a face would bridge that gap and shatter the cold abstract viewpoint i 'm getting from his art .
[native] if cars are n't getting routinely serviced , getting insurance , etc then it 's to the detriment of customers , whilst keeping the number of licenses limited through high entrance barriers means that taxi companies can charge a living wage for their services , as opposed to fighting over scraps and having to work 15 hour days .
[native] yeah , you guys did n't have to sit through two years of charles krauthammer in the run-up to the 2003 iraq war , you did n't have to sit through him bleating on about what a good idea it was to re-elect bush in 2004 , you did n't have to sit through him for the first decade of the 2000s where everything he said was a neoconservative talking point . . you did n't have to sit through him talking about how good of a candidate sarah palin would be . .
[non-native] another example is that now-a-days the software companies are looking for proffessional students never bothered about to which branch they are related and also they are giving training about the work they had to do for the company and they are selecting on the basis of the academic subjects what they had .
[native] they made a big deal about the russian airspace story , though i have not heard it actually violated the airspace of russia , it did violate swedish airspace to run away from the russians , it was an rc-135 , and the reason they fucked off and made a big deal out of it was because the russians did the highly unusual and actually locked onto the plane with sa missiles .
[native] i 'd like to have trusted labour to give us the chance to have rpf as our flag , but they selfishly and shortsightedly traded that chance for the opportunity to retaliate -- which probably wo n't even work because i think most people will just see it as political brinkmanship -- the danger being that we end up with an ugly , crap flag for the rest of nz 's history .
[native] the point * i 'm * making it though is that if russians were to threaten nukes if they were in a losing situation , nato would never push them that far in a war , so russia could never be in a losing situation .
[non-native] it is time to change and everybody cares about our future , so for this reason it is time that all the government of the world start to think about that and not just to have a better future , but to have a future that permit human beings to live in a safe world .
[non-native] taking into account of what have been discussed above , we may reach the conclusion that the undergraduate students should have broad knowledge of many academic , and the graduate students are more suitable to study in one specific subject .i agree that is most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
[non-native] also if my school would not have lowered the number of courses , students would have never been able to really specialize in a subject , but would have simply seen the overview of it , never fully understanding each and every one of those subjects .
[native] poverty and child abuse go hand in hand -- and under the national government of the early 90s child poverty increased exponentially until , under the new labour government , it fell by 70 % in only 4 years following the introduction of working for families .
[native] even though i have had many , many terrible run ins with obnoxious , arrogant , idiotic , jingoistic , nationalist , pretentious , shitty europeans , i could still set all that bullshit aside and extol the many virtues of europe and europeans .
[native] i do n't need to have approval of someone consistently coming up with baseless accusations to be able to read the closest dictionary , to know i 've never `` whined '' about trump being persecuted , or that i 've never denied the existence of climate change .
[non-native] also company that amkes cars are going like a wind i nthe market of cars peaople are wating for the newer in ever year so the butter car looked from how strong or the shaepd of it the size people will still have to buy it .
[non-native] there will always be more problems in this continent than helping hand , however , we can start by increasing the help to our communities and do the best we can to improve the lives of the communities we live in .if you open a textbook , for example a math one used in the past at school , it 's quite easy to notice that each theory and concept is followed by a practical example that explains and allows the student to get a better understanding of the cited rule .
[non-native] in conclusion , even through cars is also very important now , the develpment of technolgy and awearness of people in the enviorment will lead the number of cars fewer than there are today .will there be fewer cars on road twenty years later than there are today ?

[non-native] for example if we ask a young boy weather he likes to go fishing or go clean the beach from wastes , his answer is going to be `` lets go fishing '' , he might not even know that there are some people whom actually clean the beach .
[non-native] even though group travel has a lot of advantages due to the company of people who can assist you in unfamiliar place and the luxury of a guide who can tell you exactly where to go and what to see , it is not always the best ways to travel to all destinations .
[non-native] we had a few accedents of slipping on a weat rocks , but alos we did a break to share our food together and talk about our lives , then when we continued our trip it start to rain and the wind blowes , and unexpected one of our friend slipped and broke her ancle and could not walk so her husband had to carry her and because of that we were delayed in reaching th epoint were there two official people from the blue mountian waiting to receive us , because of our delays the official people alret the ranger to look for us , sany whay lstatements about the future are always extremely unpredictable .
[native] a study by the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) determined that the `` boil down time '' for spent fuel rod containment ponds runs from between 4 and 22 days after loss of cooling system power before degenerating into a fukushima-like situation , depending upon the type of nuclear reactor and how recently its latest batch of fuel rods had been decommissioned .
[non-native] another example that i can give is that i would do the engineer after the university and not the employee for the rest of my life , becouse in my opinion is better the life of a free professionist , who can spend his time and his money in the way who he can think is right , than the life of the employee , who is not indipendent and has the same conditions of life for many time .
[native] decades of economics that are specifically designed to benefit germany by draining/weakening the rest , and a foreign policy focused on appeasing russia to open it 's resource markets at the determinant of eastern european countries ' * ( in addition to a weak focus on hard power ) * is n't going to surprise me at all .
[non-native] for example , i see my father as successful pearson because he has high possation in his major , he is teacher , and in another hand , he dos n't like try any thing new , he is always do the same thing every day and for a many years , so as a result , he had high possation now .
[native] two points one : it would be hugely inconvenient for you at this present time , with the way the industry is structured at the moment , but if more laws were introduced to protect workers , then the inconvenience would hardly be noticed , in the same way you do n't see it as inconvenient that you ca n't call your colleagues up at 2am local time .
[non-native] in the end i think i can say , that it is important to to have both if you want to be sucsessful in life , wether its in the private sector or in the business one .in my opinion the best option is to have knowledge of many academic subjects .
[native] if a foreign insurance provider either establishes a subsidiary in the us , or buys a us company , or more ominously , if an existing us insurer simply moves to establish themselves as residing in a post office box a signatory nation as many us corporations have indicated that they would like to do .
[non-native] so i think that there will be more cars in twenty years than they are today .this is a very difficult question to answer because i 've seen some old people enjoying their life everyday and some young people worry about their future and its challenges .
[native] tokyo , hiroshima , nagasaki , fukushima and i 'm pretty sure there 's some sort of place called osaka ... yeah just drop tokyo in the middle and the other four at random locations and that 'd be me done , also two islands at a random spot near my poorly drawn japan marked iro jima and okinawa .
[non-native] in my personal case , since i tend to be late at my school and i 'm not the typical student who are very organized and scheduled in time , i prefer to get my private helicopter in the future .i agree with the statement young people do not give enouh time to helping their communities .
[non-native] thus , successful people are those who not only try new things and takes risks but makes there every move in order to help and improve the place or conditions people live in .yes i agree with the topic , young people enjoy life more than older people .
[non-native] having all these in my mind , i believe that the ideal solution to this complexity will be making use of an appropriate combination of these approaches while we have time and then plan our future studies accordingly .people respond differently to the issue of `` do advertisements mislead people 's feeling on the products ?
[non-native] some peole may argue that young minds are generally burdened with matters like their future prospects and academic career , but younger generations has an inner desire ( or we can say some sort of fire ) to succeed and excel in every field of life which extinguishes in older people .
[non-native] then , i thought of taking a glimpse of my life , and after a long look , i found out that i do not really spend my time in hat i love to do , and i had the explanation for that , which is ll the other hings ihave to do , because i am still a dependent person in everythingm and i can not do whatever i like to do because there is a duty that i have to do in life , while my grandmother is independent , knows what she wants , andhas the time to do it all , so she 's the one who 's given the chance to enjoy her life .
[non-native] this is very important issue about the education because the students have to know every thing about the life and the world from their schools and teachers and their educational books , i think the education is kind of curiosity that has to give the students all what they need .
[native] in the us the races are n't as lineated as in europe or anywhere else , and the big categories are `` white '' ( which included dozens of countries , including some which most europeans would n't even consider `` white '' to begin with ) , `` black '' ( again , includes the entirety of a massive continent with thousands of different ethnicities in some cases genetically divided by millenia , plus the average black american has european heritage too ) , `` hispanic '' ( which includes black , white , and brown people from everywhere south of the us ) , etc.
[non-native] the main reason is that to develops thoughts we need to connect elements , and we need enough information in our mind to formulate a good relation between them and find a good idea or innovative thoughtor or solution to problems we have to solve .
[native] hmm ... ( imo greenpeace is * far * worse compared to modern communist parties in democratic countries ; they openly use obviously illegal methods and often support token environmentalism with no good effect on the environment ( anti-nuclear being the most obvious example ; save < insert-random-not-so-endangered-not-so-ecologically-important-species > being another ) )
[non-native] on the plus side , like it is written before , understanding deeply the concepts help you to see what is happening in the world with your own mind and to be critic too , so you can say what do you thing is running great and what is not .
[native] secondly , the only other option was to go back to the 1992 amendment , which gave crimea much greater autonomy , and as they would have been basically a puppet of russia still , i 'm sure it would n't have been long for them to show support and want to join it since they had greater autonomy .
[non-native] first of all because they have nothing to loose and second because in this manner they will have a chance to show their capabilities and to create a stronger character by challenging themselves .sucess people are those person who suceed in his/her field with good result .
[native] sometimes that can seem burdensome and/or damaging ( the working time directive is a sore point for the uk , for example ) because it introduces a standardisation that would n't otherwise happen - but that is also the point , and for cross-border businesses ( anyone importing or exporting ) it represents a huge * increase * in efficiency .
[native] i think a good word for it might be `` sensitivity '' , in that plenty of trans people feel like crap because they know the average person 's perceptions of trans people may be completely skewed by unrepresentative examples of trans people in media .
[non-native] taking into consideration all these factors , it is clear that young people , can live a bigger , stronger and more funfilled life than what their counterparts can , well they must have passed through their youth phase in their life and will surely have had a lot more activity then than what they are having now .
[native] sure , russia is a big bad scary bear who wants to eat your children , but do n't try to point out something they do , without realising your self , that many others , including your own , do this too , even if they keep it under wraps .
[non-native] to sum up , i should say that i agree with the idea of knowing single subject but being the expert of that field , is far more better than having broad knowledge of many subjects which is identical to being able to talk of many subjects at first but is not able to keep pace with the real experts of that particular subject .
[non-native] this last part of my text shows what i think : it is easier to enjoy your life if you have enough money in order to buy you all the things you will enjoy and also because when you are older , you have built the life you wanted , while when you are young you do not always have the choice of everything and you need to obey to your parents .today , there are many advertisements all around in our lives , and the purpose of them are attracting customers to buy products which advertisements are about .
[non-native] secondly , not to show over images of products means that companies can continue to manage for long time .yes , i agree with the statement that young people are not showing up intrests in helping the communities rather most of them are intrested in other useless activities as far as concerned .
[non-native] from spreading awareness against diseases to providing free tuition classes and community services in free for all schools , the younger generation has really opened its eyes and is surely aiming at making the earth a better `` community '' to live in .the issue whether `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' is a contraversial one .
[native] ... typhus , leishmaniasis , or factitious disease , esophageal rupture with a subsequent compartment syndrome , a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm , or pancreatitis caused by a gallstone , an enlarged spleen , extramedullary hematopoesis ( the production of blood cells outside the outside of the bone marrow ) , tuberculosis , brucellosis , lymphoma , or sarcoidosis .
[non-native] in conclusion , be wise and pay attention to what is going around you , because you might reach a certain point that you might lose yourself following dreams that does not even exist .firstly , i thing that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects may be , culturally speaking , really interesting but that it can also lead to a confused professional guide line in the future .
[non-native] i know some saines you ca n't see it but you can imagen it and you 'll see it in the fact like in mathematiches , visecal or fasical so i like change the education from the first year in the elmantry scohle if thay can do that we 'll get alot of smart chaildren and thay can make agood live withe agood educathion .
[native] the only reason china is as impressive a power and manufacturing hub as it is is that they 've got a billion and a half people who 's rights and wages are being suppressed and their environment is being thrown under a bus in the name of industry .
[non-native] the trip will be diffenitly more valuable if it is spent with such great accompany .in this world you can find people who have a broad knoledge of many academic subject which can do lot of very basic things and people who are specialized in one specific subject and can resolve very complex problems about a subject .
[non-native] for this to achieve there are no secret formulas , there are no new things to try , nothing like that , but doing what must be done , and what has been done since the early years of this sport , working for it .
[non-native] therefore , discouraging oppertunities for youngs to fully enjoy life as the adult who have more freedom , do .i agree with the opinion thjat young prople og today 's world are not that inclined towards community services as was the scenario some decades ago .
[non-native] if these inventions see the light and prove to be good it will affect the market share held by these firms and in the future it can take to their complete dissapearance .i agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
[non-native] most of the product appear on the net or the tv screen much better than they could be in our kitchens or our garages .i want to go to many places which i do not know yet because the travel is fun for me .
[native] those pakistani pedophile rape gangs are a figment of my imagination and the imagination of all 1,400 + victims in one town alone ( not even counting rochdale , telford , oxford , bradford , etc ) lee rigby 's beheading is also a figment of my imagination .
[non-native] if you would graph the failures and success of two different businesses , one who makes small changes , or even none , over a long period of time , and then of another business who is making constant changes and is playing with their possibilities and the freedom they have available , you will see that business one will have a postivie rising curve , and that business two will have a line that in - and decreases from time to time .
[non-native] after showing the advantages of each choice , my opinion is that even if you have to be specialized in one specific subject , is also important not to be focused only on it , but you must have a wide mind , becuase you ca n't even know what will happen to you in the future .
[non-native] generally , the place we are going to travle may be a brand new location which we have never been to and know less before the travel , therefore , lots of practical problem such as accomadation , transportation and so on will be encounted , led by a tuor guide who may help us to reduce the time wasted on those poblems .
[non-native] i also think that in twenty years there will be fever cars in use than there are today . ..yes the above statement `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' .
[native] however , wanting to join a nuclear alliance , move the nuclear weapons to somewhere else in the uk and cause the taxpayer in the rest of the uk huge expense at a time that we are just emerging from recession and european security is threatened strikes me as a bit of an odd opinion .
[native] obama does n't give a fuck about russia , the germans had spent decades crafting their * ostpolitik * policy of engaging russia as a partner , france / italy / spain had a growing economic relationship with russia ( which they desperately needed after the 2008 crisis ) and * londongrad * was earning the british finance sector billions .
[native] maybe , just * maybe * if the us had been able to produce enough nukes fast enough we * might * have * just * been able to defeat the soviet union by nuking every city we could get to in russia , but more likely we would have declared war on them and then been swiftly and painfully defeated , and every country in europe would have been red .
[native] a typical western city is like mad max compared to a typical japanese city , so i 'm not really surprised at all that they do n't want to visit a country that borders a war zone , which has had multiple suicide bombings in the last year .
[native] i always assumed it was some obscure trojan horse thing , but apparently ( [ wiktionary ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/don%27t_look_a_gift_horse_in_the_mouth ) ) : > since horses ' gums recede as they age , which makes the teeth appear to grow long , checking the teeth of a horse given as a gift is a way of checking for old age .
[native] us laws are now so large and complex that they incorporate a legal structure that allows them to grow as new instances arise : the frank-dodd act being a prominent example of regulation that requires regulators to create more regulations as cases present themselves .
[non-native] however , sometimes these advertisements make the customer see the advantage of this product which it is very helpful for the people to be get that product as soon as possible to receive that product and it make you feel better to buy an insurance for your things that you bought from them .
[non-native] if you study medicine , that means that you want to become a doctor ; if you study law , it means that you want to become a lawyer ; - the other is for the people who does n't know exactly , or at all , what to do .
[non-native] i experienced that before traveling the osaka in japan , the tour company that i chose suggested different options , if i added the tour guide to my travel , the tour company required almost twice cost as another which did not include guide .
[native] / s c'mon , a bit of criticism of rushed political policies in a crisis is completely reasonable , but let 's not pretend that german culture is so fragile that adding 1 million new people to a nation of 80 million is the straw that will break the camel 's back .
[non-native] of course we could use a train or a bus , but in my case it would be cheaper just about a fifth of the costs i pay for going by car and the other aspect , the far more important , is , that it would take me about half an hour more every day , what means that this is an hour i can spend less with my family .
[non-native] according to the tour guide it may be the best way because in your group most of the peoples know and they can give you the better idea that where you have to go and wher you can get a lot of fun and they can tell you where you are going wrong .
[non-native] although a lot of people do not like to take risks and never give themselves the good experience of improve theirs skill only because they fell scared of change or they think that have lack of capacity or qualities to do any specific task that you can make .
[non-native] another of an important learning area could be the crop survelliance techniques which could be utilised to fore-warn the farmers about the outbreak of crop epidemics so that preventive measures are taken and farmers donot lose their hard raised crops and avoid huge annual losses to pest attack .
[native] > when it [ launched its spectacular offensive ] ( http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6436f754-fd18-11e3-bc93-00144feab7de.html ) through northern iraq in june , the [ islamic state of iraq and the levant ] ( http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/69e70954-f639-11e3-a038-00144feabdc0.html ) , known as isis , bulldozed a berm on the border with syria .
[non-native] so , according to me it will be very difficult to see less car in the nex future because the goverman have not only to increase the public trasport but also to change the mentality of a lot of people .it is a well-known fact that cars are one of the major causes of pollution nowadays .
[native] i do n't like standing by and knowing that fmg , for instance , is taking place , but i 'm also not going to let me self be ployed into the trap of thinking that `` doing something '' is better than `` doing nothing , '' especially when doing something means sending killing hundreds and maybe thousands of people .
[non-native] next , many people says that are worried about the contamination of the use of the car and the consecuences that have in the ozone layer , but after saying this , they choose the car for going to work instead of going in bus , in bycicle or only walking with his own legs .
[native] the same effect can indeed achieved by increasing peoples access to credit because it creates short term disparity in supply/demand since everyone with money wants to `` buy now '' look if there is one thing i know well it 's bubbles after making quite a bit in the most obvious bitcoin bubble last november and i 'm still making money by shorting the price back down until it 's in a more normal range .
[non-native] in my opinion , the speed of images prevent us from thinking and will cause the disappearance of human qualities .i would agree the observation that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide if i have to select either `` agree or disagere '' .
[native] on the continent , it used to seem wildly inconvenient to limit the amount of time training doctors were allowed to work , but after the introduction of the eu working time directive ( which did just that ) the difference is hardly even noticed , and training doctors actually get to sleep and relax occasionally !
[native] if this gets big press attention * it might be the blow that finally sinks cameron , the article says the moneys due 2 weeks after the rochester by-election ( tory defected to ukip , cameron is throwing everything at the seat to try and win but polls put them 13 % behind ) .
[non-native] in conclusion , the trends laid out above are providing enough information to suggest that there will be less cars in use twenty years from now .although some people think that to learn facts is more importantfor students to understand ideas i agree with the statement it is more important for students to understand the ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because firstly if they understand the ideas then they produce new ideas and facts secondly they can learn the facts much easier and faster .
[non-native] most advertisements make the products look better , but the customer is aware that everything is not said or explained , he must read between the lines and use his personal experience and knowledges .i sadly have to agree somehow to the statement and say that it is true .
[non-native] in order to make the statement come true the growth rate in the number of cars in use should actually be negative , and i do n't think that is going to happen in the next 20 years ; the potential to grow is still overwhelming .we are living in a community and have some responsibilities because of this .
[native] '' , but what would actually be achieved is turning the ep into a european government by default , without first creating a european demos , and robbing the member state governments of their reason for creating and supporting the eu in the first place , when they still control and provide 80-90 % of `` eu '' functionality and all of its funding .
[native] but in australia , it seems that theres a 50/50 split ( along socioeconomic lines more than anything else ) of people that refer to them as the first category ( asylum seekers and refugees ) and those that see them in the second category .
[non-native] developed countries like the united states , the majority of european countries together with japan are experiencing constant demand of cars since more and more people are becoming independent and therefore need a car for going to work , for their spare time spent in travelling , reaching other people to different places .
[non-native] you can go to bolivia and you can look for handmade alpaco hats and local colrful clothes , you can pay a lot for over priced fake products and you can miss whole unique and genuine hand craf - ted local products just because of your ignorance .
[native] > the real question is , why is the `` international community '' so eager to force israel to recognize the independence ( on terms favorable to the arabs ) of a state filled with people who nakedly proclaim their intention to commit genocide on any and all jews remaining in their country ?
[non-native] in conclusion i think that the number of cars will increase in the future due to the fact that can be related as a consequence and a step of the growing process of the economy of a country .over generations , the way people want to travel has changed .
[non-native] of course , the abillity to write scientific texts is a crucial prerequisite to this kind of job but it will be also extraordinary helpful to have a broad spectrum of academic knowledge and insights if you are willing to get a scientific writer .
[non-native] well without his experiments , you could n't think that it 's actually true , however the concept could have made you think that it was applicable to anyone , however , scientists have proven that it 's not this simple , regarding humans in particular .
[non-native] on the one hand , even though a lot of persons can think that having information about a variety of subjects could make a professor or a student to have a better backwround in his or her professional formation , on the other hand , i consider it is negative not to have a deep knowledge of one main area .
[native] > vattenfall signs contract with the city of hamburg to build a new coal power plant , the green party ( which was ruling hamburg at the time in a coalition government ) kept arbitrarily creating and raising regulatory standards with the aim of stopping the power plant .
[non-native] nowadays , the competition is very drastic , every body has ambition to be the first , if i just have specialize in one specific subject , i could not allow to have various job oppotunities , and also i will lose some good chance .
[non-native] we humans can live doing the same thing much years , repeating the same , but we always going to find in the very deep part of our mind a good reason to do that , a reason about improving , creating or making something new .the above statement that is `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' it is not right .
[non-native] and we should alway wonder if we really need a new kind of pen , if what we are using it 's perfect for itself .i totally agree with this sentence : young people nowadays do mot give enough time to helping teir communities .
[non-native] for example , in turkey. a student who has understood the ideas and concepts to learn the facts by reading them and applying in them in his life , sees the consequences and sets the true relation between them to become improved individual for the public .
[native] if i come prepared with quinoa or a smoothie or something ( things i like to eat ) , maybe i 'll have more time to smoke and eat ( i do n't need to eat a lot , just a few mouthfuls to honour that hunger right now so i do n't panic and overeat later ) .
[non-native] to conclude one shall think differently , do things which were not tried before and take calculated risks to be successful .the issue of education is controversial due to lot of thinks and particulary we can ask ourselves if is it more important to teach ideas and concepts or only facts ?
[native] i 'm not entirely sure how not supporting either side gives me an irrational disdain of the eu , even if i do think that this crisis has been spurred on by the eu , who were perfectly happy to encourage the regime change in kiev and then did n't back it up .
[non-native] a close look at a typical family reunion , e.g. , thanksgiving , where different age groups of one family get together , reveals that the difference in perceiving joy in life may very well be associated with the age of a certain person .
[non-native] thus , older people enjoy more life than younger people do because the former knows how to employ it 's time to enjoy life best on the contrary of the latter which does n't .i agree with the statement that successful people have more brave to take risks than they is doing the same thing all the time .
[non-native] in conclusion , i would rather disagree with this statement because i know that there are young people who have enough time to help .the poet rimbaud said in one of his masterpiece `` we are not serious when we are 17 years old '' .
[non-native] not to mention , that there are people who are able to manage this so called busy schedule of theirs and realise that helping others is the biggest virtue of human beings , these people perform the dual role of achieving their ambitions and also helping some people round them in whatever way they want can .i agree with this statements .
[native] thus the european investment bank could launch a big ( say $ 300 billion , or $ 383 billion ) expansion in investments such as faster cross-border rail links to more integrated electricity grids -- and raise the money by issuing bonds , which the ecb could buy in the secondary market .
[native] as for the projection of identity , putin is very much trying to recreate the image of the ussr or even a new imperial russia , this is shown abroad and domestically in russia with the promotion of a pan-slavic identity , eurasianism , and the twisting of history .
[non-native] the idea of the advertisements is that the people really want to obtain a specific product even if they have not taken , so in my opinion the creation of an advertisement is a business work , is a marketing job and what the factories want to do is to offer a product that seems great because if the people see something that it looks good and special is possible that they are going to get it and try it .
[non-native] that is all i could say for this statement and i think i have said alot of thing in it so enjoy life and enjoy reading it .wheter it is more appropriate to receive a broad education or a specialized one is a common yet difficult question to answer .
[native] thus , in a two level game , the possible win-set for the international negotiation is in large part dependant on the range of acceptable outcomes in the level 2 negotiation ; that is , the larger each of the negotiating parties level 2 win-set is , the more likely they 'll overlap with the other parties in a place where both sides are satisfied with an agreement .
[native] for me personally , an lsd trip every year or so helps a lot ... it helps me zoom out and see the source of my anxieties ( some of which i might not even be aware of ) , and at the same time it helps me remember what i want and truly care about in life .
[native] moreover western economics jerks over `` free trade '' , because the truth is that it * generally * does lead to a net increase of gdp , but social concerns ( such as skyrocketing income inequality ) are palmed off to social scientists under the blase assumption that net increase in gdp corresponds with a net increase in social conditions ( real wage increase , income equality , employment etc ) .
[non-native] the other main purpose for which , the number of cars would be incresing that , the population on the earth is incresing day by day , it would be very much difficult for the mass transporation to transport as many as people who are there , therefore many people would be having an eye towards the cars which would lean them towards it .
[non-native] so much focus is put on the early specialization of the mind that the broad and not necessarily deep level of knowlegde is completely underestimated , whereas exactly this level actually makes people accessible and grants them lightness and fluency of conversation with many different people of - again - many different - social , intellectual etc. - levels .
[non-native] you will have so much fun because you are not alone and you are in harmony with people around you .when it comes to the questions of whether it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts or for the students to learn facts , different people might have totally different answers to the question .
[native] oh yeah and always be polite to the people , no matter what , and go in dressed nicely , i generally go in wearing my interview clothes when i meet my case manager the first time , after that go looking casual but presentable .
[non-native] i make a clearful plane to decide wher to go and where to live , i need to consider how much money i will spend , and if i meet some problem how to deal with , etc. , there will a lot of situation i need to think before .
[non-native] an other argument is that young people have no reponsability : they do n't have money problems , or job problems or even children problem , there parents take care of everything so they do n't have to worry about all those things that makes life difficult .
[native] well , of course if a country has more than a half of population size in comparison to the entire eu , it 's going to have a more or less correspondent academic output , and the total number of `` good '' universities will be higher just as well .
[non-native] a tipically example of this manner can be found in the most of the new invention where it 's needed a positive consideration to be lunch , like the titanic in which was n't presented the lack of ships to escape , looking only to the big fashion-style of it .the statement if successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well , is very difficult to evaluate , because it depends on how well someone does on a special topic .
[non-native] it is necessary to have a good knowledge about history facts about our musical history , like when a composer wrote a specific composition , when specific type of environment developed just to allow people to listen to music in silence , when composers start to use writing to preserve their works , how this symbolic system evolved during the centuries .
[native] i 'm planning to start a game in ck2 with the old gods dlc and then export my save into eu4 and continue ... so playing 1000 years of history :) and possibly even after eu4 exporting to victoria ii and continuing but i 'm not sure how compatible it is .
[non-native] the teacher make him/her perform the vaporation action several times , again and again and the student may perform the action very well but if the student does n't grasp why she/he is doing that , what is the importance of it or if he'she can not make the necessary connections logically and can not generalize the situation to an anvironmental reality ' then what is the meaning of it ??
[non-native] we live in a world that constantly changes and it is always better to be the one who initiates the changes than the one who is forces to adapt to the changes .have you ever uncomfortable feeling , when you watch the mass media because of news ?
[non-native] trying new things and risks handling are the tasks of successful people , because a normal man things the same way he thinks every time because he donot want to take risks he comprimises with what he had , the successful person is the one who thinks in the different way and takes risks and he owns the credit of it .
[non-native] we all have plans for the future and we know what we want to be in the future , we are aware of our abilities and interests so after calculating on all these factors one should choose a field that he wants to specialize in instead of trying to learn all subjects because it is virtually impossible for mortals to retain all that they learn in school or university .
[non-native] cars in 20 years from there will be fewer cars in use then now .generally , i do agree that young people enjoys life more than older people , because it is a matter of fact that young people lives in less stresses and responsibilities than older do .
[native] over the years in school , the only time i ever made big strides with french was in university because unlike any other teacher i had , the professor demanded that the classroom be full french immersion ( even though it was a beginner level course ) .
[native] also , there 's still the uk , france , spain , the forces the us has in europe , not to mention poland 's own military which , whilst not as big as others , is still reasonably capable and would n't be a push over .
[non-native] nevertheless , those are just some examples that appear to be high quality products , but the crucial fact is that the buyer has the choice whether to believe the incrediable presentatiopn of the product and thus buy it , or not to believe it and not buy it .
[native] i 'm sure that all users would agree what `` udontplay '' means , unlike things like `` walking simulator '' , `` sandbox '' ( widely misused everywhere ) , `` classic '' , `` replay value '' , `` action '' , `` story rich '' and many , many others , not to mention that completely subjective tags * do * exist and are widely used as well , e.g.
[native] if brexit was really about getting all the poles and romanians out , how do you think ukip is going to feel when you suggest allowing 1.2 billion indians in ... haha not going to happen , people would resort to a scorched earth policy .
[native] chances are someone is going to get fed up with the kremlin 's direction and change things internally , but a complete lack of international support for ukraine is not a good precedent , it has our allies in nato that border russia frightened that they too will be expendable in order to not `` rock the boat '' .
[non-native] conversely , what with the explosion of the global population , the swelling of the big cities and the enthusiasm for producing future vehicles , cars will still on demand .is there anyone who is successful through a entire history without challenging to a new things ?
[non-native] therefore i totally agree with the abouve statement saying `` young people enjoy life more than olkder people do '' because older people should have sweet and unforgettable memories in their age and this is can be only done by older people only if they enjoy they life in the young age .
[native] so we get more angry about the observable unfair actions of our immediate tribal members ( ie kills/moon ) , but find it a lot harder to summon up the same visceral rage when the nature of the jungle we live in makes life harder for us ( ie high house prices ) .
[native] in 2014 ( the most recent record available ) [ the uk contributed roughly $ 11b ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budget_of_the_european_union#eu-28_contributions_.282014.29 ) ( almost * half * as much as france ) and the eu turned around and directly invested ** $ 7b ** in the form of science grants , subsidies , etc.
[non-native] in today life studies are including a lot of syllubus which give a variety of ideas to youngsters , but the people who are including these syllubus into the academics are forgetting that because of this young people are unable to do their must duties and so ruining them .
[native] the netherlands only spend around 1.3 % and even in 2007 with gdp growth of 3.9 % it was only spending 1.6 % on defence , greece was at 3.4 % gdp growth in the same year and was spending 4.3 % on defence .
[native] the rise of an eu community does n't mean we are all the same in everything and everyone should be treated as europeans , particularly in events that pre-date the eu by decades , or that events that do n't are bad or ignorant .
[native] let 's not forget that the us had stationed it b52s on uk soil so that they could flow to moscow and later replaced that with a permanent base when our independent nuclear deterrent proved unsustainable * largely because the americans refused to reciprocate the information we gave them during the manhattan project * .
[native] the majority of new zealand places have a maori name , it 's a historically important language , it has over 100,000 fluent speakers , and even if it was dying , we should do everything we can to retain it as valuable part of our shared culture .
[native] amazon de was sometimes cheaper and faster , it was just too much of a hassle using google translate on the webpage ( for example , the reviews did n't translate , so i would have to copy paste them individually into google translate , and then the translation might not even make sense .
[non-native] finally , youth should work very hard to secure their future carees that compell them to show high qualifications and competency .i actually think that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
[non-native] to conclude , everybody do n't care if the product showed by the advertisement do n't seem like what they really are because the needed is to buy .more and more types of advertisements are being developed and improved , due to better knowledge and advanced technologies used by the professionnals in communication .
[native] no such legislation exists in relation to professional investors who invest in high denomination tradeable securities : indeed , the whole pattern of new legislation is specifically designed to ensure that bondholders have to bail in banks rather than be bailed out by the state .
[native] so talk about `` betrayal '' all you want , but the people at the time were making the best decisions they could with what they had , and with what they knew , to try and get the best possible outcome for the most people in europe .
[native] technically , a self-driving car would be going close to the legal speed limit ( unless there 's an eco mode or something - but you could turn that off ) , or abiding by the traffic lights or whatever - so an 'em ergency override ' button would n't make sense legally as you 'd only ever use it to break the law .
[non-native] in reason of all above mentioned facts and my own opion , which i also tried to explaind about , i think we would have everytime somethink like a car or a vehicle .although students in the same class take same courses under identical circumstances in terms of instructor , teaching aids and experience , and assigned textbooks , two groups of students may arise after that course .
[native] of course europe is gripped by nuclear phobia and i guess i kind of am too but thorium reactors do n't need to be pressurized and for a whole lot of other reasons that i ca n't be bothered summarizing they are much safer .
[non-native] the exciting will began for you when you relly start to work in your major study that youspicilzed in , you will love your work < love your life , and you will to forget you proplem and solve it or starting anew life style if we can say .some people say that successful people attempt to do new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already knwo how to do well .
[non-native] from conclusion i give message that keep knlowdge on the boared subjects , but dont neglect that subject and keep hard working on the specialize in one specific subject for more knlowdge .i believe this statement is true , but i would rather blame the community or the society than the youth .
[native] [ albertopolis , london ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/natural_history_museum_london_jan_2006.jpg ) the area of london containing the royal albert hall , the natural history museum , the science museum , the victoria & albert museum , imperial college london , the royal colleges of art and music , the royal geographic society and the royal institute of navigation .
[native] putin has occupied ukraine 's very own sudetenland , a move which was unthinkable only a year ago ; is weilding a lot of influence in hungary , banning eu food products from entering russia ( not so much a big deal since we have other markets like china to export to ; but it is still having an impact on us ) and trying to get in the way of our dealings with ukraine .
[non-native] 3 ) no air pollution and energy savings ; as you know the exhousts of the cars pollute the enviroment , and also in todays economy the oil prices are raising day by day , and i am sure that future 's biggest problem would be the the oil and pollution problems so people would like to use bicycles to save money and try to live healtier .i agree that advertisements today really try to drag you in their product with fake pictures .
[non-native] generally we buy an economic product because we think that it must have the same effect than one expensive , but i think that there is a reason if one is cheapper than another , and this reason is not only connected to the fact that one bring an important name , and another not .
[non-native] young people enjoy themselves with the major stupid thinks , for example i have a brother that is 20 years old and he with him frinds laught for all thinks , they enjoy with videogames , they spend all day play football or gooing away .
[native] > taxation is normally the purview of individual memberstates > the eu has a formal oversight role in matters of taxation ; one of the areas it specifically oversees is whether or not businesses in one country get an unfair tax advantage over those in other countries .
[non-native] to conclude , cars are a important tools of our life , you can use it for a lot of reason such as for going to work , to go to see people , to go to buy something while the public transportation is time over , you can use it to put things that you can not take if you have not car like a big television .
[native] [ this is the book i picked this up all from ] ( http://www.amazon.com/adventure-english-biography-language/dp/1611450071/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=utf8&amp;qid=1442924360&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+adventure+of+english+melvyn+bragg ) to briefly summarise though , old english ( i 'm specifically reffering to about the 700 's ) was just like modern german in the sense that smaller/simpler words were compounded together to form more complex ones , i.e.
[native] you apparently regard a country 's membership of ( or treaty with , in this case ) a framework for joint action by european countries as being in the grip of some kind of evil empire , but you do n't see that as maybe just a wee bit `` black and white '' ?
[native] either they are good at their jobs and have good skills ( in which case they will be very employable all round the world ) or they are not good at their jobs and do n't have good skills ( in which case their options are limited anyway ) .
[non-native] few unsatisfied people are presented , but that does not meat we should travel alone with out any experience or knowledg about the places we intend to visit , the guid do .some people aclaim that they prefer to travel alone , while others oppsite it .
[native] i personally favour an eu that remains a loosely bound confederacy with a common market where each of the member states fully controls their respective legal systems , economies , etc. , but where there is a confederate government which keeps an oversight just in case , for instance , a member-state violates human rights ( a role that is fulfilled by the echr ) .
[non-native] as soon as it comes to similar topics which are only associated with the content that you are familiar with , the one who only learned facts will not be able to answer the questions as appropriately as if he had learned the concept and ideas behind the facts .
[native] > `` hey look , bill gates donated another billion to charity and this neighbor of mine did n't even sent 1 million '' are you trying to compare the wealth difference between bill gates and your neighbour , with the wealth difference between britain , france and germany ?
[native] well everyone left of her is even more unpalatable to anyone wanting to stop the migrants and the only ones right of her are the nazi party and the nazi party lite / protest vote who thinks they are n't voting for the nazi party , so she still has a good chance .
[non-native] no one ca n't be susseed without them what i told .in this essay i 'm going to write about my opinion in the best way to travel is in a group leader by a tour guide , and i think that this is the best way to travel because when you travel alone to a city you dont know very well or it 's the first time for you there you do n't places in the city as a tour guide .
[non-native] however , i ' sure that nothing will ever been as perfect as the car .when it comes to the statement of whether a people sucessul due to the perosn use their knowledge to knew how to do to well or his succeed due to he or she prefer try new things , difficutt people may state various of vews .
[non-native] again this might lead to decrease in number of cars in twenty years .in the modern economy , characterized by the progressive saturization of the markets in each business area , it becomes more and more strategic for farms the use of advertising through the mass media ( television in particular ) .
[non-native] i believe that history is is closely related with facts but those facts are always related with the historian 's point of view , tour guides as every person who knows about history imply their opinion on their explenations and by listening only to one person will limitate us to create our own judgement .
[non-native] in sum i think that sucess acts as a driving force making a person want more and more and a successful person has tha advantage of having more support and resource so he can take more risks to achieve more .i totally agree with the above statement that says `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' because younger people can be much more active than older people .
[native] like most people , i struggle to make sense out of all the chaos in europe right now but it does seem fair to me that we ( germany ) should help out greece or other countries , given that we make major major cash off of being in this union .
[non-native] in conclusion , i strongly agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , because the objective of the advertisement is to sell you something and make you buy it , even if its as good as it seems , or not .today , it is enough for a lot of students to learn facts about certain issues and topics only .
[native] the disaster clearly must have been the origin of the atlantis myth [ recounted by plato in critias ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/atlantis#critias ) ( it was also recorded in chinese history [ as a time of famine ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/minoan_eruption#chinese_records ) ) it was one of the biggest events in ancient history .
[non-native] the busses and trains are a possible alternative in the big cities but in the rural areas there is no such thing like trains running every ten minutes , one has to wait approximatly two hours or more to get a train or bus and the busses are traveling much slower than the cars .
[native] for instance , a lot of different countries , who speak various languages , will each , individually , send a small number of professionals to spain , which means that the eu work force in spain , as well as everywhere else , will be vary diverse as far as origins are concerned .
[native] for example , in the us the media has completely blocked out news about the 3 secret ftas and obamacare ( one way privatization ) has been hyped as being a `` stepping stone to single payer '' ( google that phrase ) here is an example of what i mean - this is a really shameless lie !
[non-native] for example , the idea of selling wrist bands , which have become a style statement , worth rupees ten for twenty five and using the profits for the rehabilitaion of aids affected shows the innovation and also the response with which the youth has accepted the idea .
[non-native] it is the duty of the parents in the home to develop the students attitude to understand the ideas and concepts of their culture and tradition well , without stating the facts , the rules of their culture and it is their responsibility to check that his son or daughter is able to understand their culture are they are able to implement them correct are not .
[native] basically , * the fact that bottled water is already sold * ( or if anybody has been charged for water in any other way ) in ireland means that it could not be seen as exempted as the definition of services supplied ` in the exercise of governmental authority ' requires them to be supplied ( a ) not on a commercial basis , and ( b ) not in competition with any other service supplier .
[native] and yeah , you stalking me gets pretty tiresome , but since you enjoy it so much i decided to shoot off quick replies to you in the post that you linked so you can continue having your fun , as you 're doing here .
[non-native] future society will consist of people who are young now , and because of this it is important to now things enrolled in politics or in other points of view of our societyi disagree with the points made above that having knowledge of all the things is better compared to having the knowledge of one specific field .
[native] the fact that you can change textures , ui , physics or any other variables through dll injection is nothing new , and if it 's the only way , it 's extremely restrictive in what you can do with it , and that 's what the `` circlejerk '' was about .
[non-native] because of that the car companies are investing money in evolute new green technologies like hidrogen batteries that will make possible to use a car without polutting , in fact you will creat just water instead of dioxide carbon that is really harmfull for our enviroment .
[native] [ here 's a good article ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/mar/21/student-fees-policy-costing-more ) about how , due to the terms of the loans and the number of write-offs as a result , the new system of 9k per year is actually likely costing the taxpayer more than when it was 3k per year .
[native] > cooperation within eu to divide through europe well the eu is meant to be about common economic/trade policies , stepping into the realm of refugee resettlement and who gets to live/migrant into a country are a pretty giant overstep that they do n't have the democratic mandate for .
[non-native] for example , the american depression , the stock market crashed in wallstreet , to understand why this happened or why what caused the crash you must have some knowledge of business because the subject revolves around your understanding to businesses and hire purchase ect .
[native] if you fail to even consider the arguments of the people who are speaking up against this power grab and why , you are not a scientist nor do you deserve to be claiming some authority status based on theses which you have not made available for reading .
[native] the people that come here by boat are illegally coming here and so are disregarding our laws , so they have the right to suffer the consequences of such laws , which unfortunately is a bit inhumane , but that is what happens when you queue jump and disrespect our country like that .
[non-native] it is young people have the chance to obtain more beautiful future and create new life .in general i would not agree on the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
[native] this whole thing is a business step 1 . educate yourselves and others about how politics works , forget left/right bullshit , go study some roman history for starters ... step 2 . replace our governments and remove politicians and political parties , introduce a national/federal panarchy via a corporal government that upholds an obvious humanist constitution and mutual accords/contracts/agreements , allow individual people and communities to dictate their own economic policies .
[non-native] i completely agreed with the given statement , which stated as `` it is more important to understand than it is for them to learn facts '' . understanding of concepts are defined by getting the information that how it is intriduced , generated and developed .
[non-native] in conclusion , it is important for every young person to know that giving enough time to help your community is not something to take for granted ; a wise man once said `` if you have no past you have no feature '' ; so you must help your community .advertisements are one of the essential part of todays life , it is difficult not to see an advirtesement in every part of uur lifes .
[non-native] it is a fact that we all want to do things that we know well rather than trying something new as it envolves less risk and the chances of failure are reduced but to achieve something extraordinary we are required to take chances in our life .
[native] will self , who i used to respect , peter carey , emmanuel todd , francine prose and medhi hasan all took the opportunity to condemn ch 's staff and while most of these people were careful not to directly praise the attackers , they all expressed an inordinate amount of sympathy with their aims .
[native] i just find that 90 % of / r/tia 's victims are female ... and while focus of the attack is n't necessarily the fact that it 's female target , it can still bring out some pretty nasty intolerant anti-equality sentiments which unfortunately seem to be popular opinion .
[native] there are parts where some of it is true but for the most part the us south is very diverse and people have been living with this diversity since civil rights back in the '60s without , for the most part , much issue .
[non-native] to sum up understand ideas and concepts are as important as learn facts because it not ban you of having a different vision and opinion of things , and it allows you to create your own personnality .this statement is true to every single word and at the same time equally convincing .
[non-native] however old you may be , however scarce you can be , you can always learn the ways to enjoy your life according to the circumstancesin our world , everything can be sell , from a coke , a chair and alcoholic drinks , to security services , hair brushers and even medicines .
[native] at first i was pretty skeptical , then i looked into it and i could n't find anything saying it was lowest in the world but food prices are , on average , 26 percent lower in germany than the us which is certainly interesting .
[native] i think this argument makes sense only if lebanon would provide refugees with the same freedoms and rights eu countries provide : right to work , education ( trade school or university ) , quality housing ( not tents ) , high quality medical care .
[native] seems to me that all of the diaspora could really mess things up for the status quo ( which the corrupt in power seem to like ) - italy strikes me as being a lot like mexico in that there 's an almost permanent class of people at the top who are not removable by any known means and the gap between them and the lower classes is huge .
[non-native] if you can help them , you will impress them and they will realize you are a person with a good education ; if you can not help them , they will understand you because they know you are not a specialist and you are not supposed to know everything .this essay will examine the question of whether or not most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
[native] why i support these strong trade liberalization views is similar to the ones that i 'm a paying member of the greens ; i 'm aware that in the short run , transitions away from fossil fuels will be difficult and costly - but in the long run , we 'll win out .
[non-native] it is wise to take into account one 's personality , familiarity with the place being travelled to with respect to culture and cost considerations while determining the best way to travel .a broad knowledge of many academic subjects surely has many good aspects .
[non-native] with all these success figures that focusing only on their field of work , we can conclude that in order to run , first you have to walk and taking a severe risk can make you fall , like a stone on your way .when we turn on a t.v. we always see advertisements which looks good and useful to us .
[non-native] there are a lot of successfull people who reach the success only doing what thay already know how to do well , without doing innovation or taking risk : they are common people who do very well their job making a lot of money .
[non-native] for example now days a social worker is not only interested in dealing with the people of only its community but rather people of everywhere no matter if they are racially different or social status of these people differ the basic purpose is just to serve .
[non-native] as a matter of a conclusion , in the future there will be fewer cars because people will try to travell in a fastest and confortable way than in a car and also be concerning about helping and not contaminating the environment .i think that this is a generalization of the young word , and so i think that it is not a true statement .
[native] it should also re-adopt gentile 's actual idealism , while distancing it from mussolini and fascism , and re-invigorate it as a national philosophy to combat catholicism , capitalism , communism and most importantly form a middle ground between conservatism and progressivism , traditionalism and futurism etc.
[native] it 's all a race to the bottom as far as neoliberalism goes ; within the uk 's territories there are many , many tax havens - the netherlands and luxembourg also have some sort of tax haven status , and there are places in the us that are also tax havens .
[non-native] for example , if you just memorize `` 1 + 1 = 2 , 1 + 2 = 3 , 1 + 3 = 4 ... `` but do n't know really understand the concept of the rule of addition , next time i give you a question `` 1 + 100 = ? '' , you still do n't know how to do it .
[native] well armenians have been living in karabakh for centuries , while the turkish settlers ( not actual turkish cypriots who also have been living in cyprus for centuries and speak their own distinct dialect of turkish ) were brought and invited there by turkey to change the demographics of the island , which is by the way a violation of article 49 of the fourth geneva convention : > the occupying power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies .
[native] and you along with much of europe seem to have have this weird collective amnesia of your people 's history with this religion which seems to have not changed much if at all in the last 1400 years when it was created by a warlord-merchant and his tribe .
[non-native] young people choose playing computer games or surfing on the internet inspite of helping their mother in the kitchen and giving enough time to helping their commutinies .i agree that the young people in nowadays do not give enough time to help their communities .
[non-native] the temperature on earth is increased a very spped and if we will to left on this planet for a lot of years now we starts to controlled and save the enviroment for example making a lot of natural reserved on the land an under the see because if the healt of uor planet is n't good we will not life amoung on this earth .
[non-native] as i said in the beginning this might not be the correct way for everybody , but with my personal goals it certainly is for me .it is important for student to understand ideas and concept than it is for them to learn the facts , i agree with this that students should understand the ideas of the concept .
[native] and this is not `` discussion '' on any level , it 's just plain informing `` another game is cracked '' , and there is absolutely no reason to inform about that by now other than `` hey look , you can pirate this now , enjoy !
[non-native] though our culture and texts are filled with lectures on group-functioning and team-work and social upliftment but seemingly it is very distressing to see that the kind of tools that the modern world has provided to this generation are making them divulge of their own duties .
[native] the company most likely will shut down with the patent ( and possibly the people depending how the sale went down ) are moved to the usa and that is the end of that company , and it was never given a chance to grow and be huge .
[non-native] the youngster is a period olife when we discover all around us , the adventure : it s then the moment to discoverall surrounding us with love , to have the first touch to the nature with e power of the maturate senses , mussles .
[non-native] even if the public transport will be presumably enhanced , most of the people will still need a car because the main commercial areas such as shopping centers , cinemas and other facilities will be located far away off the cities and they will still require a car in order to be reached .
[native] it 's basically an enforcement mechanism for treaties to protect investors against regulatory abuses by a government , as well as a way to de-escalate disputes from the state-state level ( where much more damage can be done to * both * sides ) to the investor-state level .
[native] it 's the closed off scandinavian societies where , if you live in a big city where most immigrants go , do n't speak to their neighbours , do n't know their names , and assume that ` society ' or ` the government ' will integrate immigrants , as if it happens by osmosis .
[native] the member state governments have overwhelming control of the eu thanks to the council of ministers and the european council , and whilst politicians will always be politicians , the fact that the eu needs this to be popular amongst the public is why i think they wo n't sell us down the river .
[native] with the uk about to be split and their 2 % nato requirement spending about to be cut ( or at least very reduced ) from the process , at this rate we will be stuck in the endless military loop that is europe forever .
[native] however , many many things which many have come to associate with governments like public education , and in some countries , health care , are framed as commodities and as `` market access barriers '' or `` trade barriers '' making it clear that they are not seen as a public good or as essential by the ftas .
[native] i honestly ca n't recall a single time in australian media where i hear about the rich gulf nations and their take on the ` refugee crisis ' , but we quite frequently here about the european perspective , and also australia 's regional partners in the issue ( cambodia , indonesia , singapore ... etc ) .
[non-native] but the factor that makes me really valueable for my employer , for example , is the individual , very precise knowledge i have on a certain field , which i can , of course , integrate in greater circumstances by my basic knowledge of the subject i 'm working on .
[native] well , we did n't waste a moment in getting out our phones , sneaking to the tuckshop , goofing off - all very quietly , of course , since we did n't want her to wake up , or a teacher from the next classroom to come in .
[non-native] even though i admit that there could be more chances to find the things one is good at if she always takes a risk of trying , once one finds the thing to work on , there is no more need for one to find another one .
[non-native] the world is developing and person is developing , people is developing , so the society does n't want the people that good for everything , which means the major knowledge is more important , which means we need to be good for one major thing .
[non-native] even though the increase in the comertial fuel prices might deter the people from using cars , of late we have seen a concious effort made by the govetnments in varios countries to use natural fuels like bio-diesel which would mean that thefuprice will be taken care of .
[native] the funny thing is , if they were really refugees , really fleeing immediate conflict in the last country they were escaping from and need a place to stay temporarily , then a refugee camp is the proper short-term solution to this short-term problem .
[native] furthermore , rules regulating subsidization for manufacturing are very solidly built already under wto architecture , however the rules for agriculture are much more up in the air ( and with the failure to address agriculture in the latest doha agreement , it 's only going to be more murky in the future ) .
[non-native] being an individual member of this society , but still seen as someone special because of his achivements , the successful man ( or woman ) tries to stay on top , proving to himself and the mass that he could achieve everything , being someone special .
[native] they refer to defence costs in isds as ` substantial ' even if the state wins , despite the fact that the average isds case costs [ 8 million dollars ] ( http://www.oecd.org/daf/inv/investment-policy/isdsprogressreport.pdf ) ( p. 8 ) , and that eu proposals for isds include provisions that [ the loser pays the legal costs ] ( http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2013/november/tradoc_151916.pdf ) .
[native] additionally , i 'd like to get the point across that it is extremely likely that we could have english as a european second language , which everybody learns and knows , whilst the various regional ( national ) languages still exist and are used .
[native] by being divided for almost 1400 years in a plethora of small piece of lands who declared war at each other every once in a while and at the same time used to get regularly fucked left and right by frenchmen , austrians and spaniards ?
[non-native] for example , my mother is working as an accountant and when she met her friend veronica , who works in the stock , she encourage her to invest her money in the stock because she says that it will double or even triple her money .
[non-native] so i 'm not agree with this statement , we will still have a car but we will not use it very often , so one car will probably be enough for a family .some people think hat in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today , while others do n't have this point of view , and i agree with the latter for three reasons : variety of functions of the cars , difficulty to reach a lot of places , and amusement of driving .
[native] the best realistic course of action i believe would be un peacekeeping with kurdistan as protectorate , and perhaps if willing to negotiate , the offer of peace to is if they allow peacekeepers to supervise the creation of the caliphate , establishment of its borders , and ensuring cultural minorities are n't subjected to ethnic cleansing .
[non-native] i seriously belief that if we do not begin to rebalance the values of our society we will live in a very corrupted world in which the most difficult thing it will be simly to live in !i disargee with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people .
[native] what i was saying is that that telling the type of people who are already at the point of blatantly sexually assaulting someone in public `` the rules '' is not an effective approach to their behaviour , they 're way past that point .
[non-native] knowing when to attack , when to defend , and when to fortfeit is what makes a person succesful ; it is what guarantees the samurai 's victory .i can agree to this statement but of course this does not mean that there are no people that spend time - or enough time - to helping .
[non-native] by enjoying their life , they can get variety of knowlede , experiences , and moral and then they grow up to adaluts .now adays most of the people are trying new things without taking risk , in my opinion it 's a wrong thing , 1st of all when we are going to try something new we should ask about it , specially we should ask the pirson who tried this thing , 2nd the successful people try new things and take risks , i want to tell something from my own experiences , i have a cousin & he want to buy a new car and i warned him ' i told him this car is not good it 's spending petrol & it 's not fast car also it 's expensive car , he told that i do n't believe you & i will buy this car , i told him it 's up to you , after one month he came for me & he told you that i was right when i told him not to buy that car , also that i have i friend & he want to marrie one girl in the university i told him that i know this girl & she 's always preparing date with a other men , he told me that you are jaleous , i told him ok do what ever you want , after 6 months he came & told you are right , i heared her voice talking with another guy & i was shocked , so i think we should ask the people who have experiences before we try anything new , it 's better for us , from now on we should learn to ask the people about something we want to try it i think it 's not a shame to ask question , i ve got a lesson from my cousin & my friend , that 's u should't try new thing before asking the old person or the person who have an experiencesi agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
[native] `` we do n't want foreign people coming here and stealing jobs '' , ignoring people like me who plan to go abroad , or kirsten farage , and `` immigrants ruin everything , they do n't integrate and make life shit for the local people '' whilst sat on the costa del sol reading the daily mail with a fry-up .
[non-native] as far as i am concerned and as being a student for a considerable amount of my life-time ; i am a proponent of the practical approach and think that schools must pay attention to teach ideas and concepts and should provide each student a broad vision to comprehend them throughly .
[non-native] in short , i strongly agree with the idea that young generation nowadays do not give time to helping their communities because they only focus on preparing their future life and are not educated by adults about helping communities .throughtout my life i have always try to do the most to have great marks on all the courses i have ever took and all my experiences have showed me how important is to understant ideas and concepts while i am studing .
[non-native] in conclusion the advertisements play a big situation to sell products in the market .as far as i am concerned , i belive that understanding one onother is a priority so pay more attention to ideas and concept would be an excellent opportunity to augment one 's own personality and also widen your personal horizons .
[native] i ca n't claim to know the details of the discussion , but could it not be possible he was rather saying he could n't judge people from that culture ( after all , they do n't know any different , this is the system they grew up and were raised in and are thh fundamental building blocks of them as a social person ) , rather than that culture itself ?
[non-native] clealy , having vast knowledge of many kinds of academic subject is more good for the person 's future .many people think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specializw in one specific subject while other people do n't .
[non-native] thats why i don ; t think that it 's a good ideia to take risk in some thing that you do n't know , i know that i do n't have knoledg enogh to give these successful men an advise but please listen to me if you are succese in your jop stay one it to have a beter life to live with your family if you have one .
[non-native] concerning the first argument , there is no doubt that a lot of students today , maybe stressed by the exams and by the fixation to obtain the best grades , tend to learn a subject even without understanding it untill the end , i mean , without going behind the words and the mere facts .
[non-native] most of the advertisements use that beaty standart to show their products , most of the model are really different to the real average person and when you see a fashion catalogue and try to buy the same clothes for your `` normal size '' it does not look as good in you because you bought just an ideal not a really image .
[native] let me quote the * very next line of that article * , before yet another russian poster feels he can make a vague reference to this report and convince everyone russia 's hands were clean in georgia : > however , the attack followed months of provocation , and both sides violated international law , the report said .
[native] tl ; dr - not all of the web is sticky , most have tiny hairs on their legs that are the only part to make contact with the web so contact area is minimized , many spiders are hairy all over for the same reason ( among other reasons ) , and some have tiny blobs of glue on the strands of the web that they can avoid when running along it .
[native] i know - my homeland of wessex was invaded by the normans and broken up - i get into heated arguments all the time , and i spit at every sign saying `` dorset '' when i do n't have the time to vandalise it .
[non-native] another reason why the claim about advertisements and their misleading status does n't hold is that most ads do not actually inform about the products , but that they rather encompass certain images and emotions which are associated with the product they are trying to sell .
[non-native] to sum up , old people enjoy life more than young people because they have more life exprience , more time , more money and they know the meansadvertisements nowadays are as important to the firm that makes it as the final product they are sellin to us .
[native] i mean , you ca n't even contain yourself to the rules of a message board , yet you believe onlookers are not only going to believe you can manage to control yourself in society , but are also experts on tens of thousands of others ?
[native] the ottomans had a huge influence on the contemporary culture of the balkans which still lasts to this day , and the architecture and culture of southern spain still retains influence from the the resistance movements in the balkans and in iberia were inevitable , because both islamic empires were ruled by non europeans and had a culture that clashed with european customs and norms .
[non-native] i do n't believe making the products look better is neccessarily bad unless they present true information , because it is the whole point of advertisement and competition between brands to earn more money .i disagree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
[non-native] consquently , i agree the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .there have been a lot of events from the past in korea : the korean war , the invasion from japan , many political incidents , and so on .
[native] i think * ostensibly * americans and canadians are very similar , but then germans , brits , francs , spaniards , and poles are all * ostensibly * very different , but polling has actually indicated that culturally our attitudes towards things are quite similar .
[non-native] but i think that the advantages of learning concepts and ideas much overweight the advantages of learning facts in general .i think that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because when you learn a fact you do n't have any explication about what you learn you just have to believe and everybody have the same opinion about it
[non-native] then , from there , we can be more than just a walking dictionary .first of all \ i think to be achcive what we want we shoulld take risk / for example there are some people who are succesful and did good and useful thins in the past took risk / if everybody does what they know how new things are discovered / in the past / some people tried new things and by means of these things our life is easier/for instance / one of the well known scientist who tried 2000 things when tried to discover what he want to
[non-native] the young people of today do n't understand that they could make a big difference just by helping their community , for example they could organise a fund raiser , but it does n't have to be big , they could just donate some money to the country that is in poverty , or help thier mum or dad in the kitchen .
[non-native] the companies can-t be free of telling lies to the customer , beside this he must = e protected by the law .i clearly disagree with the statement that `` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' .
[non-native] so the more and more there is people who just belive in whatever they can see in a tv commercial , and what is more , if your favorite tv star is wearing this amazing product you always wanted to belong , then there is definitely no reason to doubt about the fact you have to buy that product .
[non-native] an example that comes to my mind is the current debate about bioethics : for the society as a whole it is much more important that we have wellrounded people capable of understanding and debating about the social consequences of human clonation , rather than some scientists that develope the technical method to make it possible .
[non-native] these people can withstand for any type of result that may give profit or loss , but the person who is in loss will never try to do risks as the reason that he may face loss if the plan gives negative result which leads the person to huge ammount of loss .
[native] * national has advanced intrusive state surveillance and has allied itself with the usa 's global spying regime -- with continued advances in technology and the reliance our children have on this technology , it scares me that they will only ever know a world where there is the constant assumption that they will be tracked and spied upon .
[native] however , judging by its response ( and how long it took it to make one to begin with ) to russia 's annexation of another country 's land , i really do n't think eu has as much power as you attribute to it .
[native] > so while you may have your opinion , you should acknowledge that the commerce world and the attention of users does n't work at all like you just said it did and you 'd do better to educate yourself if you care about the topic .
[native] if you go around saying ` the holocaust was n't real , jews deserve to be killed ' in a * public place * which is what it essentially was , you have every reason to be expected to be called out on it .
[non-native] for example , according a research , 80 % of korean junior high school students answer that they are not happy to the question '' are you happy ? '' because they get tons of stresses from study and feel nervous about their futures .
[native] in western europe people still generally pick me for australasian but in some other places i have found that people try about 3 other languages before finally asking if i have any english , whereas my american counterparts get spoken to in english straight off the bat .
[native] > when people connected to the hotspot , the terms and conditions they were asked to sign up to included a `` herod clause '' promising free wi-fi but only if `` the recipient agreed to assign their first born child to us for the duration of eternity '' .
[non-native] so , from the several reasons and examples we can conclude that its better to have broad knoledge in one subject .as far as trying new things and take risks is concerned , it is really difficult to do something you do not know but you can say you are really brave when you have tried doing as much as you can .
[non-native] i also think that there is a kind of new definition of community for young people : for them this word represents people around them directly , and , for example , many students prefer to have activities in the different associations of their university rather than to do something for the council for example .
[native] it 's a fact that the imminent tisa and ttip ftas * set up privatization as the goal for all public services * of member nations , ( by default , unless carved out , as for example , the french carved out their audiovisual services ) that do not fall into the extremely narrow gats exceptions .
[non-native] in conclusion , younger people will enjoy more their life than older people do , because they have less things to care about and does not know how hard the world is to live as a human beings .specifically the topic refers to a very pressing problem in todays time .
[non-native] but it is quite obvious too that , if we do not discover anothers technologies , the number of cars in a family will decrease because of the negative impact , of the price of the oil , on the budget of families .`` it is all about the club , makes your shot have a lifetime expirience '' ( wilson golf clubs ) this was an advertisment for a golf club about five years ago .
[native] there are doc ( department of conservation ) campsites all across the country which are n't too pricey at all ( i think last time i did it , i pitched a tent for nz$ 10 a night ) , although they can get mad busy in the summer .
[native] make france look weak and dodgy in the defence industry and prevent russia from getting a warship also i do n't know where you got the idea that the uk has a blue water navy , at the very minimum you need an aircraft carrier with planes .
[non-native] according me yes may be we wont be able to see small cars like santro , zen etc during that time definately indian economy would have raised n people instead of using small cars would prefer to use big cars like benz or posh .
[non-native] certain advertising campaings , are designed to catch te customer attention in a way that is not ethically accepted for every one , and this is the case of the use of hided messages that goes directly to the subconcious mind of the customer , that he or she can not perceive .
[non-native] in conclusion , i strongly agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .i agree that successful people try news things and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well , for these reasons ; by trying new things allow you to be curious to know how someone did it and you will find out how to do it too , that way it make you make a research .
[native] for a long time the obama administration thought that medvedev was a `` second in command '' and attempted to work directly with him , perhaps to give him some legitimacy in the eyes of the russian people , but the putin regime just took this as a sign of how badly the us did n't `` get it '' .
[native] and that 's not even getting started on their non-racial ideological ** bullshit ** , all of their science , climate , and rights records are so abysmal that if all their supporters dropped dead this moment i would n't shed a single fucking tear when i awake the next morning to find the collective iq of the human race has gone up radically and problems might actually start getting solved .
[native] his full statement : '' `` one of the interpretations as to what this means is that towards the end of time there will be many wars like what we are seeing today , and because of these wars women will be taken as captives , as slaves , yeah , women will be taken as slaves .
[native] in addition , the us spends about double per capita as the eu on defence , so it 's much easier for them so subsidize more companies through wasteful defence procurement , than in the eu where companies like bae , saab , and so on compete heavily between nations .
[native] obviously there are some ( significant ) teething problems currently at hand with the muslim population , such as the sharp rise in antisemitism you mention , but i 've found that so much in life is ridiculously complex and difficult to make meaningful impact on .
[native] edit : `` in 2017 , approximately 20 % of the canadian population might belong to a visible minority group '' this is stated right below the last stat i listed , so it seems the foreign born population is just as high as the visible minority group .
[native] as such , there 's no reason to oppose the eu on the basis of something that might never happen , and which , if it does ever happen , will happen only because it 's desirable or acceptable to the majority of europe 's people .
[native] it was different from the system we use though , and represented an older dialect of japanese ( for example everything spelled `` h '' now used to be pronounced `` f '' , and `` dz '' was different from `` z '' )
[non-native] cars might be in a different structure to keep up with the technology and might have new gadgets but the illimination of cars it quit hard for the past century god bless henry fords heart we have depened on cars and as long as i have been alive cars was the only mean of daily transpotration and to me the safest transportation .
[native] merlin was much pleased with this homely repast and the kindness of the ploughman and his wife ; but he could not help seeing that though everything was neat and comfortable in the cottage , they seemed both be sad and much cast down .
[native] > but i do n't understand why does uk want the strong reaction instead of trying to difuse the problem like the rest of western europe with symbolic measures and considerate words the time for symbolic measures and considerate words has , unfortunately , passed .

[non-native] advertisements make everything that the trip sounds perfektly and the price is also okay so people book the trip and when you go there you see the realities about the hotel or the location or what ever , which is not true with the advertisement .
[non-native] but i also believe that if you do what you know how to do well , you can have a normal and nice life , with some good aspects but also with some problems , instead if you want to become a successful man , the only thing that you can do is to try an original job or a new trend , because in this era only if you are a creative person you can found success and easy money .
[non-native] a young man , for example , could leave his studies , dip into a job and earn his bit for a while , since he may be single and not loaded with worldly responsibilities or that his partner and he have the capacity to work it out so that both of them can have some fun .
[non-native] but i do n't think this will happen as scientists are working on prepring biofuel which will cost less and will last for greater time and i have a good example of this study as some of my friends prepared biofuel from jatropha plant and with the help of this fuel they ran an engine .
[native] some disadvantages : there is democratic deficit at european level politics , the best solution to this problem would be to move to a fully federal system which i suspect is what the eurosceptics europe wide are afraid off and all the square banana and health & safety scare stories are really about drumming up opposition to the eu for this reason .
[native] ** as a citizen compelled to follow the laws imposed by society , i am freer than a wild animal because the same society has given me rationality , freedom from the power imbalance seen in the natural world , and thanks to the efficiency of co-operation , it has freed up vast amounts of time for me to spend pursuing my interests .
[native] now , if you look at the / r/europe survey , first question under the ` politics ' topic titled `` my feelings towards the european union are ... '' https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1wdxb3lwqtfcbsowwmse5vnnkzqwtcsx3vy0a068zxo8/viewanalytics#start=publishanalytics you can see that 66 % of respondents had either positive or very positive feelings towards the european union ( compared to the european average of 31 % ) , 16 % said they were neutral ( compared with 39 % ) , and only 18 % said they had a negative or very negative view of the european union ( compared with 28 % ) .
[non-native] secondly , most of the tour travels let you a day free or an afternoon free for personal activities , and if you are traveling with a tour guide , is that , he can recommends you places or things to do in that free time depending on your interest , so that you can make even more things .
[non-native] thus , the education authority should formulate a policy to demonstrate the young generations the advantages of living in a well developed communities and to educate them that it 's not only obligation but also a morale of being a member of a community .
[non-native] therefore , to anunce that a product have many advantages than others such as heathy food , which is a popular subjet now , can convice people to buy and really spread the information to their family and friends , so finaly everybody belive in it .
[non-native] on the one hand , dividing your attention in between lots of different subjects , you do not run the danger of becoming a narrow-minded academic completely endorsed in their own field of study as you interact with many different points of view and opinions .
[native] at the moment there does n't seem to be a big group inside of the eu who even bother to try and sway public opinion in the uk , i 'd like us to stay but when the only side that is getting its message out properly is the one that supports leaving then it 's getting harder to see that happening .
[native] *** but the use of the draft 's unamended wording in the final ceta treaty - before the results of the public consultation have even been analysed - show that it was little more than a pr stunt , according to kenneth haar , a spokesman for corporate europe observatory .
[non-native] furthermore , if we take this subject again to the college environment , we will see that the concept of having first a broad knowledge to later specialize it is implied on the normal carreer path ; a person starts with a broad degree , lets say for example industrial engieneering , then after some good exposure to the work environment and experimenting with his/her preferences , that person will pick a subject for a masters like manufacturing , then after more knowledge and practical exposure have been accomplished it is possible to go through a phd program which is even a more specialized vision of that particular path , in the case of our example manufacture of polymers research .
[native] he was recently described as [ literally too stupid to argue with ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1o93hf/would_you_support_bosnia_in_the_eu/ccqpxc0?context=1 ) , and has an annoying habit of ignoring every argument you make , every objective fact and figure , coming up with his own most surreal and bizarre arguments , and with mind numbing patience repeating the same shit over and over until you give up .
[non-native] even if they want to go somewhere they will not be allowed to go alone since they will be stopped by their children , daughter-in-law etc. and they need to have somebody with them and it may not be very practical since young people dont like going out with old people .
[non-native] therefore he could have a good curriculum in comparison with people that don-t have experience .some people in japan , where i live , the life old people has is more enjoyable , but i think young people enjoy life more than old people for the following reasons .
[non-native] having the possibility to have more lifes i would surely try both approaches , attending specializing courses and lessons on a subject or few of them , then trying to find my way through , also having a broad knowledge of many acadamic subjects .
[native] if americans have really turned into that which you 're representing . . than not only will i return to germany , but i 'll start agreeing with europeans when they talk smack about americans instead of defending the us ( and ` americans ' ) at every turn - as i have this whole time .
[native] and all of them spend a higher % of their gdp towards their military than ireland does , and if most people were to be asked `` who would win in a war '' , in quite a few of those cases i 'd doubt people would say ireland .
[non-native] lastly , if you want to learn some thing then it always need an extra afferts and need logic behind that , if you clear this stage then no one in the world , are able to wash your memory .although some successful people prefer doing what they already know how to do well , i prefer to try new things and take risiks .
[native] if you want to know about rampant pedophilia by elites in dominican republic you need to look at 2 investigate reporters that are not too swampy ... one is alicia ortega and the other is nuria piera , nuria is dominican republic 's alex jones . . she 's always fucking up corrupt politicians and they fear her ... she 's also a ratings machine since the 80s and the people respect her opinion too much to be silenced or murdered although assassination attempts have been made . . alicia ortega is newer in the investigative journalism and is more msm and swampy . . nuria 's office is an investigate one , not a tv producing one . . people with no resources go to her for help in investigating crimes the police wo n't touch either due to corruption or incompetence . .
[non-native] on the other hand , people may have good reasons to not take risks and to not experience new things , such as family , studies an other thing that may be much important that have a successful life .i agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
[non-native] i 'm sure that some day there is not gonna be more space for this cars but i am also pretty sure that people are not gonna care for this , instead they are going to develop new ways to store them but never get rid of them .
[native] and i 'm more than happy to admit that i 'm arrogant , however if you spoke with the vast majority of people on / r/europe you 'd find that they tend to be complete dunces when it comes to how the cap works .
[non-native] instead , if you just concentrate on facts , like sequences of events , dates or other `` useless '' information , you may be able to remember them for a certain period of time , but definitely not as long as you live .
[native] it 's weird , i was down that way a few weeks ago for a wedding , and as you say when we changed trains at cardiff it was absolutely miserable and i had some foreboding about the planned beach celebrations , yet further out westwards it was absolutely glorious weather .
[native] britain * currently * holds the biggest financial exchange in the world , but we are dealing with a future where china is invested in expanding it 's own exchange in shanghai , and there are other centres to deal with if uk or the fragmented nations of europe do n't oblige china 's whims .
[native] if there is a clash of civilisations , it is one-sided - the mainstream culture is rejecting islamic immigrants , which creates the problems the mainstream culture then complains about as supposedly `` characteristic '' of the rejected culture , reinforcing their own rejection of them .
[non-native] finally , according to the prementioned factors , older people have less enjoy than young people , and thats clear from the saying ( eat to live or live to eat ) which best illustrate the difference between this two kind of human beings .i disagree with the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .
[non-native] as soon he got a sucess in the article he placed himself in the novels and story books in which he got a tremendous sucess in the sucess he was not only supported by his friends , relatives and by the public also right now he was not only a famous article but also a famous novelist and a story writer .
[non-native] i think there should exist some kind of reagulation that could control the content of the advertisements , so people always can receive what they are looking , in that way there would be less problems of reclamations , and it will be reflected in the reputation of the companys .nowadays we live in a very comppetitive world .
[non-native] older people have learned to enjoy life differently , for instance by building a family or taking care of it , by enjoying every single moment of what we could call happiness .the statement given makes a strong assertion , that we will see fewer cars on the roads twenty years from now .
[non-native] also , the olds know actually about what they want and where they want to go , and their sufficient life experience make them full of intellingece , they could obeserve life insightly , the way the enjoy , for instance , is only a cup of tea , or look the scenery out of the window .
[non-native] it can also be added that because of the bad quality of certain products , some unscrupulous people dare to send these '' rubbish '' to lower developped countries and it is a shameregarding the question of agreeing or disagreeing with the statement that indicates that `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject '' , i would have to disagree .
[non-native] in my opinion , however , i agree that successful people try new things and take risks because new things can stronly appeal to people , they are different from other things , and it is hard to be on the top with the same things .
[non-native] for example the people who invented televisions which are black and white , on the successful inventing that telivision poeple are more intrested in inventing the colouredtelevisions , hence because of the succesful people mind , they tend to invent more and more things which are more better than the previouinventions .
[native] > the fact that refugees do n't want to come to the czech republic , instead of being other member states ' problem , would become the czech republic 's problem -- it would have an incentive to become a ` warmer ' place so , countries that are not attractive to immigrants because they are poor ( see the post on the front page about immigrants ' reason for not coming to romania ) are punished for being poor ?
[native] likewise , i do n't think that henry viii [ hanging , drawing and quartering ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hanged,_drawn_and_quartered ) people was ok . just because i live in a country old enough to have committed some pretty heinous atrocities does n't mean i 'm not in a position to move past that , try and make up for past wrongs , and advocate a better path forwards .
[native] > one morning , accompanied by a huge dog , he was walking on a road which runs along the base of a cliff protected from the sea by a low wall when he met an old french naval captain , with a wooden leg , powerfully built and of peppery temper .
[non-native] primarily , if only a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is given to a student and the students decides not to go for perfection , he would not only end up messing his own life , but also of many others surrounding him .
[non-native] now gettin back to the point of my favouring the notion here stated , the youngsters have every thing at this particular span of time that they are in be it health , looks or entusiasm to do variuos things , the quest to hunt for the unknown mysteries of life that surround them and lay unfolded in front of them .
[non-native] it is extremely difficult to evaluate the products in short period of time while advertisements are on the media , and also because they are indirect way to show the products , consumers just can not get correct impressions of the products from the advertisements .
[non-native] in order to see this point clearly , let me give you an instance : it is show in the advertisement that the price of a kind of product is very lower , however , the price does not contain some kinds of subsitutes .
[native] because nuclear is not something that can set up and dissaembled quickly ( so not short term ) , and because a practical replacement is likely ~ 50-100 years away ( so it 's not a permanent or long-term solution ) that was my thinking anyway .
[native] another few choice quotes ; `` more integration in the eurozone * is inevitable * , when we have a common currency , we need more common policies ... that is the logical consequence of the choice we made many years in the treaty of maastricht '' `` we have overcame the existential threat to the eurozone , i have never said we have overcame already the job crisis and the economic crisis '' `` often we acted a little too late '' `` the message of extremists , this is not helpful at all ...
[native] i 'm also extremely wary of our military-industrial complex ( the `` iron triangle '' as eisenhower put it ) and well aware that its grown far beyond the needs of its intended purpose of protecting its citizenry from threats both foreign and domestic .
[non-native] i want say that someone may learn ideas by facts , or facts by ideas , but it is most important make experiences , so one person have to improve his/her couriosity toward life at the same way with the two instruments ( ideas and facts ) .i agree wit the presented statement .
[non-native] so in the end i think it is always better to understand the idea of what you are learning , because just in that case it is easier for you to use it in your life and it is so much easier to keep it in mind .i agree with the statement .
[native] ah sorry did n't see the edit , no worrys i would have a been a bit annoyed if someone made such a bad comparison as the other guy did insinuating that the usa was going to somehow slowly fall apart ( or quickly depending on the empire ) if he meant the . . uk . . well maybe not because scotland is having a referendum . . but no worries :p
[non-native] even i myself who never joined the commuity activity before do n't know how to get the information and where to look for the area that might need help or even where to start even if i seriously want to engage in a community work .
[native] if germany wants to see the eu integrate , for a common foreign policy to be established & a consolidated military to actually exist , it needs to actually aid france & britain in helping maintain regional stability instead of forcing them to rely on america .
[native] the study and this article put together seem to imply that there 's a great deal of hidden racism in swedish culture ( as opposed to in australian culture where it 's more verbal , but considerably less likely to impact on employment ) which significantly impacts how well foreigners can integrate .
[native] well apparently , `` no acts of war occurred during the conflict , but britain stationed boats in hanö , which had been ** invaded ** though sweden did n't try to hinder nor revoke the occupation as it supported the continued trade . ''
[non-native] there are many possibillities to get a car without earning much money , for exemple by pating step by step or by renting a car - and i think this facts will be increase in the next years and will be much stronger than today .
[non-native] people will start knowing each other and helping each other , and it can also help the young people to do more valueable things than just waste their time on the other things .the growing importance of advertising in today 's society raises the question of the reliability of advertisments knowing that most of them show products in a much better way than they really are .
[native] i find we like to bash on america ( in canada and europe ... and everywhere ) because they do a lot of bad stuff ( iraq ) but many countries in europe really do n't do their fair share when it comes to defence .
[non-native] even if specializing into specifical subjects can maximize how a person will solve a problem , and give an indepth analisys in his own area , if his professional area becomes obsolete by any reason , ( technological means , substitute activities ) they then become obsolete for working in different areas .
[non-native] the education of people not to use cars for short movements or to exploit sharing strategies , and a drastic improvement of public transportation are the most effective solutions i advise .yes i agree with thish statment it is more importet for students to lea understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts when things going on ideas and concepts are understood in my practical reason giving that in any subject when we learn ideas and concepts then we can learn facts about that subject .
[non-native] maybe is necessary get up early in the morning and spend more time across the street , or in the traffic , but in this way you will have the opportunity to spend more time with own family , you can say a fact or an experience of day .
[native] i openly admit canada did some bad stuff in its past and still could do better in its present but i think a lot of people in serbia ( at least from people i know or have met ) do n't want to admit to anything , so long as they feel other countries in the area have n't received an adequate share of blame .
[non-native] well i surely do agree that a successful human being is a person who takes risks in his life , he 's a person who uses all the apportunities he got , bieng riski is one of the most important things to make a career and to be one of the best .
[non-native] in conclusion , the texts and appearence of a product that appear on the advertisment is designed with purpose and intention to a more attractive and dramatic looking but it is usually better than how the product actually are .many students hate to study , because it 's boaring , yet when the students realize the ideas and concepts .
[native] * [ mad men ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0804503/ ) -- ( 2007 ) a drama about one of new york 's most prestigious ad agencies at the beginning of the 1960s , focusing on one of the firm 's most mysterious but extremely talented ad executives , donald draper .
[non-native] as a results , young people do not have enough time to do other activities , and they only concentrate on the subject that will be helpful in their entrance in a good high school , a good university and finally getting a good job .
[non-native] but , in conclusion i think that is better to know many things , to be aware of what life has for each one - you can reach this state when you are an adult , even a young adult - and then enjoy life , knowing the advantages and challenges that life puts on your way to get almost anything : when something costs one a lot of work , it will appear to be better when it is obtained .
[native] i mean , i do remember seeing plenty of hd5000 news once the cards were out , but certainly nowhere near the hype machine they are making for vega ( and that , by the way , make the impression on me that it 's their last shot ) .
[native] i do n't want to sound like i 'm complaining , it 's not like 90 days is n't pretty generous as is , and there are n't that many cases where it matters outside of a gap year style backpacking and old people doing a really really grand tour style thing .
[non-native] as for advertisements , some people like advertisement because they think that advertisements can tell them about the new products and they can learn quickly aobut the new product from the advertisement and then they believe the advertisements ; while others do n't like the avdertisements and they think that the companies alway boast the founction of the new products and naturally they think that the products seem much better that they really are .
[native] this could be why she could n't go to the uk if that is what the deleted comment alluded to - * paragraph 15 of the immigration rules states that the united kingdom , the channel islands , the isle of man and the republic of ireland collectively form a common travel area .
[non-native] for instance , a sociologist who plans to study the criminal tendency among an specific cultural group must not only have information about the history of these people , but must also have an adequate amount of knowledge about how economic conditions which might influence human behaviour should be interpreted .
[native] * as the eu consolidates its federal power over the next few decades , english will become the de facto primary language , so the advantage of knowing one of the many different european languages may confer less of an advantage than one might think .
[non-native] thus , in my opinion , a person should follow an approach , whereby broad knowledge of many academic subjects is obtained in undergraduate studies and expert knowledge in one specific subject is obtained in post graduate studies .i agree with the idea that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
[non-native] to conclude , i would say that there is a very close relationship between understanding ideas and learning facts ; none is more important than the other , and when you are sutdying , you need to do both to succeed .in my oppinion products seem better than they actually are in advertisemets , so i agree with the statement .
[native] soldiers awarded german gold cross medal ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nawt73a600 ) i know that it sucks to still have the stigma from nazis and what not , but , taking the above video as context , maybe starting to really help the people of the world will really be that which finally convinces everybody everywhere that these nazi comparisons are just wrong .
[native] * ** the great beauty ** - jep gambardella has seduced his way through the lavish nightlife of rome for decades , but after his 65th birthday and a shock from the past , jep looks past the nightclubs and parties to find a timeless landscape of absurd , exquisite beauty .
[non-native] by understanding the ideas and the concepts one can have the ability to improve his grasping power and the creativeness , because when a student learns only the facts he can just have some information about the topic but he ca n't even know the concept behind it .
[non-native] in conclusion unless we can not find ways to make cars non-hazrdous to environments and work on other sources of energy , the number of cars will likely to decrease with in twenty years due to envorinmental and aconomical issues .did the young generation really forget their dues to their communities ?
[native] germany holds the cards of bailout loans , and yes reforms are needed in southern europe ... but a real central bank is needed for the eurozone ... hell the only reason southern europe is still afloat is because the ecb buys bonds from people that buy southern european goverment bonds .
[native] plus , one of the strongest armies in the world is n't going to go and steam roll an entire country ( that 's part of the country the army belongs to and they do n't want to destroy , the fact i need to point this out is kinda worrying ) , same problem you always have with insurgents , you ca n't use any real amount of military force , and they do n't need to be well equipped in order to cause a lot of damage .
[non-native] if i need some useful information or some optional tours , i will go to travel information center .it is very difficult to think about a situation in the future like this , thus it is impossible to state undoubtly an opinion infact one should only try to imagine a situation .
[non-native] but there is a limite to this because soon or later we wont be thinking ourselves , the people that decides and rules all of the trends , publicity will controle us , will set up what we think is nice or good etc . ..
[non-native] secondly , there is also an ambiental reason that make me think that the number of cars will decrease , the fact that cars pollute air and so are a risk for our health : for this reason i think that governements will not encourage the bought of new cars by taxing them a lot .
[native] as an american of lithuanian heritage and a polonophile , i think nato was correct in accepting the former warsaw pact/ussr states , but it should 've been obvious to everyone that when russia recovered from the shock of the 90s , they would seek to restore russian influence in the russian `` near abroad . ''
[non-native] the children on the other hand are their to prove that the grown ups are more mature , the children do nothing but imature things wich they enjoy , but eventualy they are bownd to learn form the adults , who are more mature , that these enjoyalbe imature acitons are not permited and rong .
[native] i posted up a [ message ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/4pncuc/anyone_here_used_shibehosting/ ) ` bout a week ago asking around , but no luck yet - i just want to find out a bit more about them , so i do n't end up tossing my doge into the void .
[native] * have one commissioner per department * ( which themselves should be reduced to clear out redundancy ) * instead of one from every nation with a portfolio to compensate their position ; have commissioners appointed by the commission president and confirmed by the european senate .
[native] the cta will have to end if the uk leaves the eu , and the result will either be a controlled border between ireland and northern ireland , which will be massively expensive and piss off republicans , or controlled border between the rest of the uk and northern ireland , which will massively piss off the unionists .
[native] these things matter to europeans ... because it effects us ... half of us being in nato as well americans should see how it effects them along with the biggest trading block in the world by gdp will effect them if it tanks ... well i do n't know what to say seeing as we 're negotiating a free trade agreement .
[native] it 'd be politically unacceptable , if you want an idea of how much the electorate dislikes the eu there 's a forth political party dedicated to the issue emerging * in a first past the post system * , something that people would have laughed at you for predicting ten years ago .
[native] i 'm not out to portray a one sided view of the conflict or promote any kind of nationalism , but this blase moral equivalence that some people have towards the causes and responsibilities of wwi is a bit of a bugbear for me .
[native] rather than saying they were not seen as white i would say we were seen as a seperate group within the `` white '' race [ here ] ( http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/files/2008/10/harpers1.gif ) is an example and there are many more where we are shown with pronounced brows/chins and generally more sinister and hairy looking .
[native] i would argue that obviously there are benefits but to learn 5 is going too far with the whole idea , more lessons about computer science and mathematics would be far more useful than learning any more than 3 languages maximum ( including the native language ) .
[non-native] finally , with the resons and examples discussed above i am agree with the statement `` successfull people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' .over the past centuries , pedagogues all over the world have been discussing whether it is more effective for students to understand ideas and concepts or to learn the facts about things .
[native] well sure , it would sound like hick-speak to us at first :) i live in vancouver , which is packed with immigrants from all over the world , so i rub shoulders with people speaking english as a second language every day ( in fact , most of my colleagues ) .
[native] it 's fascinating how the austro-hungarian and ottoman empries which had been so effective at various times in european and in the case of the ottomans in european * and * middle eastern history as polities were so weak by the time of ww1 .
[non-native] and as long you find a common language to use with them - even a sign language - they 'll take places not included in the most popular lists , but sure to make your experience a lot more authentic and enjoyable .most of the people love travelling in order to discover new places , to rivisit places that they already know and maybe experience them in a new , different way , or just in order to relax by the beach .
[native] hell , they 've even spend a few hundred million on northern ireland putting money into community funds that had to be jointly administered by both sides of the conflict so that they could both begin to understand eachother needs and sides of the story .
[non-native] whenever we want do something we shoud have an idea of what to do in a similar manner whenever a student is studying or doing any practical he shoud have an idea of wat to do and concept of it and then think about the facts .
[native] joe citizen generally does n't have the knowledge , nor the expertise , nor the specialization , to be able to have a meaningful input into how a given provision would affect environmental standards , or consumer standards , or the steel industry , or the chemical industry .
[non-native] having access to several opportunities has change the life of millions of people around canada ; in fact , it is been prove the the most profitable jobs are taken by people who speaks more thant two lenguages and have a broad knowledge of different subjects this behaviour can transform you just by being able to solve problems and be capable to stand up on the rapid evolution of society .
[native] my apologies * ( seriously ) * , but the implication * ( even if i misread it ) * that the united states has n't been pushing targeted sanctions & had to poke the eu to help get them even to these limited ones is kinda annoying .
[non-native] because of three important reasons , i can not agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do even though life becomes convenient and advanced because of technologies .since henry ford has given his famous staement of `` you can get whatever color you want as long as it is black '' the car industry has always been one of the most important achievements of today 's society .
[native] that 's not to say i disagree that they need to engage more , they should also be running more under their european grouping not their national party and that should be fairly fixed what grouping they 're in before the election not after .
[non-native] speaking of aids without speaking of the real dangers in all countries , without speaking of africa 's problems could make a student think that it ca n't happen to him , that it is a rare disease , that he 's not conerned .
[native] i 'll be stuck here and , as someone who has n't taken a vocational path , unable to jump through the vocational hoops put in front of me in order to live abroad - because , let 's face it , if you are n't part of a stem field , you 're fucked regardless of how useful your degree may be in other career paths or how large the demand may be for those career paths ( which are merely labelled ` unimportant ' ) .
[non-native] in fact our businnes is full of products that are all the same , but are continuosly changed adding some more ingredients to make people think it 's a more suitable product , more comfortable , more capable to solve problem than the previous ( which is producted by the same factory ) .
[non-native] the point i agree and why i agree , no one can deny this point that youth are the face of a nation , why this is said by any one , because as they believe it that youth are more energetic and it is their age a big asset not only to him but also to his nation or state or community he belongs .
[non-native] i believe i have strong convictions towards my opinions for the reason that i was part of a group trip that was led by a tour guide for too long period of time during one of my summer vacations and that certainly did not turn out to be a good experience .some people think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today , i disagree , i think there will be more cars as cars are very succesful investment , it is very important way of transportation , and it is a wonderful tool to enjoy your life .
[non-native] of course there are many benefits of being old ( you have experience , you know `` how to live '' ) but i think that the most beautiful part of our lifetime is youth .i agree with the statement , although i believe there are arguments for and against this statement .
[native] in the republic ( i think until recently ) , if you were about to be arrested by gardaí , you had the right to request your rights to be read to you in irish , and if the garda arresting you was unable to read your rights to you in irish you could not be arrested because you were entitled to have your rights read to you in either official language of your choosing .
[native] also , it seems abundantly clear that the case here the requirement for french people to have id cards has no impact on the calais crisis , so obviously making brits carry id cards also would n't help that crisis , so i find it very odd that you are somehow trying to link the two issues .
[native] i thought it was a good hostel , fantastic facilities and big spacious rooms ( i always went for the room with the most beds in it at each hostel to save on price , but the room i was in was so big you would n't have even realised there were 7 bunk beds in it ) .
[non-native] but as they say that nothing is permanent and hopefully this culture will also come to an end and the people will start thinking and will soon realise the importance of helping the community since problems do not come to a community it comes to a person and the community shares it .teaching has arisen debates that are still today difficult to avoid when one has to deal with education , learning or training .
[non-native] i put my standpoint to believe that there are more vehicles in the furture .generally people belive that the students should specialize in one specific subject than to have a broad knowledge of many subjects , because they think that a person will not be taking all subjects in there future .
[native] not only is that not possible without violating many of our most important property laws , if we did something like this it would irrevocably damage our economy , and permanently reduce our ability to produce goods of all kinds that were n't refugee supplies .
[native] > if ukip beat the libdems comfortably in terms of share of the vote , but are comfortably beaten by the libdems in terms of seats ( as currently seems likely ) , this is going to raise all kinds of interesting questions , not least for the lib dems .
[native] that 's not happening in america ; the very existence of twitter , an american company , where tens of thousands of people are tweeting and retweeting witness statements , pictures , and videos and the state does nothing to stop it proves that .
[non-native] on the day we visited the meseum there was a long , long line in front og the main entrance , but the tour guide led us to another small entrance of the museum and we were able to get in without waiting for a long time .
[native] with any political union of such gigantic magnitude , there will always be bureaucratic inefficiencies , political uncertainty , and controversy , but the ability to remain united and show fortitude in the face of all these problems is what will make the eu a super power , as opposed to these problems being what breaks us .
[non-native] to be capable of the most important tools in dealing with academic material which maybe catching the main idea of a text , summarizing basic points , understanding the intention of an author or speaker , etc. is the basis for any kind of apprenticeship .
[native] what i do want to do is to stop for a few minutes at the memorials to think in silence , to reflect on how if i 'd been born into the generation of 1891 rather than 1991 , it would have been me who died for the fantasy of ` king and country ' .
[native] i 'm circumcised ( both parents are ardently non-religious and made their decision more on what was culturally normal at the time ) and i have never felt at any point that i was mutilated nor have i ever felt bitter towards my parents .
[native] as a result nothing ever really progresses , fianna fail does x , fine gael criticizes them for x , they are elected on the basis of x , then they get into office and do x , then fianna fail criticizes them for x repeat ad nauseam .
[non-native] in conclusion , i think we are all getting the benifit we need from those who advertise for there prudacts and also they are getting the same benifit in the way they want it .i disagree with the statement , `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities '' .
[native] within the frame of this sub , there is ~ ~ dragon 's dogma , ~ ~ sw tor , titan quest , grim dawn , torchlight , sacred , neverwinter nights , dungeon siege , i believe fable 3 has some coop , shadow warrior 2 .
[non-native] however , only 64 years ago , in the heart of europe a man raised his voice against the democracy and millions followed him despite his brutulness paved the way for a war massacered millions who followed him and other millions from different nations .
[non-native] just think about the issues which managers of corporations and institutions are called to face every day : most of them do not refer back to one single topic or field of knowledge , but require a mixture of skills and qualifications spanning across a wide spectrum of subjects .
[non-native] so when the roads are blocked due to innumerable number of vehicles , it is obvious that it takes long time to reach your destination & if this becomes the daily routine it vexes the people , so they ultimately look for alternate modes of transport , like the trains or other means of public transport .
[non-native] most of the time the advertisements make a product seem much better than it is by using various methods , with the usage of role models , nice events , nice feelings and plastic - ideal - items , which causes dissapointment after buying the item .when you travel in a group led by a tour guide you will know the most common places that are important and familiar for most of people .
[native] obviously not , not how i intended to word it , most of that has to do with our own pm , however we likely would n't be in the me again had the us not gone in first , so thats what i mean by mixed feelings .
[non-native] so even you do't remmber that formula you can derive it through passages that you understoodi think that there is no real decrease in the amount of time that young people are dedicating to help their comunities nowadays compared to what was usual in the past .
[non-native] bearing all this in mind , i have to say that i believe you can not choose between teaching concepts or ideas , or facts to your students , if you want them not only to understand what your are teaching them , but finding it a practical use in their lifes .
[native] with reddit , every `` thing '' : a comment , a submission , a vote , a user , subreddit css , karma ... are all stored as separate `` entities '' in the database ( or in some cases calculation algorithms for calculating karma , rankings etc ) .
[native] i like feeling my boobs are there and growing but since they are n't that big yet , i kinda prefer avoiding to look in the mirror at my body much :p in fact i really hate it , its part of why i stopped taking daily progress pics !
[native] you bring up an important point , one not many americans realize yet , but our job market is shifting for good , its not temporary , and its shifting in a way which is going to mean unemployment for a lot of people is going to be the norm .
[non-native] in conclusion i would like to underline that it is true that in our society is not present the sense of community helping by the young people , but at the same time it is not correct to accuse young people to be the initiators of this fact because it is only a conseqence of a proces started many decades ago .
[native] furthermore , if you are forcing someone to fight against their will , the whole `` security and prosperity '' part of the military that you are so keen to emphasize , has become functionally obsolete by using the people it 's meant to protect as cannon fodder .
[non-native] with the advent of newer mechanisms of building high rise buildings with parkings at the basements and also the construction of various flyovers on top of the other , assures that man is ever thinking and persevering individual , who works hard and keeps his inventions alive .
[non-native] but if you see this problem like that , you will be obliged to work in it case by case , so in a general view a think that some person consider in many case that with only the concept or the idea the person understand well the problem without to learn the facts .
[non-native] second when people start thinking this way and i will call it the ` black way ' towords the young people , we are not going to make any progress to develop a better generation , the young people should be encourged to go forword not to get critisized by everybody this will couse them to fail before they even got started , may be is a fact that the young people thinks some times only about having fun and missing around but one day it will reach it 's limit , and here begains the encourgment . .
[non-native] as a consequent of this it makes it more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .in my own opinion , in our actual society , advertissements are not here to demonstrate us if the product is good or bad but just to give you the impression that you need it .
[native] it 's simply better for the negotiators to get a full agreement without having to worry about this , and then the deal is public and the people can decide they think it 's more bad than good , hence they 'll shoot it down ( like they did with acta ) or the opposite .
[non-native] for example the ideas is why the apple full down so the ideas became before the facts and after expermintion the ideas be came facts so the live is fact and the end is facts and some ideas can make facts cultuer is fact for that students must learn facts and anderstand the ideas to improve thier skills .i globally agree with the quotation above even if i think that some precisions should be add up to complete it and make it more realistic .
[native] yes , it is true that you would not be part of the zweitestimme , which would mean you would not count in depriving cdu of votes there , but you would still be registering your dissent , as every country normally records spoiled ballots somewhere in the statistics .
[native] that 's why i was redirecting it to france :d [ ohhhhh noooooo , your gdp growth has missed its targets so your deficit is growing , oh that 's terrible , you must feel awful , do n't mind me while i tweak my nipples , tell me more ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hao5ggajmsa )
[non-native] darwins evolution cycle seems to occillating into the positive infinity as the as the idea of what is desirable now is rather ephemeral and what is demended one day might be put on the head with a declaration of nuclear advancement in , lets say indonesia .
[native] the nation with the biggest communist party in europe during the cold war , and the nation with the biggest growth rate in europe until 1992 and still its second industrial force while having a strong tissue of little-medium family business which really offered little to no place to despotic capitalism .
[non-native] advertising is an art of selling things or rather presenting things to the customers , that is us the poor gullible people , in a way that makes them irresistable and desirble , larger than life , so that we will be compelled to buy them .
[native] post wwi , due to decades of work of zionist political activists , the league of nations came to support the creation of a jewish state in what had been ottoman-ruled palestine , transferring the area into the control of the british under the british mandate of palestine .
[native] if they chose to have immigration , and the constituencies have n't chosen to elect a government that would repeal whatever immigration policies they have in place , then yes - i would say that danish and swedish society has a responsibility to those that move to sweden or denmark to became part of those societies .
[non-native] in conlusion , it strikes me that in twenty years there will be not fewer but more cars in use than there are today because of such reasons i have mentioned above .the probleme of the number of cars throughout the world is often debated when talking about polution .
[native] the only threat ukraine poses is that it might fall back more definitively into russia 's orbit , which is n't a very big threat unless we assume that the moment russia gets more influence over the ukraine than it currently has ( and it does , after all , currently already have a lot ) it will suddenly become a danger to the eu - and i do n't think that 's the way it will go .
[native] as in , there is a belief in the uk that because we sent a woman commissioner last time , we are not obliged to send one this time round and that other countries who have tended always to send male commissioners should send one .
[non-native] considering that cars are currently one of the major transportation tools among people in developed countries , i disagree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today because twenty years is just not enough time .
[native] regardless , i do n't think most countries have had anywhere near enough time to recover from the colonial period , and often the way they were transitioned out of colonialism was done in such a haphazard way that there was essentially no institutional capacity building and little attempt to transition them to a western-liberal-democratic model .
[non-native] for example in chemistry understanding how a special reaction occurs can help researchers go further in research by inventing new molecules , find new or develop former reactions ( which were known to take place , but not knowing how it takes place ) .
[native] not in the recent past , no , although as i said in 2012 a space probe did record a very powerful cme at one of the [ lagrange points ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lagrangian_point ) ( i forget which one - you can see from the wikipedia page what the lagrange points are . . basically , they are ahead or behind us in our same orbit . )
[non-native] in conclusion ; i can say that my opinion is in the way that a student should understand the topics except than the ones that do not have any importance in life and only for the period of classtime in the school .i agree that young people enjoy life more thatn older people do , because young people are experimenting every day new things that most of the older people have lived before or already know .
[non-native] in my personal experience with diferent math teachers in my school , i retained the lectures in my brain of those teachers who made us resurche and understand the formula , than those that just gave it to us and gave us a lot of excercises to practice .
[native] we 've got some control over our anal sphincter , but really , it 's just not worth the degree of refinement to hold in every last little bubble of gas , so those escape easily - small bubbles without us even noticing , bigger bubbles with a bit more presence .
[native] ** by next year , the obama administration may actually withdraw diplomatic cover for israel at the united nations ** , but even before that , both sides are expecting a showdown over iran , should an agreement be reached about the future of its nuclear program .
[non-native] moreover , when you study a subject and do understand all important information as well as the idea behind the information given , then when it comes to real life situations and you have to implement what you studied , the feeling that you have achieved something great will cross your mind , and so you will be more keen to actually continue what you are doing inorder to achieve the greatest .
[non-native] other good thing about guides is that they usually are very familiar to the place and its history , they know the little details , shops , stories , costumes and typical food every visitor has to try at least once to get to say they actually been there .
[non-native] this spirit make the companies try to interduce thier products as a best product in the market , and some time those companies do n't have the quality to produce this product then they have to produce an advertisment make customers think this product or this offer is the best choise , but in real this is wrong and the advertisment makes the customer chiose this option .
[non-native] for example , a car advertisement in an news paper showing the picture of the car from the inside , the first impression that a person feels is wow that car is really big which is in reality not true it is just a picture that it is modified to make the car looks bigger .
[non-native] i support my argument by using the following ideas the no of carts that are being used is incresing day by day & it will continue to increse in the future also because the nessity of the cars is more , nower days the temparature is incresing day by day and travelling on two wheeler involves more risk when compared to thecars .
[native] for context , the average ethiopian family in 1990 was having 7 kids and today that is down to an average of 4 , for botswana the same figure fell from 4.7 to 2.7 , for ghana it fell from 5.5 to 4.1 and so on .
[non-native] same times there also can be possibilities that after twety years when science will come up with new inventions and helicopters and planes can be available in cheeper rates as like todays any of the four wheelar or if their fair will reduce to normal train or bus fair then sure there will be less use of cars .
[non-native] in conclusion , i think that only learning a fact is a void learning as it does n't help people to improve themselves , so i will ever try , everytime that i will approach to learn something , to understand ideas and concepts at the basis .i believe that there would be more cars 20 years down the lane than there are today .
[non-native] therefore , i hope a world with few car , but this is not possible , because the people is increasing and they need job , and last ring of this cirle is a transport with cars .some people prefers to have knowledge in many differents subjects , which will stay broad .
[native] however , yes ... there is a strong need in hollywood to paint the war as an american enterprise and the british , french , russian , australian , canadian , indian , new zealand , and all the other nations simply served a supportive role .
[native] it 's not even the apathy from western europe that concerns me , it 's the outright condescension as well , where they think that they , who never had a history of being forced at looking at russia with a wary eye or who spent half a century or more under their domination , know better how to handle russia than eastern europe .
[native] so it is ** no place for a system that tries to eliminate the core function of democracy which is to allow government of that society to evolve - which means that it always must retain its ability to change all laws and policies with the times .
[native] i 'm not sure if it 's especially good compared to the ones you chose , but it 's certainly a prominent member of the three british ` nuclear war is hell ' films : when the wind blows , threads & the war game
[native] kaufland for the normal stuff ( i consider them to be the best of the large supermarket chains , by far ) , sometimes tesco ( hardly as good , but they have ok selection and are the sole importer of my favourite wine ) .
[non-native] even though some people believe they do not needed to sale a product , i would never have good resolt in my little business experiences if i did not used a plan and follow some rules .in my opinon there is no questioon that in twenty years there will be more cars in use than there are today .
[native] i think we can agree that with the benefit of hindsight we would advise britain and france to have executed the war differently : as you suggest , getting prepared for war and attacking germany at an earlier stage would probably have lead to a better outcome and of course this is something that both britain and france regret .
[native] the demonization of sd is due to them being fucking crazy , there has been controvery after controversy about them over how crazily racist they are where [ even their supposedly respectable mps run around harassing foreign-looking people with slurs and blunt objects ] ( https://danielerikvalentin.wordpress.com/tag/sverigedemokraterna/ ) , let alone dozens of other incidents over the past decade .
[non-native] using cars is very effectve and relayable for intown transportations , but these days using cars is becoming harder and harder because of many resons on of them is the increasing in gass value and its becoming mor expensive than before thats why using a car will be wery expensive and some people will prefare using public trasportations like buss and trains , and the other seaon why using car is beng harder is the waste of time in trafic jams , farther more people now care more than ever in the enviroment and many of them can gif alot saving it from polution .
[native] not because there 's anything fundamentally wrong with imperial units , but because it 's clearly not a practical suggestion , which either makes it pure vote-pandering * and * a lie to boot , or it makes cameron the kind of person who comes up with impractical suggestions .
[non-native] in addition , cars are may be the best way to get from one place to another : it is the cheapest way to travel , and you are free to decide where you want to go , even to change your opinion during the travel .
[native] having hundreds of thousands of jews forced on your land ( the pale of settlement ) from the rest of russia during catherine the great 's pogroms , the desperate poverty of the austrian partition always led to emigration rather than immigration , and of course bismarck 's germanification program in the poznan/west prussia areas all lead to significant resistance to foreigners .
[native] at least on reddit you often get told that you as an american should be thankful for the soviets , who totally did everything , and america is a huge cunt who took all the credit , and american schools never teach about the eastern front ever .
[non-native] in order to be a successful person , they always try to make or do new things firstly rather than other people .the number of cars on our planet is a very important problem but we are moving on the right direction and i think in the next twenty years will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
[native] but anyways , expanding on your note , [ liberation and invasion are not exclusive ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/invasion ) , although the target is germany : `` an invasion is a military offensive in which large parts of combatants of one geopolitical entity aggressively enter territory controlled by another such entity , generally with the objective of either conquering , liberating or re-establishing control or authority over a territory ... ''
[native] if the threat is a russian invasion , then most countries would n't count as ` viable ' ; if you gave scotland 10 % of the uk 's armed forces ( but no nukes ) , would you really rate our chances against a determined russian attack ?
[native] and then we get nato , which is comprised of the united states all the way across the atlantic ocean , and then the rest of us in europe who have a military worth a shit or are n't even in nato to start with , and on top of all that , nato 's article 5 for common defense does n't even specify military action in response to a military attack on a nato member .
[native] so , on balance , being very much better than those you 're in a union with , you do n't regard yourself as having any obligation to hang on in there and spend a small amount of your taxes trying to improve them ?
[native] > by the mid-point of the century , if their bet pays off , the world will still be heavily dependent on o&g , america and the middle east will have exhausted or be near exhaustion of much of their oil and gas reserves , the north sea will be drained , and their arctic oil and gas will power not just europe , but much of the world , making them incredibly wealthy , and of course as we see since the russians are n't above basic bully boy tactics , also bringing them great power .
[non-native] i have experience that when i travel without a guide tour with my friend , i was excited at first day but second , third day , my friend and i was got tiredness , so we thought that we do n't want to move from the hotel even we are travering .
[native] [ ** how libya became a french and british war ** ] ( http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2060412,00.html ) > as the military action against libya to give teeth to u.n. security council resolution 1973 began , one question kept nagging away : why , precisely , were the governments of britain and france in the lead ?
[non-native] if you completly understant the subject broadenly both ways , you will be able to aqcuantind about all featurs of this branch indeed , it contribute to became a major this era , and provide to expedite the time to became more adequte to acedemicly increase .
[non-native] for example : poor people nobody take care of them , except when we have a problem and you can do nothing you will go to god and ask god to solve your problem and you will make an agreement with god that if your problem was solved , lets say you will give the poor people food , and thats because they do n't think in poor people at all .
[non-native] this gives a person self convidence for example i 'm an engineer and i know many thins about steel , if any body asks me some questions about it , i enjoy to tell him what he asked and i enjoy read something about it that can be in inthernet or in newspaper .
[non-native] from me as a teenagers , i agree with this statement , not because i 'm still young and i 'm enjoying life right now but i 'm going to explain this is some examples , so i 'm going to right about my opainons using some examples : as we know that old people does n't like to enjoy life so much beacuse they will start to suffer from a lot of diseases which forbid them to move normal and will take there strength away , i have a grandmother that she had a lot of diseases and beacuse of that she 's always slepping and eating and i alwasys ask her to play with me and my borthere 's but she ca n't , so diseases are one of the main resions that make old people hate life and not to enjoy it .
[non-native] further more ideas and concept are easy way to examine the understand of the student and easily presented by the student also the teacher at the same time at the end i well remind with the importance of studying and knowledge to people and student because you with out them mean nothing and no one will respect you some thing other than this students get board from only facts and school books they need to understand and know other ideas which may help them in school and there extirior life .i agree with those who believe that young people nowadays give enough time to helping their communities , for the following reasons : in my town there a lot of helping centres , many young guys take part to activities for disadvantage people and i am an example of young boy who help someone else .
[native] i 'm not sure it 's possible to define these things in law in a way that 's just , equitable and not a potential aid in the creation of totalitarian and authoritarian states -- nazism is not the only way a government can slide into a failure state , as you rightly note .
[non-native] lets not forget that numbers of cars must decrease unless the hole earth will suffer .in ordinary life , we often have to face delimmatic choices , just as the statement gives rise to a debate over whether the understanding of ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts .
[native] i 'm fully aware that it is illegal and that 's why i 'm okay with the current status quo provided the state continues to do its job , the story i was referencing was [ this ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2590501/energy-firms-face-investigation.html ) ( daily mail source , i know ) .
[native] the real question is , why is the `` international community '' so eager to force israel to recognize the independence ( on terms favorable to the arabs ) of a state filled with people who nakedly proclaim their intention to commit genocide on any and all jews remaining in their country ?
[non-native] increase the car need more routs that hihg qawlty some contry can not beulding this routs becouse not enph many for this .in my limited experience , it is quite true that more and more youngsers neglect their own communities and pay scarce time and attention on hepling their communities .
[native] we generally do n't care as much if our government bombs and kills civilians in other countries , because it 's not a threat to our own survival and while many of us say we `` do care '' , we do n't care enough to actually do anything about it .
[native] we 're not actually in a situation where journalists are exclusively using google , but given how little we actually trust our news organizations in the us these days due to corporate interests ( and these same corporate interests having influence over our government ) , an extension or adoption of this ruling in the united states would be absolutely disastrous .
[non-native] nowadays , people are too much selfish and focused on their own individual needs to be able to realize that there is the opportunity and sometimes the real need that their efforts and time are also employed in something which helps the community growing and living .
[native] along with words such as bigot , sexist , even something like fascist or any other kind of word with a similar intent when used in an argument , it is becoming less and less meaningful , as although these words are still being used to silence arguments and points of discussion , in reality the frequency of their use is making them less and less meaningful .
[native] maybe they 'll just lead off with clubs and tazers instead of guns , but that 's still force ( and if you manage to overcome the clubs , you know that the cops are going to return with even more force , whether that means guns or just more officers ) .
[native] even if two out of the three ( but with four names - ) heads are chopped off , even if only one is passed , we 're all likely to see huge , negative repercussions shown graphically by the investor state cases compiled on sites like http://italaw.com caused just by the existing ftas , all much smaller and more local in scope .
[non-native] as a human being every individual tries to be better than what he was and for this he improvises in the skill which he has and after a particular stage when he has internalised that , the person may become saturated in his desires and be satisfied by what he has achieved or he has the choice of expansion , which for a buissnesman will mean buisness expansion but for a research student will mean to know other areas to research upon and try to apply the acquired skills of one area to get fruitful results in the other .
[native] currently , they need new loans to pay off the old loans , so in order to not need to take new loans the old ones will either have to be forgiven or ... well no , that 's pretty much the only thing .
[non-native] some of them are reasonable while the others may not be , but the fact of the matter still remains that communities do not get the time or help or both from the young people of today like they used to a few generations ago .tring new things
[native] i apologize for you having to deal with being forced into living in a world class first world country that was rebuilt from the taxes of a country that you literally killed people in order to continue ruling over just like a grand portion of the rest of the world .
[native] i do n't agree with the circumstances we involved ourselves in iraq under nor do i agree with the way the occupation was initially carried out until about 2007-2008 * ( luckily soon after we got a firm hold on the situation we left / s , but just for reference the iraqi public asked for the withdrawal through a referendum iirc so meh ) * .
[non-native] if they all stay as they are at the moment ( no increase of katastrophes , alternative engeries , and having a car will still be a previlige and not unfeshioned ) cars in use will be found in far bigger numbers in twenty years .
[native] but estonia and lithuania are : [ northern europe ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_europe ) '' a united nations report published in 2011 defines northern europe as including the following ten countries and dependent regions : denmark ( with faroe islands ) , ** estonia ** , finland ( with åland ) , iceland , ** latvia ** , ** lithuania ** , norway ( svalbard and jan mayen ) , republic of ireland , sweden , and the united kingdom ( with guernsey , isle of man and jersey ) . ''
[non-native] concluding this , having specialization is also important but what i feel is there should be a good mixture of complementing each other .i certainly agree with the claim that most advertisements ( re - ) present their products much better than they , in fact , are .
[native] yes if you include famine and accept the absurd exaggerated numbers , which can hardly be claimed to be the same category as what happened under fascism , far more millions every year die from easily curable diseases and starvation under capitalism would you not claim that it is the most deadly economic system by the same logic ?
[native] mandatory training , i can get behind fully , but putting a gun in someone 's hand and forcing them to fight an enemy in a war they did not want to join is cruel under any circumstances and slavery is the only word i could use for it .
[non-native] on the other hand , if a person does not have the capability of adding any innovation to his work , it would be only like the case in which the person fulfills the task given him and structured through other person 's imaginary .
[native] it 's funny , when the shooting was actually happening , i saw three or four threads near the top of r/all ... now that it 's come out that it was n't a terrorist attack , there 's almost nothing ; the_donald has no front page about it , nor does uncensorednews , nor worldnews ...
[native] that 's not saying anything bad about the eu as a whole - post-communist and post-yugoslav members need time and investment to catch up , and the economic mess that is much of southern europe ( killing me btw , i love iberia so much ) is n't helping .
[native] if we manage to boot them down a few pegs and get someone else in government ( or at least dominate a coalition ) we might actually see a change in dynamic , and for the first time see a government that is n't right leaning .
[non-native] because people can make new friends , enjoy and share the travelling experience with others and tourist agency would offer the best arrangement and high efficiency for travelling , i support the idea that the best way to travel is to travel in a group led by a tour guide .to answer the question , if most advertisements make products much better than they really are i want to procide in a certain way .
[native] nah , at its heart most religions talk about the way things are and came to be based on faith , not evidence , and often in the face of contrary evidence so there is a level of ~ ~ stupidity ~ ~ willful ignorance built into religion .
[native] while i do get passionate about topics ( even to the point where i could be called disruptive ) , i am capable of being objective with authority while doing so , so there would n't be a case where i 'd simply abuse it when i got annoyed and cause problems .
[native] for people who are anaware ireland was almost given home-rule ( a sovereign parliament while still remaining as technically part of the uk ) twice shortly before ww1 , but each time the house of lords veto 'd the act , it was at that point a new law was passed that decided the house of lords could only veto an act twice but before the third act was proposed ww1 began and so it was delayed and we had enough waiting .
[native] or i claim that instead we let the people who actual work in the firms take charge of them , because these people are guaranteed to care if their job exists in five years time , who do n't simultaneously own their competitors firms , who are actually involved in how the things they create are made .
[native] the main points , the echo chamber effect and the potential capture of european-level umbrella ngos as part of the system , is important , but it 's hard to see past the author 's biases - to describe the eu as having a `` propaganda budget '' , and to uncritically accept a figure for it that has been much criticised , makes it rather too clear that the author 's view of the eu 's legitimacy is colouring his views of its relations with civil society .
[native] i do n't believe restrictions on fundamental rights is compatible with `` liberal democracy '' , maybe we have different definitions but the first line of wiki explains it pretty well as i understand it : > liberal democracy is a form of government in which representative democracy operates under the principles of liberalism , i.e.
[native] > imagine for example that a new administration gets elected and they want to tighten some environmental protections - with this investment protection clause they would get sued ( in a private court without public oversight ) and would have to pay compensation to the companies who are effected .
[native] under the scenario in which scotland votes for independence and scotland 's eu accession process is slower than scotland 's independence process ( which is presumably what we are discussing here ) it would not be the eu that is depriving scotland of eu citizenship .
[non-native] for example i think that every professor of the most important universities in europe and united states are good ( it is a reasonable assumption for me !!! ) , clever and are able to do well their job , but only few of these can become famous in the world winning the nobel !
[non-native] as i am a student doing a project now and as i see my friends who know only the ideas but not facts suffering because of their lack of knowledge based on it and i myself doing the project and answering the questions related to my project without any difficulty as i know the facts of the subject on which my project is based on .
[native] i 've learned all sorts of odd bits and pieces that way ... i can give the recipe for a horse tonic in german , come out with a few scattered words about milking cows in chinese , say a few food items in afrikaans , a nursery rhyme in japanese , answer the phone in korean ...
[non-native] it is the way of success .some people agree that we should broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject and other people believe that it is better to have deep knowledge in one specific subject rather to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
[native] i worked as a research assistant for a start-up in canada that had totally flexible hours as long as you got your work done ; i would come to work at 10:30 am most days and work later because i hated waking up early .
[native] oooh yes , i imagine ... we have so many stereotypes , urban legends , myths , rumours and exaggerations in the west about asia ... as for the language , though , fortunately i 'm asking for my sister , who 's moving there next week , and she 's been studying the language for three years !
[non-native] although with a broad knowledge you are never excellent in one specific topic and may not see your own academic development in your field of interest , you gain an insight in various subjects and , which is most important , you can also use your knowledge in daily life situations .
[non-native] many companies have a lot of quality measures in order to avoid this problems , for example , a company which develope make up have a lot of test before the product was saled , this is due to the make up could causes many problems in the skin such as allergy reactions or eruptions .
[non-native] in our society , for example , design is widely used to make us buy things that we do not really need : the lack of efficiency of a product can be hidden by its design , or by the pictures and text shown in the advertisements .
[non-native] but the teachers mus n't let the students mislead himself , they must allways leave him on the right track , even if it needs , to correct him , it will still be better than learning wrong stuff .according to the statement , that it is better for students to understand what they learn , namely the concepts and the ideas , rather than learning facts by heart , is convincing to me .
[native] that 's even cheaper than my last cat-sitting gig , which was four indoor pedigree ragdoll cats that needed daily grooming , nails clipped fortnightly , individual meal-plans , and the owners expected me to pay the phone/internet and power bills for their house while they were gone ( my payment for services , they said , was getting to spend time in their nice house and watch their tv ) .
[native] my point with bringing up the ship is that it 's not an instant game-changer for the russian navy , it would be a different matter if france had sold them an aircraft carrier with the ability to extend their sphere of influence considerably .
[non-native] there will always be car enthusiasts who will never give up driving cars , but for the majority of the public , these reasons , and more are convincing factors to switch to other modes of transport and to economize , by car pooling and other ways .
[non-native] i completely agree with the statement if we are talking about me , when i was young , during my primary school , or during secondary scholl too , when i studied general subjects and i had to learn what i prefered to continue to study .
[non-native] i think that is an excelent idea to try to find new things in our life like try to be promoted in my job or try to take more classes in the university instead to be in the same position for the rest of my life , i do not want to be the same person that you meet ten years ago and in the same job .
[native] as long as they hold the referendum according to international standards and find international observers to make sure it is all run smoothly , there is nothing spain could do short of sending in the troops to lock down catalonia and preventing people from voting , and you can bet that would go over well with the eu and the international community .
[native] i think he/she would be riddled with pestilence , have a much higher likelihood of stis , would lack self-control , would more that likely have a drug addiction , have attachment issues and would more than likely have a tendency to negate their responsibilities .
[non-native] first young people are more enthusiastic , hasty , inexperienced , while elder people are well endowed with wisdom , prudent , jurisprudence and compassion etc so they are more devoted to their work rather then to enjoy life , although they enjoy littlebit at their stage of burden of responsibilities but as compare to young people they enjoy less .
[non-native] excessive competetive advertisements makes a lot of distraction in consumers ' minds which obliges companies to make their product seem much better than they really are and to an extent of making their product better than all of the other competetive products ; in other words to make their product `` the unique product '' .
[native] it 's a very similar mentality to the `` little englander '' mentality among uk people who want to pull out of the eu because they think everything will be fine forever if we all just sit on our little island and dont interact with others .
[native] also , i remember an interview with an economist who used to work for the nazi government ( not himself a nazi , but rather a technocrat ) in which he was panning the hierarchical structure of this government , as the most effective way to make decisions was to have hitler 's ear .
[non-native] and if ther is n't , well invent it !because i am not an old person yet , also i do n't live with my granparents and i do n't have close person who is old , so i just can imagine how old people 's life will be .
[non-native] suppose i am secialized in business administration and if someone asks me about the business i am able to answer to all of their questions and if one day someone asks me anything irrelevent to my subject of business i may not be able to answer the question .
[non-native] young people often live life to quickly , without taking enough time to fully appreciate their experiences , which can lead to missing important moments in their life .i think that is better to have broad knowledge , because so there are more possibility of to have a well jobs .
[non-native] so i ca n't agree the statement that successful people are more willing to take risks in gerneral for there are as many reasons speaking against this thesis .we live in a world where , one of the most important things is the image .
[non-native] i will never buy a cheap cloth because i like change very often my product and i do n't want use a lot of money .the the best way to travel does not has to be in a group with a specific tour guide .
[non-native] it is not a wonder that public nacional parks , and family entretaiment centers are more visited by elderly people , who always seem to be more happy and peaceful by just having a walk in the mittel of the forest , by watching a sunrise or just by going in the nature many of them find the most quiet and interesting point in their lifes when they have acomplished most of their professional and educational goals in life , so that they can spend more time at home with their families and friends , so that the can enjoy life .
[native] well , we had that riot in france in which they burned synogogues and jewish stores , the neo-nazis chants during `` anti-israel '' protests in germany , the hitler salutes in the uk , and the assault and ethnic slur of a jewish american by a student `` for justice in palestine '' .
[native] i 've known lots of muslims through work and school and while many were conservative to be sure , i ca n't recall ever hearing one saying anything even close to what was said in this video , or even dressing like this for anything other than a special holiday or something .
[native] ceta , the canadian-eu fta was signed a year and a half ago , and a few months ago the eu and canada announced they 'd both renegotiated to radically change how isds works to take on board public criticisms - based on the influence of public pressure against isds earlier .
[non-native] they get compliments by adult which gives them confident and the feeling they are accepted and not treated `` oi disagree with the statement that says it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
[native] especially considering the fact we have a much more advanced & expansive isr * ( intel & recon ) * network than the french & we 've just dropped about as much ordinance on isis positions in syria within two days as we did in iraq for the past month .
[native] why on earth would any of the baltic nations or poland , all of whom are starting to benefit from being in the eu , want to start a global war in which they will without a doubt suffer extreme casualties , just to get a bit more land filled with russians who hate them and will revolt constantly .
[non-native] is important specialize in anything what be the oportunity bacause the world open yours doors and we must take the firs oportunity and thisis importan because the future depended the dessicion what take in this momet the this dessicion the people can say what have a future surge for example .
[native] [ ** u.s. and russia reach deal to destroy syria 's chemical arms ** ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/15/world/middleeast/syria-talks.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 ) > geneva -- the united states and russia reached a sweeping agreement on saturday that called for syria 's arsenal of chemical weapons to be removed or destroyed by the middle of 2014 and indefinitely stalled the prospect of american airstrikes .
[native] the wolfson economics prize ... will be the second-largest cash prize for an academic economics after the nobel prize . '' -- financial times , october 19 > that there are studies on the other question `` exit eu '' making the media to balance the preponderance of `` in eu '' arguments sorry - a `` preponderance of in eu arguments '' * in the uk * ?
[non-native] so in my opinion we are going to have cars for the next twenty years but the number of them will go down because nowadays people is care about the enviroment and every day we prefer to go by bike or using the public transport before using the car .
[non-native] he will always take the best financial decision and at the same time will always have a strong opposition inside his team or industry , because as he does n't know the history and the culture of the people behind the business , he will never be able to respect them .
[native] this is similar to government owned ( in that it is owned by the people ) but is separate from the government in that the customers would directly vote for the execs who run the organisation , rather than having those execs selected by government .
[non-native] i think that this last effect of publicity is very negative and should be fought by expressing this point publicly and often .where i live , in japan , some people think that young people today spend a plenty of time to help their communities .
[non-native] however , one can not deny the good side of this issue , that is one may sound fool when a person don , t have a good background about a particular issue other than is special subject , especially in a friend circle or while teaching lessons to the student but i feel that the advantages of mastery outweighs the drawbacks .
[non-native] first of all it is true that you have to have many academic than one specific subject , because if you only have one specific subject you might get bored and you wo n't get well on it , but if you have many academic subjects if you are bored on that you can go to the next one .
[native] with respect to the sco , i stand by the fact that they did not need to bring it up there as the world already knew that those two breakaway states were de-facto under russian patronage and protection , and that it was a blunder by russia to bring it up .
[native] it does n't matter how long they 've owned it , it does n't matter how long the russians owned it before them , crimea is internationally recognised and lawful sovreign territory of ukraine , which russia has illegally infringed on with no casus belli .
[native] meh , it was more than the battle of the boyne , and it was part of a wider conflict - i 'd say the boyne is the most famous one just as a result of how major the unionists have made it out to be , but the battle of aughrim is probably the biggest battle out of that entire conflict .
[native] allowing isps to strike deals with individual sites is fundamentally different from allowing them to offer plans ( or maybe even placing an extra charge ) sites that , as a type , place a much larger strain on the network than all others .
[non-native] these two elements in my value system are not a magic keys to instant happiness but they are keys for doing whatever makes us happy without falling into painful situations .i do agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
[native] > if you ca n't see that the deaths of so many innocent people is completely wrong it is n't a matter of the deaths being wrong , of course it is . . it 's a matter of who 's responsible for the deaths .
[non-native] in conclusion , visiting a new place with a right tour guide can make the travel so much easier and effiecent than a group of people trying to find their way and not being able to explore every great detail about the place .for me , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because in this wey we can have more possibiliy to change my life .
[native] i can see myself taking five hours on a row of three skills for , say , russian , turkish or irish - something i 'm not very good at - to work my way through at a pace i can take it in , and then strengthen to actually learn it .
[non-native] life must go on and go forward , the wheel of progress must run all the time , we need more and more people who open the door wider into new experiences and new adventures , hence new life that is completely different from those whose life is always full of monotony .traveling is one of the best ways to have fun and get more knowledge about other coultures or whatever new things .
[non-native] if scientist will do something different like if he/she can modify the form of carbohydarte like gelatinized and nongelatinized carbohydrate then incorporated in fish feed then fish may be utilize more than previous then if fish utilize more then chances of growth will be more then it may be appreciated by everyone .
[non-native] in conclusion , i think it is much better to specialize in one specific academic subject than many different ones because it makes one concentrate more on what is personally important and therefore lets one view what is around in a different and better way .nowadays the burden placed on the youth is indeed much heavier than that on the previous generations .
[non-native] it was completed from objective examples that i suggested in the writing .it is dificult to forecast the evolution of the use of cars in twenty years , because it depends on a lot of factors that could change in such a long time .
[non-native] concluding , i feel optimistic in the decrease of number of cars in use in a twenty years time owing to its much awaited advantages and long lasting effects both for a safe city and for a better nature .when faced to the questions that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well , different people had disaparate views for that .
[native] this is exactly what the eu was meant to be set up for , in a world in which we 're pulled between two aggressive and greedy superpowers the eu was to look out for our own interests and not to be played like pokerchips between those two , yet people have forgotten this since the cold war ended and act as if america is some sort of benevolent force looking out to protect us , fuck this attitude we have to protect ourselves .
[native] cuba , you 're correct , is still using cars built in the 50s , but there 's also special circumstances - its primary trade partner and , coincidentally , sole world superpower , the united states , has had it under embargo for over five decades .
[native] > > some people think zhirinovsky is only a jester but there is also another opinion : government use zhirinovsky to give population clues about possible development of situation in the future so people could `` digest '' certain ideas before they ** become reality ** ; > i live in romania and i really , really hope the ` other opinion ' is n't true .
[non-native] as an example , i would feel more comfortable debating on a president 's policy if i took a class about the contemporary history of the country he is leading to understand how he got elected , a sociology class to understand who elected him and a political sciences class to analyse the way he communicates his ideas and wht conclusion i can draw based upon his behaviour .
[native] in terms of learning , iirc there 's a lot of redundant bullshit that you 'll never use as a tech , but it can still be useful to know because it gives you a more comprehensive understanding of how computers actually work internally .
[non-native] sometimes when a person sees an advertisement comercialising shoes , they commonly look softer and more confortable than they really are , when the person gets into the shop and fit them often notice that the shoes were not as good as they look on televison .
[non-native] all in all , it is cartain that students find it more important to understand the ideas and concepts rather than learning the facts but i hope one day it will change and we will start thinking of the facts more than we do today .
[non-native] it can be used for a lot of different purpouses and as a lot of people like to show off and live in great luxury , the car will not disapear in the next twenty years .`` where there is a will , there is way '' .
[non-native] for instance , if you are in new york and you wish to spend more time admiring the glittering times square at night , you may not be able to because the tour guide will have a precise timed schedule that he must stick to .
[non-native] in the same way the student can write the chemical reaction of the process of photosynthesis by understanding that it invoves oxygen and carbondioxide to form carbohydrate thus all branches of science can only be studied by understanding ideasn and conceptsit is a well known fact that it is only in the hands of the youth that the destiny of a society rests .
[non-native] if we look back at the 1960s , the situation was more complicated : in those days , people were demonstrating in the streets to gather certain rights such as the right to divorce in italy and the workers ' class claimed more facilities to improve their life conditions .
[non-native] i am sure that the real progres is in the hads of people that are able to solve problems in a wide rage , because it is important that for each small change in one direction something , maybe far , will change as well .
[non-native] i agree and disagree with that statement because sometimes you can see an old person is enjoying his \ her life and that depend on his feelings , money , health , and thinking about how he \ she is going to spend the rest of her life either in joy or sad .
[native] the obvious endgame option is sanctioning of the energy market in it 's entirety , particularly the enormous gas market , and preventing russia from accessing european capital markets ; the result of which would very likely be the collapse of the russian economy altogether , which nobody is eager to see .
[non-native] so , when you study electronics , and you learned every fact about building personal computers , and later came to a factory that builds car computers , most of the facts you learned may be useless , but the concepts of creating a computer in general may come in very handy .
[native] 41 in total - i 've lived in czech republic , slovakia & poland : albania , armenia , austria , belarus , belgium , bosnia & herzegovina , bulgaria , croatia , czech republic , denmark , estonia , finland , france , georgia , germany , greece , hungary , ireland , italy , kosovo , latvia , lithuania , luxembourg , macedonia , moldova , montenegro , netherlands , poland , portugal , romania , russia , serbia , slovakia , slovenia , spain , sweden , switzerland , turkey , ukraine , uk , vatican city .
[non-native] knowing that for example there are more and more foundings when refering to science , a perosn every day more finds the time and will to study interrelated subjects to the specific topic he works for , like in the case of a medical doctor : every day there are new findings of any disease that imply a minimun knoledge in chemistry or physics and if a doctor only focuses on the anatomic part of the person or on the biological part of the problem , he may sometimes not be able to figure out what is happening to the person , if instead this physician is aware of new findings and has taken courses about realted subjects , he will not necessarilly have a hard time knowing what the problem is .
[non-native] for example if you want to give a present to someone , you just have to put it in the case of your car whereas , if you would use public transport , you would have to bring it everywhere during all the day and to walk with it , it is not very usefull .
[native] there are countries where people in poverty are starving and have no access to water and then you have americans moving away from these things by leaving their towns to move into areas that ca n't survive without massive irrigation infrastructure and still want bullshit like perfectly manicured lawns in the middle of a desert .
[native] the essentially protestant ruc used the army to target nationalist areas , which led to the catholic population seeing the army as just an extension of the loyalist groups , one better armed and trained , that had the support of the british population .
[non-native] for example when we saw advertisement on television about fast food , in particular mac donald , the burger seems perfect , i mean that he is bigger than the restaurant 's one and seems to have more ingredients but when we go to the restaurant , we have another vision , we have the impression that what we saw at the television is really different than what we have in our plate .
[native] losing one of the main voices of trade liberalization within the eu would only make it that much harder for the uk to sign a mutually beneficial trade deal with the eu following a brexit as the balance of power shifts away from those .
[native] well , i can if the person that owns over 50 % of our newspaper distribution is an american citizen with a strong and clear political bias that puts headlines on the largest selling newspaper saying ` kick this mob out ' ( with respect to the last elections ) .
[non-native] in summary , from my perspective , it is better for students to gain knowledge of many concepts to be successful in their future professional life .with the decision of the governor of california to sue the biggest car-makers , the burning issue of the environmental effects of car driving seems to occupy once again the front of the political stage .
[native] it 's unknown how future political/trade scenarios will play out , particularly with global warming , and it 's extremely difficult to build an agricultural base from scratch , so it 's far more prudent to ensure the one in place survives in one way or another .
[native] lot 's of people ca n't necessarily read everyones different cursive ` fonts/personal styles , i stopped writing cursive in highschool because not everyone can read it/read it well , so i did n't want to risk a marker not understanding something i wrote or skipping over a sentence/word , and i always managed to be one of the people who could write down the most under exam conditions .
[native] for the irish banks ' loan books to balloon up to 3.5 times irish gdp , only a small amount of non-irish money was needed , and most if that seems to have come from the us and uk - hardly a surprise , given that 's where irish banks traditionally raise money .
[native] one day i 'd like to get on with the russians ( imagine how scary a russia-eu alliance would be ) , but with current approach from both sides ( russia 's imperialistic view of its neighbours and the west 's aggressive stance on russia in general ) .
[native] it 's long , but they go into detail about how the study is poorly done [ here ] ( http://cdn.streamovations.be/events/ep/150305-1500-ttip-trade-and-regulatory-co-operation-benefits-and-costs.php ) , as well as [ much more succintly by the state secretary for european affairs in the government of portugal here ] ( https://euobserver.com/opinion/127103 ) .
[non-native] although the awareness of this problems , some advertisements sell a product , such as chocolate , by saying that it does n't contain fat and , as a consequence , it does n't make you get fatter so you can eat it whenever you want .
[non-native] in india a tabla player ( who is a compser as well as a musician ) first learns many facts ( compositions ) , and then , after a long time of practising and trying to adapt the tradition he might introduce new features and invent his own compositions .
[native] i do n't think they would be equipped to do that if they did n't have a space where they could be supported in exploring their potential , or experiment with things like successfully advocating for gender neutral washrooms on campus , and yeah , to some degree supporting that requires protecting them from people that think they 're sick and that they do n't deserve to exist .
[non-native] if you want to sell a hair lotion that will make your hair grow back eaven if you are sixty years old , you can ' t say it will also seriously damage your hormon sistem or else i think every prson in the world would prefere to have a little less hair but a better helth .
[native] it 's worth noting that in the absence of an invasion , germany did try to anschluss switzerland in the same way it had done austria , reaching out to prominent politicians and local activists , although that 's a whole other post in itself .
[non-native] in conclustion , the most ideal way to travel is to go on a trip with a group led by a tour guide for safty and to enjoy , and if a person would like , then he/she could take some free time from the group and the tour guide .there are two different aspects which makes the question difficult to answer if it is better to have broad knowledge or to specialize in one specitic subject .
[non-native] however , if there is a view that people should obtain miscellenanious knowledge of many academic sujects , because by this , they could knew our colorful world , which i take leave to suspect , then it is the romantic and naive people who create it , not those who never fail to be with considerations of reality , in so far as it is universal acknowledged that studying many subjects would wast our time , on the other hand , we should maximaze our time to study something that will help us live in the competition .
[non-native] i agree that there may be have a caple of advantage of have specialize in one speciffic subject , however it is more disadvantage abviouse of have specialize in one specific subuect such as also tap dancer , if they just learn tap dance , they must not better than the person who can more kind dance .
[native] not of their own will , they 're mostly incompetent as fuck ( seems to be a valued trait in the dáil , incompetency ) , but if we want to get even a remote semblance of real politics , we have to get rid of ff and fg and start working on the left-right poles and not the pro-treaty and anti-treaty ones .
[non-native] this strategy gets a lot of monez for the company , but only the first time , because the costumers are not stupid and after buying one or two times this product they wo n't come back to the company with such a bad quality .
[native] i spent one afternoon in paris though , and was shocked at this blonde , rich , white kid cursing the french national team ( ce sont tous des putains d'islamistes ) and praising their spanish opponents ( ca c'est une vraie equipe europeenne quoi ) .
[native] and you do that by highlighting an extraction method that accounts for only 5-10 % of u.s. consumption , and i 'm guessing - since the rest of the world uses coal and does n't mine by mtr mining - a method used for like ( i 'm guessing ) 0.5 % of world consumption ?
[non-native] of course i do n't think that a specific preparation ist't correct , it can be use to have a better preparation in your kind of work and a possibility to be more essential that other people , but for some personal reason i prefere do n't have a specific preparation , but a more large vision on various argoument .
[native] but when the negotiations are done in public , it makes it very easy to point to concrete clauses and do very targeted campaigning to kill that clause , which means more red lines in the sand , and less that can actually be negotiated on until eventually there 's nothing that can actually be negotiated because of all the interest groups .
[native] pride in your nation , your federation , your people 's history - what have you - is not a bad thing , and fascism and nazism have really spoiled it for the rest of us 70 years later with their chauvinistic nationalist ideals .
[non-native] and since there is no other material which has a comparable energy density - i can not tell the exact number but i know that the energy density of oil is at least a factor of about 1x10 to the power of 2 higher than the energy density of coal or gas - and is available in the necessary amount it will be very difficult to substitute this ressource .
[non-native] in this time if you go to all shoping center you will find all toyss for all young people , for older people normaly its like in aour cantry must of older people they as afther and looking after the cheldren and they have to preper all things fo a fammily .
[native] overall , while as i say i 'd like to see more action on ukraine , i 'd still go with henry v : `` when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom , the gentler gamester is the soonest winner '' of course , he was thinking of not raping , killing , and looting , so it may not be entirely apposite , but i guess i 'd have to point to outcomes again - say balkans as against iraq .
[non-native] if we go through the academic way there will definitly increase inthe burden in the subjects in this manner we can improve our skills to solve a problem , if we are concentrate only one subject it will be good only to that subjects where we can score good marks only in that subjects , here the main disadvantage is that we can not solve different kind of problems , he may be profeessional in that subject than also he can not use the other tactics which are known in other subjests .
[non-native] and another thing is that young people at this time is physical fit to partcipate in any sport and event to entertain themself .i strongly believe that people who try new things and take risks are more successfull than people who keep doingg what they already know how to do well .
[native] here 's the relevant [ article ] ( http://theaviationist.com/2012/07/13/fia12-typhoon-raptor/ ) > indeed , it looks like the f-22 tends to lose too much energy when using thrust vectoring ( tv ) : tv can be useful to enable a rapid direction change without losing sight of the adversary but , unless the raptor can manage to immediately get in the proper position to score a kill , the energy it loses makes the then slow moving stealth combat plane quite vulnerable .
[non-native] obviously , math or phsicology faculties teach more about ideas than facts while in engineering or economics the students will study more practical cases but the main idea remains the same and is that students are made first to learn theory in order to apply it succesfully in a more profitable way .recently , there are many kind of way to enjoy own life .
[non-native] as an instance of this situation is that in lectures according to a student for the taking the course from a person who is specialized on that course is so much educated rather than the taking from the person who is not really interested in that course that much .
[non-native] in the past year , the cost of the national products has been incresing because they are compair whit the international products for example cars or dreess make in asia when the material are more chip , for this reason a disagree with that the most prodcuts seem much better than they really are .
[non-native] the use the concept with any idea produce new knowledege , for example if i use an idea about how analyst the land change , i use the remote sensing concept , and i generate new knowledge about the land change , how the deforestation increment in an area .
[non-native] all these can explain why there will be fewer cars in twenty years .i disagree with the statement becuase young people have some times a better way to express their emotions , in some cases they have more energy than older people but , it does n't mean that older people lacks energy to express what they feel about life , it just a natural behavior that older people are more reserved than young people on expressing emotions .
[native] now , we can learn the answer to this question for our selves by heading on over to the [ unhcr 's monthly datasets on global asylum-seekers ] ( http://popstats.unhcr.org/en/asylum_seekers_monthly ) ( that 's the un refugee agency , for those unfamiliar with the weird acronym ) , and [ specifying our relevant variables ] ( http://popstats.unhcr.org/en/asylum_seekers_monthly/asvqir ) .
[non-native] secondly , i think that one person choses to start the universitary studies that person have done the choice of indicate in which specialization it wanna work and for this reasons i recon a people decided to begin its walk inside one academic program that person should be ready for take a study path for its future job .
[native] severe space weather events -- understanding societal and economic impacts : a workshop report ( 2008 ) http://www.nap.edu/download.php?record_id=12507# also why fukushima was preventable james m. acton and mark hibbs - its a carnegie report - it goes into a lot of detail about the `` loss of the ultimate heatsink '' problem .
[native] because serious errors of this kind are habitually committed when the term ` race ' is used in popular parlance , it would be better when speaking of human races to drop the term ` race ' altogether and speak of ` ethnic groups ' *
[non-native] specializing in one acadimic field and not subject is the most essential for me , for instance : if i chose a way that is most suitable for me and wish to pass it then i have to take a look on all the subways and instructions and neither pass it straightly nor blindly .
[non-native] in contrast , student who take three or four subjects are very busy and stressed , because they have to prepare for many exams and see different lecturers , which is confusing and the results are not as good as those of the ones from the one subject plan .
[non-native] as an example let 's take ocean city maryland in the united states , whoever going to the different websites offering this touristic destination can see the atlantic ocean as the perfect background for a nice trip , we make a reservation and finally get there , nobody told us about the vehicular congestion , visual pollution and the noise made for teenagers running their cars overspeed .
[non-native] if our lives were more organized and less occuppied , perhaps an interest in helping our communities would surface .young people these days are attracted by the modern facilities. , like chating with their friends on the internet , going to shoping malls , going to international parks like , desney land or sea world .
[non-native] therefore i recommend students to understand the ideas or the concept than to acknowledge only the facts .these days , many people are willing to help their communities through many ways such as donating clothings or money , however , some people think that young people appears to be putting little time to help , but i disagree with this statement because of two reasons .
[non-native] what i strongly believe in twenty years is that even though there are many projects to keep our environment clean from the gas from the car , there is no decrease of the car uses because people wants the nice car and it actually gives great opportunities to live in out fast moving world in order to being a successful man/women .
[native] > see cases : saunders v. uk ; khan v. uk ; allan v. uk ; jasper v. uk ; edwards and lewis v. uk ; al-khawaja and tahery v. uk ; i did n't have time to read all of these , but have taken a quick look at one at random : al-khawaja and tahery v. uk .
[native] given how much effort it has taken to get us to where we are now in ukrainian sanctions , do you really see the german or italian courts seizing the state assets of the russian government that happen to be in germany or italy ?
[native] as an example , if i am starving to death and you give me some mass-produced croissants , i will be happy that i 'm not starving , but i might say to my brother , gee , i sure wish i had a pizza right now .
[non-native] you may think that the number of cars is more likely going to increase by two or three folds , this is unlikely to happen for few reasons , first , in oredr to fit this great number of cars new roads should be built and the old one should be expanded to fit the significant number of cars , which means that government have to reconstruct the infrastructure of the cities in order to apply such alterations and to so great deal of money must be spent that will most probably exceed the government 's budget in most countries , on top of that the international economy is declinig and the economist perdicitons indicate that this decline will continue for next 40 or 50 years ahead .
[native] during that time , the eu could very much hammer out protocol with the provisional government of scotland , but that 'll only be because at that point , independence is a reality and it does n't effect the internal matters of the uk .
[non-native] although some people think that the best way to trip is an alone without tour guide , i do strongly support the idea of the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because of two reasons , first one is tour guides are know where we have to go and secondly if you have never been to there you need a leader who helps to you how to visit and how to spend their time enjoyable there .
[non-native] in conclusion , student who know in deep concepts and ideas are able to perform easier in any field because their motivation , learning and creativity will make them to apply his knowlege in any task in life .in everyday life the car has become essential : with a car you can move easily and quickly from place to place and you are also free to organize your day as you want , without being worried about bus or train schedules .
[non-native] nowadays , most people think that personal behavior and private is more important than any other things , but in traveling , from my point of view , it is different .some old men usually say that with the daily universities guys know `` everything about nothing '' .
[non-native] our memory can be easily paralleled with an archive : an empty archive with a rational structure and the right labels already in place can be filled in no time , an archive which is full of paper but where organizational mayhem reigns , is going to be almost useless , or require an excessive effort to get anything valuable out of it .
[non-native] in the end , i think one mus n't stop learnig in life , i would like to continue to study the subjects i prefer and learn new ones that can be help me to be a better person .i dissagree with the opinion that the way to travel in group led by tour guide .
[non-native] so , people will prefer new tranportation systems which cause a decline on the number of cars in twenty years .people travel to different places , to enjoy their vacation or to acquire the knowledge and historical improtance of the place they are going ot visit or to spend time with friends and relatives or to take some time off from their daily routine work .
[native] 100 % of people should have access to public sector employ or comparable jobs ) and if that is impossible ( not all of europe 's government 's are exactly fiscally healthy ) , then the benefits need to be lowered until they can be made universal .
[non-native] in conclusion , the high environment cost of using the automobile and the raising prices to its ownership are factors that will create a reduction in world 's car ownership .in later years advertisenments have increased a lot , especially on tv and newspapers .
[non-native] although you are not sure if this will be accepted among people or not , as long as you are in the secured fields which have already known or done , you will never get a chance to succeed , or you will have less oppotunities to succeed .
[non-native] but in my opinion even this would rather lead to a transformation in the kind of fuel used in the future , hopefully sustainable and recyclable , than to a reduction of car users in the world .i do not agree with the statement of fewers cars will be in use in the next twenty years than today .
[non-native] finally , i am sure that it is important for a student 's education to study a lot of subjects and then , after theree , four , five years , decide a specialization in one specific subject .some people believe that they must not help other people if the actions do not provide any benefit to themselves .
[non-native] to conclude , i 'll sum up the previous points i 've discussed about : it 's obvious that you can try to understand everything you 're told without learning but you 'll have some issues to understand the whole thing , you might understand a part of it .
[native] the interest is in stopping russia from committing further acts that are illegal under international law , of going against the international community , of being a warmonger , as well as to reinforce the international order and counter challenges to western global supremacy .
[non-native] to conclude , we can say that this unhealthy change that is being observed in our society will have malignant effect and must be balanced by taking necessary and efficient steps .i agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
[non-native] if i have never heard about cancer or diabetes i will probably not wory about it , as in the old ages where they believed it was some illness caused by spirits or demonds , but once i know about i can cut of the sugar in the case of a diabetic or have chemo or radiation for cancer and worry about it .
[non-native] according to this above , i think a student had better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .i think for students to understand idea and concepts is more important than for them to learn facts .
[non-native] i think he has won his bet but i hope , one day , i 'll come back to work near home .i rather agree and disagree with the statement that ` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities ' .
[native] japan and south korea are now the focus of our actions and arguably america 's two most important allies and the countries i consider our most important overseas partners ( canada will always be number one due to geographic and cultural shared areas ) .
[native] on an individual level , i 'm not doing much harm by being discriminatory -- in this case , i am not actively hurting or offending anyone ... and if it means removing a large risk factor in my kid 's safety , i 'll do it ... even if it 's technically not the right thing to do in the context of what 's good for society .
[native] i think the whole flag change thing is cynical distraction from more important issues , but we ca n't change the fact that the referenda will happen in the order john key wants them to happen in -- labour does not seem to realise this .
[native] there is decent shopping , restaurants , the river walks are nice , there are lots of activities in the surrounding areas , hamilton gardens is gorgeous on a summers day , the bus services is functional ( mostly ) , rents are cheap .
[non-native] for example if a young man wants to go for a tour in his holidays then the first thing that comes to his mind is where to go , whom to take , when etc but when a old persom considers a trip to go somewhere the first thing that comes to his mind is how long will be the journey and what all precautions he needs to take .
[non-native] `` a successful people will try until get the good results , and never stop trying ''what i think about this case is goin for the first choise which is , its better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , because when a person have that knowledge about the academic subjects other than in one specific subject , sure a person would have a job which has a one specific subject for exampel , a doctor , his feild or his main subject that a doctor should be know about it is medican and body since in general , but that dose not mean he only have to know what about his job only , well whats wrong about haveing knowledge about other things for example , a knowledge of art , how great is to find a doctor wich his clinic is full of his art work or some he bought in his own taste of art , a normal person if he walks in a place like that he would say that this doctor is not like any other doctor .
[native] it actually looks good , no i will not show anyone , but the women i have dated and/or have seen my gentlemen sausage have all commented it has the pleasing look of a circumsized penis while having the benifits of loose skin like an uncircumsized penis .
[native] you 're flagrant disregard for the rule of law ( as evidenced in the vigilante attack on the roma child ) combined with many of your populist and far right leaning beliefs means i think you 're dangerous to society , but i do n't hate you .
[non-native] in that way , if they migth be able to understantd than a principle is a mathematical model to discretize and represent an aspect of the life , than they will be able to appreciate different appearences af unique natural principle in the each common aspect of the life .
[native] i agree with most of what you say , but i do n't like your last paragraph -- not that i do n't * agree * , but i do n't like the way you come across -- you seem to imply we should all just shut up and stop questioning because `` that 's just the way the world works '' .
[native] > i feel like britain should act swiftly out of moral obligation to the eu ( ca n't imagine they actively want to hurt so many people with uncertainty ) so you would rather them hurt the eu because they rushed into negotiations while still trying form government ?
[non-native] advertisements are to promote the products and to make the consumer feel that this is something really big for example there is a advertisement for hidden vally ranch salad dressing and it goes like this , there is a girl sitting in her dining room and she takes a bite from her salad boul .
[non-native] in spite of the fact that it is more important and preferable choice to learn the facts instead of learning same ideas and concepts all the time , it is necessary for students to be successful in their class , and also many teachers do n't open new facts in the world .
[non-native] also , try to help them to find their on way of thinkning amd analysinig the ideas and the concepts rether than just teach them in general facts which probably they are going to forget in the end of the simister .i there was n't twenty years a go , but i know that in that period there were fewer cars in use than there are today .
[non-native] ending my work , i sume everything , simply , saying that not only cars will be fewer and fewer , but they will disappear , because polluition , economic conditions and social reasons are doing it .there has been an argument regarding the issue that the best way to travel is a tour in a group generated by using tour agencies .
[native] but make no mistake , the vast majority of leftists do not support russia - organizations like wsws ( probably the most obvious example of russian shilling ) are widely disliked amongst the leftists that * are n't * wsws ( though that 's because they 're huge pieces of shit , not specifically because of russia ) - however , while leftists do n't support russia , that absolutely does not mean they support ukraine .
[non-native] because of all these possible reasons i disagree with the statement that in twenty years from now , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .the subject at hand is wheather young people enjoy life more that old people or not .
[non-native] but who knows how long that is going to be . ..being good at what you do and sticking with it it may take you far , then your abilities and skills may be neede to the job or activitie you may be enhence to performed , but somehow the people who are willing to think outside the box and take risks are the ones that succed .
[native] read more here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungary%e2%80%93poland_relations here 's an example of that : > in six months , during his 1939 invasion of poland , the common polish-hungarian border would become of major importance when admiral horthy 's government , on the ground of long-standing polish-hungarian friendship , declined , as a matter of `` hungarian honor , '' hitler 's request to transit german forces across carpathian rus into southeastern poland to speed that country 's conquest .
[non-native] in conclusion , if you do n't want to think a lot and you want have fun , to feel safety and to be smart by the dealing with the people , just travel with a tour guide .i totally agree with the idea that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one spesific subject .
[non-native] however if its a place that 's already familiar to you , it would be much more enyoyable to go with a partner and enjoy the country as you know it .i would agree with the statement that `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialise in one specific subject '' i think it is wise to be a ` jack of all trades but may be master of none ' .
[native] the usa is still the most powerful country in the world , and it 's current high debt-to-gdp ratio is attributed to the election of george w. bush who 's administration decided they wanted to fight two costly wars in the middle east for a period of more than 10 years .
[native] they also exploited workers in france ( at the flamanville nuclear plant ) , the netherlands ( at the eemshaven plant ) , sweden , ireland , ... [ ikea accused of social dumping and exploitation ] ( http://www.equaltimes.org/ikea-accused-of-social-dumping-and?lang=en#.vdwurnsucri ) ** september 15 , 2014 ** any more insults ?
[native] you are pathetic for claiming usa making an attempt at winning the war in vietnam and losing the same as you sitting there and thinking writing an angry letter when an ally is invaded and jerking off to how superior germany is to the rest of the word is considered the same thing .
[non-native] with this kind of persons our society is no possible to develop , all the countries are getting development scales is because the people is trying to do the best and working every day taking new risks , only for this way we cant to get the development .
[non-native] in addition to this , the humankind should'nt believe to the advertisements that are not lying on proofs , for example , a person wants to buy a shampoo that he has got used to but he sees a new product that is the half price of the shampoo he got used to , would n't he just try out once because of the price no matter his or her budget is .
[native] well its when the french have a 35 hour working week , some of the longest holidays in europe , retire at 62 ( or 55 if you work for the sncf ) , have a labour market so tight companies avoid employing people and have n't passed a balanced budget since 1978 maybe , just maybe , some reform is needed .
[native] this is what cameron does , when he realises he ca n't make good on his commitments while in the eu , he back-peddles like fuck and exclaims how everything is actually rosy , when he 's really just manipulating statistics supported with a deceptive use of vague language .
[non-native] if i were planning to be a mountaineer for example , i would be able to deal with the whole situation much better if i understood that air pressure is much more at higher elevationi totally agree with this statement , cause i think its really the best way to discribe a successful person .
[native] some people may be brought up one religion ( dawkins called this child abuse , which is a stretch and a half , but made the point that a child would n't be called a tory child if born to tory parents and the same should apply to religion ) .
[native] that ** i yield to the superior force of the united states of america whose minister plenipotentiary , his excellency john l. stevens , ** has caused united states troops to be landed at honolulu and declared that he would support the provisional government .
[non-native] he always said in his life time , that ` i am the happiest person in this world '' he went to war comming back with nothing , he lost all his family and house then , but he worked hard and he built 3 buildings and became quite rich .
[non-native] moreover , pollution is becoming a problem even more dangerous for the health of everybody and all the diseases caused by pollution are making people aware of the necessity of an alternative to the use of the car and of other polluting private transports like motorcycles .
[native] i agree it would be great if it could be done globally , but if the current system is insufficient within the eu ( i do n't know if it is or if it is n't , i 'm just speculating here ) , and it 's within the power of the eu to harmonize some laws relating to that , then i do n't see a problem .
[native] we can keep increasing the minimum wage , but all that will lead to in the long run is capital flight to other , poorly regulated countries , as is happening now with manufacturing and resource harvesting in south america , africa and asia .
[non-native] thanks to it , we can be experts in this subjects and learn a lot of interesting things .i do agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
[non-native] success people if aproblem has arise in their task they also know how to over come the task they will develop a character that it will not be able to distinguish by the people who think same , success people are the people who dare to do everything even though if they are failure in their task they know how to overcome from the problem they ill again try for the same task success people are the people who invent the new things they all of a sudden not became success in their life they had gone several up and down in their life , they had spent many sleepless nights they had worked for the people they lets take example telephone is invented by alaxader graham bell if the telephoen is not invented how the communication is made possible ?
[non-native] one example is when i was younger , i wanted to be a teacher , but a i was afraid , because i did not know what grade level i will be teaching , becasue when i was a college student , i used to practice second grade , and it was the grade level that i liked , but i thougth about it , if i wo n't take the risk , i wo n't find out how well i will be as a teacher in a high grade level .
[non-native] if u want to study a major or a subject and you like and love this major you want to bulid your career on it but you heard that this major is very diffcult to take it and get a high grade , you take the major and you get your high grade .
[non-native] but from my point of view and my young background , i think that most young people enjoy their life more than older people , just because of the fact that they are more open and do not worry about their future as much as older people do .no i donot agree with the statement .
[non-native] additionally , being led by a tour guide will help me in managing my time since all tour guides willl have a set or a planned schedule from the begining of the trip and until the last day in order for the visitors to get the most of their trip .
[non-native] by the other hand , i think that older people also enjoy life , because no matter the age that you have you wll always learnig , and in this point of your life you have more experience , so you dont have to worried about if you are going to make a mistake , becouse you know that if you make it everything will be ok .
[native] and neither mcguinness nor adams have utilized their powers as statesmen to take violent action against innocent civilians , any crimes they may have committed in the past are their crimes and holds no weight on the irish state in the same way the actions of previous british administrations certainly does , not only in ireland but throughout the godforsaken empire .
[non-native] but if they have the slightest bit of time that they can determine by themselves , i am sure they use it for their own amusement , for cultur , fun , sports or just to spend the time with their friends and family .
[non-native] in conclusion , i strongly agree with the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .although a demographic explosion will occur particularly in china and in india , i am absolutely under the impression that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
[native] actually , i think our senate election system is even fairer :p http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electoral_system_of_australia#the_senate we 're about to get a whole lot of independents in because a lot of people hate the major parties - so people like the motoring enthusiasts party and australian sports party may hold a senate seat .
[native] actually , calling it a finest hour really is n't claiming that brits were objectively good and the germans were objectively bad in quite such simplistic terms , but it is saying that in relation to ww2 that britain was right to try and defeat the nazis .
[non-native] for their missions , these organizations send each year thousands of young people and young graduates from developped countries to acquire work experience but mostly to share their own knowledge by making the poor and needing people who live in much further communities taste a better and happier life .
[non-native] thus , i can conclude by saying that the younger lot do enjoy life a lot more than the older people do .for our grandmothers it was the flyers , for our parents it was the television and for us it is almost everywhere we exist .
[non-native] although the number of the inhabitants is so high , the extension of the territory that they occupe is very big , and the need of movement from one side to another of the city it is a real aspect we have to considerate .
[non-native] however , i prefer to travel with a group led by a tour guide for the reasons which i discussed above , and i beleive that this is the best way to travel with your family or friends because you wo n't enjoy only , but you will enjoy and benefit .some people say that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide beause of convenience and obtaining information by tour guide .
[non-native] many of the `` success stories '' one could heard about are mainly grounded on an invention , or on a risk taken : bill gates became the richer person in the word by creating microsoft windows , fosburry won all the high jump competitions by using `` fosburry '' technique . ..
[native] anyway , the breakfast food hit the bowl with a tinkle , i added just the right amount of milk and it was the split second the first spoonful hit my tongue that i woke up and realised i was eating dry cat food and we 'd run out of nutri-grain .
[native] i can imagine the eu referendum ending up with the uk staying and the pro-eu scots being like `` oh well that is all solved forever now , now time to dig up that other no vote because it 's been a couple of years and i think we need another vote ! ''
[non-native] i think we have to keep own wordthe issue that whether successful people need to try the risky thing to make their career success or jus do thing known wellis a complex and sensitive one , which onw people prefer depends one their personal experience family background and emotional concern .
[native] everyone in the uk from the tories to the lib dems support our claim to gibraltar because we did the decent thing , held an internationally observed referendum which even the eu agrees was won fair and square and now you 're moaning because people did n't vote the way you want .
[native] notice how there are many states in the south named after monarchs like georgia after one of the king georges , virginia after the ` virgin queen ' elizabeth i , carolina after charles ii , maryland after some queen or princess mary , and louisiana after one of the french king louis ' .
[non-native] however , as consumer , we realy need to pay attention to the money we spend and do not get fooled by the advertisement .there are many differences in the world from the way it was in the past , young people are one of those categories which were effected by the changes .
[non-native] in summary , even tought i agree with this statement , i would permit myself to correct it by chanching the fact that it is not successful people who try new things and take risks , but people who try new things and take risk in order to become successfull .
[non-native] in conclusion , i really think that a wild knowledge may increased people critical mind , but there are also advantages to be specialized .i disagree with the steatement because , in my opinion , it is better have a lot of knowledge about one specific subject , that to know only a little of many academic topics .
[non-native] if the students don , t know or don , t understand about something there are some solution to do like : they can ask their teacher or maybe they can seek or go to the internet it have alarge benifit informaion about any thing you want .
[native] in dublin its the northside thats shit , on the north side its ballymun/finglas in ballymun it used to be the towers if you went to the ballymun towers they would say one tower was the worst of them and i 'm sure if you went into that tower they would name a floor and on that floor would be a specific flat .
[native] also despite the daily mail claiming that the uk loses 75 % percent of cases against it in the echr , the reality is that the uk has one of the lowest rates of defeat before the court and that many cases that come before it are rejected as inadmissible .
[native] i 'm no expect , and this is just off the top of my head : * the european fishing industry would n't agree with your statement * it would add another nato member to the eu * geo-politically it would extend the eu reach to the north atlantic region above the arctic circle , which may not be a big deal now but if the predicted power race for the resources in the arctic kicks off it will matter a lot
[native] i draw the line at providing actual support - isis is a criminal organization so donating to them / buying their oil / otherwise providing some sort of support * that actually benefits them in a tangible way * is fair game for criminalization .
[native] [ kudrin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexei_kudrin ) was by most accounts an excellent finance minister who helped russia pay off much of the debt it had accumulated after the fall of the soviet union and was instrumental in russia coming out of the credit crunch relatively unscathed .
[non-native] it might be , that in big cities the number of cars may increase not that much , as the puplic transportation becomes more attractive , with increasing traffic jams on the streets , but it still seems convinient to the car drivers to wait in the traffic jam with his audio entertainment center , the meanwhile usual builtin internet acess than waiting at a freezy train station .
[non-native] but if you studay too much academic subjects maybe you will hard to find job , the reason is the boss in the company will think that you study too many different academic , you should not study them deeply , so they will not consider to use you at first .
[native] free education , housing , and other social services have been provided to the very impoverished and underprivileged in the us for many decades - not to the same cushy extent that it is in much of europe , but it 's there nonetheless .
[non-native] for my the perfect convination of learning from the facts and undertanding the concept , is the best path to a succeful learning process .there is an opinion that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
[native] > especially coming from a person of supposedly hispanic descent , you would at least think that you would be able to recognise that the african american , mexicano , coahuila , native american tribes and so on are all nationally distinct from white america .
[non-native] according to me , we the children till class eight should take all the subjects because it very neccessary to have a general knowledge of each subject but once we have reached to class nine then it is time to think about our future so it will be good if we concentrate in just one particular subject .
[non-native] in the end i would like to conclude that younger people enjoy life more than the older people as the resources and options available to older generation are limited .it is more important for the students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because they will make lot of invovations in the fields of sciences and technology .
[native] ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-ceuo1r4we ) back on the f-35 though ; the big difference between it 's system and that of the rafale 's or any other fighter 's is that with previous jets , the jet itself does n't 100 % know that the enemy aircraft is behind it , nor does the missile .
[native] from a philosophical perspective , the necessity of acting charitably to those in need is a first principle of morality according to perhaps the majority of philosophers and theologians throughout the centuries : augustine , locke , rousseau , alain , ratzinger , kant , peter singer ... there are substantial differences between their views but all of them share at least some notion of the necessity of assisting the other when one can ( there will be some small technical disagreements -- kant will justify such moral obligations with the notion of `` autonomy , '' singer with the so-called `` hard '' and `` soft '' principles ) .
[native] sounds like typhus , leishmaniasis , or factitious disease , esophageal rupture with a subsequent compartment syndrome , a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm , or pancreatitis caused by a gallstone , an enlarged spleen , extramedullary hematopoesis ( the production of blood cells outside the outside of the bone marrow ) , tuberculosis , brucellosis , lymphoma , or sarcoidosis .
[non-native] if in the area where they are going to biuld this new restaurant are some chiness , greek , or text mexican food , but they do not have a real mexican food , i think that the best thing they can do is started a restauran that it is not in this area .
[native] i agree that any murders are too many murders but you are implying all muslims have not reached this stage of `` maturity '' but we just do n't see muslim armies rising up in europe , so that does n't seem to be true .
[non-native] and since kids now are the future , the numbers of cars will grow for sure .from my personal experience and those of people around me , i strongly disagree with the opinion that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' .
[non-native] to give an order to this matter i think that first ( in a temporary order , not for its importance ) student need to learn the instruments they must use to observe facts , so in the first part of students formation is necessary for them to learm as much as possible about all theories and ideas which are the core of the metter and after they can understand and remember much more easely all facts connected with their study .
[native] it would be perfectly possible to unroll the sponge and scrape out the jam , which might be strawberry or raspberry , and to replace it with different jam taken from a second roly poly , perhaps a summer fruit compote or even orange marmalade ( although obviously you would n't want to use a thick cut variety as that would have lumps of peel poking out through the sponge ) .
[native] jews , who naturally do not want to be punished for breaking a law they will see as an attack on them and their identity , will therefore not bring their sons to doctors in the country for fear of being thrown in prison or having their kids taken from them .
[native] in some cases , putting emphasis on the `` no '' or the `` need '' may make it a qualified positive - `` we do n't need * no * education '' could be equivalent to `` we need less education , but not none ''
[non-native] we were born to make a difference in this world and by attaining mastery in one field of academia we can fulfill our duty to ourselves and humanity .the utmost intention of school lessons is to provide the pupil with the sufficient understanding and knowledge that they can make their way in the sometimes rough and high demanding world .
[non-native] but concepts are more important .eventhoug old generations has given a lot to their communities , as one of the young new generation i disagree with whom says that the young people is n't giving enough , there is more than one reason to this disagrement .
[native] in other words , business class and economy class in planes are `` identical in nearly every way '' , because everything that is in business class ( better food , more room , wifi ... ) just is n't enabled in the economy class .
[native] [ here 's an article ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/jobs/?site=tlse&amp;aid=47164#.uyeh1rvgckq ) talking about how it 's because of the racist tendencies of swedish people that prevent them from finding jobs ( nb i 'm not saying all , or even most swedes are racist , but there is a surprisingly high number of structural impediments to foreigners getting work here ) .
[non-native] on the one hand , people in north , western countries are getting more and more concerned with this pollution problem , and will try to find different ways to travel and move without the use of cars , such as public transport or walking .
[native] after 3 or so nights , the sam commander finally got a lock on the f-117 when it was ( iirc ) < 50km away and had it 's weapons bays open ; the f-117 was n't equipped with any radar warning equipment , so it had no idea it was being targeted and the awacs that was meant to provide this service was limited in it 's capabilities , meaning the sam had about 14 seconds to get a lock .
[non-native] by having knowledge on each subject he or she can settle in any type of field , that is if one subject 's booms is not there he or she can switch to another field whereas if we are specialize in one subject and that subject field is not in boom to get jobs and we ca n't switch to another field as easy as possible .
[non-native] in my opinion , we could n't and must n't continue to use and do what we already know how to do well and we have to follow the examples of our masters .marketing has evolved throughtout time and has become more complex as time pases .
[native] > goddamnit , and i wanted to travel and maybe even study a semester in the uk ( eurasmus and such ) , but i ca n't right now , and soon the uk might leave ... my expectation is that you wo n't have difficulties coming to the uk to study even after a brexit .
[native] > although washington took a back seat in the war , which the obama administration looked at skeptically from the start , the united states still ran the initial stages , in particular the destruction of libya 's air defenses , making it safe for its nato colleagues to fly .
[native] ukip is extremely pro-russian and anti-eu and are one of the main driving forces upon european disintegration in the uk , and there was also the foreign minister from the last german government ( i forget the name/affiliation tbh ) that sold out the baltic states for another russian gas pipeline ( and he 's considerably wealthier after the fact ) and there 's of course the supporting statements from parties all over europe for russia 's actions .
[native] lmao the situation in ukraine was in good part created by europe by waving the potential of eu membership in the ukranian people 's face , but when shit hit the fan , the eu pussied the fuck out , abandoned the ukrainian people & left the burden to america until we could rally you guys back to the defensive .
[native] the court ruled in brandenburg v. ohio that ; `` the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a state to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force , or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action . ''
[native] they quickly helped broker the brijuni accord , effectively helping to isolate slovenia from the conflict ( though in truth slovenia was a bit more of a sideshow anyway ) , and brought a quick , albeit very short lived , ceasefire to the area .
[non-native] and we all are responsibe about this , i mean that we must help the young people in everything that will make them take care of time to help their communities , because the young people can do everything better than the other people , and this is because they have a streangh and the power to do difficlt works .
[non-native] this is not only a good way of memorizing witout too mucch effort , but also a way of making the learning more engrossing .i agree that most advertisements really make products seem much better than the products really are , and that is why people make the advertisements for their products because they want to sell them for money .
[native] the idea being that users can post up stories , other users can make corrections , and if the author selects to accept a particular correction , the corrector will receive virtual money , which can then be spent in a game embedded on the site , or tipped to stories you 've enjoyed .
[non-native] my arguments do not only apply to the question of fewer or more cars , i thing it is easily applied to all kinds of modern technological goods like computers , televisions , mobiles and so on and i tstrongly believe that we have to be very careful to produce not only more and more of this goods but that we have to understand that fewer cars , laptops , machines of all kind , as suggested in the statement would actualy often be much better for all of us .i am agree with this statement .
[native] history has no shortage of examples of disorganized entities getting taken over by a united force - russia itself was conquered by the mongol horde because , at the time , it was only a smattering of bickering princedoms and republics - and the eu needs to avoid following suit .
[native] the idea that isds is secret is from the past , it bares no relation on the present as to ttip , these are basically some of the most transparent trade negotiations ever conducted , and the eu has published a tremendous amount of information online - that no one bothers to read .
[native] one of the main reasons i dislike the green party in europe is their opposition to this project , having tried to defund it a number of times in the past and wish to spend the money rather plastering the landscape with wind farms and solar .
[native] however i did n't realise it 's illegal to park on the grass beside the road , and since the road is a clearway heaps of people park up on the grass ... literally every single car parked on the grass got a $ 40 ticket , must have been about 20 cars in total .
[non-native] for example , when the history is examined , one can easly see that there were lots of mad scientists who dreamed lots of mad things including `` navigation in time '' , but if one looks at the results , there is nothing to applaude .
[non-native] i would like to conclude that be confidential in what ever we do then only we can succeed and be as inspiration to the next generation .yes , i agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take rather than doing what they already know how to do well .
[non-native] as a conclusion , given the fact that it is impossible to have and unpractical to aim for a broad knowledge in mathematics , it is even less desirable in general .i disagree that ` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are tody ' for the following reasons .
[native] the us was never going to get involved in a forceful way in the ukraine , and i ca n't help but feel somewhat that this article seeks to explain away as indifference a recognition that deep involvement was never a us option here .
[non-native] in conlusion , i believe that the goal of every professional is to achieve certain level of mastery or specialization on the very subject that gives passion to his/her life ; but , to acomplish so , it is crucial to acquire basic knowledge first that will provide the foundation for this development .the statment shown uses a perspective which shows that most products display the beasr features an item should have , so when the items displays a lesser capacity , the client that purchesed the item has complaints about it and complains with both the company he bought it from along with the advertizement which influenced the purchess .
[native] i went there expecting a sub about european heritage and culture , got a bunch of angry loons talking about immigration seriously though , i would like to find a place with discussion on european identity and heritage , a lot of people in my country of canada identify with a country but do n't actually understand much about it , they carry the flags on their car and around their homes , and cheer on their teams , just as the immigrants do , but most of them know little aboot their heritage and history
[non-native] in order to make an epoch and not only have a solid contribution to the social world we live in but also to be successful , people should be able to take risks and they should not be just depended on the subjects they already know .some people believe that , in about twenty years from now , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
[native] although the government has now made a policy of not reporting boat interceptions , so not sure how accurate the stats may be - for us it was never really that large of a problem , europe faces far greater numbers than we had .
[non-native] so , we can say after this explaination , that there wo n't be fewer cars in twenty years from now , but instead , more cars , and even more efficient cars .on my own opinion , i do agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what thay already know how to do well .
[native] or that if you read how they came their conclusion their definition of what constitutes a fundamentalist is a bit flimsy : > two thirds of the muslims in western europe say that religious rules are more important to them than the laws of the country i 'm sure the same can be said about a huge proportion of christians that you would never describe as fundamentalists , that is to say it does n't mean every one of them want to impose sharia law .
[non-native] this is only an esample to show how facts , in my idea are much more important to understand than ideas and concepts also because if you learn much more better the facts , from them , you will reiceive also the ideas and concepts that are unified to them .in my oppinion , i agree young people nowadays do not have enough time to helping their communities .
[non-native] but it is a tendency that we have to further , especially in poorer countries , by explaining how necessary it is and maybe helping them financially to build public infrastructures that could replace the use of cars .i agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
[native] they could be sunni muslims ( i.e. , non-minority in most of syria and likely no persecution ) only leaving because they 're sick of the fighting around them , or they could be some minority who is not leaving because of bullets and shelling , but instead is scared of `` insert group here '' taking over their town/city ( hence persecution ) and the ramifications thereof .
[native] 10,000 , then all votes over that number are marked as surplus votes and go to the candidate set as 2 on their preference list until that candidate is elected at which point it would go to 3 , then when this is done the weakest candidate is eliminated and the second preferences of that candidates votes and transferred , this continues until all the seats are filled .
[native] and unfortunately , once you allow vassal states to determine their destiny , then it is n't hard to argue that a soviet republic should be allowed to as well , and at that point there is no way to keep the baltics , then the whole union is in jeopardy .
[native] each country is suppose to spend 2 % on their military ( most dont ) but if you group all the eu nations together the new eu army will likely make that 2 % figure but it would be an insane downgrade from what it is now .
[non-native] in my opinion , the people that make those advertisements not only have a gap in the knowledge of about the characteristics of the product , but also they have a good knowledge about how to use secret messages that makes the product essay to sell .
[native] [ ireland ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/irish_general_election_2011.png ) the main political parties here are : [ fianna fáil ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fianna_f%c3%a1il ) the republican party ( center-right ) [ fine gael ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fine_gael ) a republican party ( center-right ) [ labour ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/labour_party_\ ( ireland \ ) ) republican socialist party ( center-left ) [ sinn féin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sinn_f%c3%a9in ) extreme republican party ( left-wing ) in ireland you vote republican or republican , it has a lot to do with our history .
[non-native] as a conclusion i think that when we look at advertised product we should do it with criticism and be aware of the differences between pictures and real life .it is a general opinion that youngsters do not give enough of their time in helping their communities .
[non-native] unless , you are happy with this situation , this wo n't be a problem , but in my case this would be a disaster , because i always think the way of getting better until the perfection and i think that is the feeling that moves the world .
[non-native] for example , i traveled to south africa four years ago and i traveled with a group of people who were from different counties and the person who were taking us in the tour teached us every thing about that place and teached us what is the best way to commiunicate with the people there .
[native] but that 's just the past , i 'm talking about now and your policy of appeasement , which has a very striking similarity to a certain historical figure by the name of neville chamberlain , who 's policies , if i recall my history , allowed another man named adolf hitler , to freely annex neighbouring countries and ultimately lead to world war ii .
[native] when the band started to break up paul took control ( you can see it start around revolver/sgt peppers , but exasperated later on as they grew apart as individuals ) because the band was aimless and he was able to provide a direction .
[non-native] hence , in sum , i would like to reassert my position after stating the above points that there might be fewer cars in use in the next twenty years than they are today .nowadays is a lot of disccusion about what is more important in the process of learning in the students , we have two possible answers : the first one is to understand ideas and concepts , and the second one is to learn facts .
[native] you have literally slammed me on * every single one of my comments * ... it 's almost as if you have some kind of agenda ... and looks like you have a whole fucking brigade of brownshirts downvoting me and leaving slanderous comments , meh , you 're just giving me a platform to advertise myself sooooo , keep it up , dick head !
[native] unlike us , the united states * is * a country that receives many millions of uneducated , unskilled illegal migrants -- a conservative estimate is 11 million , far more than what europe is taking in this year -- and yet those migrants have been consistently found to bolster the u.s. economy ( see sources : [ [ 1 ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/magazine/do-illegal-immigrants-actually-hurt-the-us-economy.html ) ] [ [ 2 ] ( https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/immigration/news/2013/02/08/52377/immigrants-are-makers-not-takers/ ) ] [ [ 3 ] ( http://www.cfr.org/immigration/economic-logic-illegal-immigration/p12969 ) ] [ [ 4 ] ( http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/reality-check-do-undocumented-immigrants-benefit-the-us-economy--285125561.html ) ] [ [ 5 ] ( http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/foreign-policy/203984-illegal-immigrants-benefit-the-us-economy ) ] ) .
[non-native] nowadays , on my opinion , there are really too much young people who do n't spend their time to help their communities due to the fact that they have some other thing to think and do like games or dancing , etc.but , for me , those are not so important than help you peer .
[non-native] considering the need for oil on the planet and the fact this natural resource is a limited one , either the number of cars will have to decrease ( for there will soon be no more fuel to run them ) or there will be new inventions in the field of motor vehicles ( such as hybrid or solar cars ) .
[non-native] so if you see a great huge sculpture done by the ancient egyptians you have to think about it not to only enjoyit ` like whey the artist coosed thies stone color and why he suuorted the back with arectagler stone that will migt lead to a new sculpture of yours using the sanme stone colr but with an abestrsct shape'to begin with , i do not agree with the statement which is exposed .
[native] that 's awesome , i 'm happy for you :) i 've never really hated my male equipment in a dysphoric way ( being into chicks kinda helped i guess ) , but at the same time i ca n't really express myself sexually with it either as i 'm not very dominant lol ! . .
[non-native] what i strongly believe in taking risks will give you an opportunity to change and there is actually a saying in venezuela `` el que no arriesga , no gana '' that means , `` the one that do n't risk , wo n't win '' .
[native] '' * by culture he is alluding to the slow drift from religious christianity to nominal christianity , a shift that is plain to see across the whole of europe , from going to church every sunday to only going on christmas eve , if ever .
[non-native] my advise for all young people it 's to feel responsabilty and trying to not weasting time in some thing not deserv .in classes , students learn not only the facts but also the `` ideas '' or `` concepts '' that can be pulled out from the fact .
[non-native] to sum up , because of external effects including insensitive parents , television and computer games and internal effects consist of competition and wanting more money can make young people do not give enough time and effort to helping their communities .i agree with the statement that , in twenty years , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
[non-native] then `` yours is the world and everything that 's in it , and which is more , you will be a man , my son '' .younger and older people have differnt ways to live their lifes but it seems to me that younger people can enjoy their way of living more than older people can .
[native] i do n't believe this was synchronised but then again not that long ago if you 'd told me that there 's a gigantic worldwide surveillance network dedicated to spying on its citizens operating under our noses , i would have mocked you relentlessly .
[non-native] the main and most important reason i have to defend my opinion is that in twenty years the popullation would growth a lot , and not only in africa where the birth-index is enormous also in europe and in all america , and this is going to occur because of the inmigration , it could be legal or illegal , but all the countries are going to suffer the inmigration and migration proccess , instead of the laws and other inpediments governments will try .
[non-native] in order to make the trip better , it is better to traval by my own plan without a tour guide .in my opinion succesfull people ca n't be mesured by the quantity of risks they take , because a man that does not take any risk and focuses on doing what he knows he does very well , can be as succesful as a man that focuses only in taking risks and trying to experiment with new thing everyday .
[non-native] people start to use or consume products for their temporary benefits such as reduced fee for mobile phones for a limited campaign period but after that `` path dependence '' is created among the consumers and people are used to using that product , all of the temporary benefits are removed .
[native] even there , russia is n't even a majority exporter to the eu of o&g , so i do n't think it 's suggesting moving to an american dependence at all but rather to reorient europe away from russian energy and proposing the us as an alternative .
[native] > breshnev was pushing for a political solution the whole time , but had to give in to military hardliners and the pressure of the soviet satellites to intervene * `` if i had not voted for soviet armed assistance to czechoslovakia you would not be sitting here today , but quite possibly i would n't either .
[native] interestingly , my 16 year old brother had a bad trip on mushrooms , but after that he was completely changed as a person , he started doing better in school and became more determined to be successful in life , before this he just drank and smoked weed and bummed around with his stoner mates .
[non-native] in the developed countries that are already at a stage where there is a car for every individual ( adult ) and the pollution and traffic is at their peak there would be awareness about the vehicular pollution and trafic discomfort that leads to citizens opting to other cost effective and environmental freiendly modes of transort like the public transport system , metros , busses etc. that will surely reduce the use of the personal cars .
[native] obviously all the issues we try to discuss are insanely complex and multifaceted , but i do think it makes sense that spending money on society at the cost of corporate profits is better for society than * cutting * social spending in favour of corporate profits ( which only looks good on paper once you 've ignored all the social problems this causes ) .
[native] i certainly do n't think these proposed reforms are a good idea , but if the rationale is to keep the uk in the eu , and to make it the favoured destination for multinationals , then i think they 'd be very effective reforms , and given the tory dogma that a rising tide lifts all boats , i think they believe they 've got the uk 's best interests at heart .
[native] * [ battlestar galactica ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0407362/ ) -- ( 2004 ) when an old enemy , the cylons , resurfaces and obliterate the 12 colonies , the crew of the aged galactica protects a small civilian fleet - the last of humanity - as they journey toward the fabled 13th colony of earth .
[native] this exact same ` poll ' you linked ( from an . org.ua host ... which has a special `` reintergration of donbass and crimea '' website section ... ) whose biases i would * never * question shows that > 42.2 percent of donbas residents want to stay in ukraine .
[native] those preferences will translate into votes for an exit if voters can be convinced that there 's nothing to lose in an exit , because if there 's no cost to something then you might as well go with exactly what you want , no matter how little you want it .
[native] my only fear is what parasite is going to replace him and who 's going to form the new government , because frankly i despise all fianna fáil , fine gael , labour and sinn féin , though if i were to take any of them it 'd be the shinners .
[native] since they are located mostly in the middle of cities and i live in a suburb it 's hard to imagine even one lives here , but i bet if you go to the middle of downtown cincinnati or something you 'd see a few and be like omg they 're taking over the country !!
[native] there were 3 german bombers in the air , oh there were 3 german bombers in the air oh there were 3 german bombers 3 german bombers 3 german bombers in the air and the raf from england shot one down and the raf from england shot one down and the raf from england the raf from england raf from england raf from england shot one down there were 2 german bombers in the air ...
[non-native] besides , that is a statement that i have been debateing with myself lately becacuse i am at one step to enter to the university , and i had to choose whether a carrier that contains knowledge of many sbujects , such as international relationshiops ( i. r ) , or to choose one with more specific information .
[native] one is the attempt to solve the crisis through communication policy -- which is what we are doing now , with a banking union that excludes any form of joint liability , or with endless protestations that the crisis is over or that the eurozone is recovering .
[native] they pretty much view themselves , and by extention him , as a victim who is handling an unreasonable and expansionist western world with finesse and strength , which fits into the russian narrative very well as they 've been a powerful nation for the last few hundred years with the exception of after the collapse of the ussr where they were very very weak , and russians did not handle this well .
[native] * access to the public has changed , it is easy to sneer at social media , but the ability for like-minded people dissatisfied with their government to band together and organise is a huge change from information being on control of the print and tv media .
[native] ** tl ; dr germany is using it 's influence to help weaken & drain much of the eurozone to it 's own benefit , america came out of the recession in 2009 & recovered all the ground it lost by 2012 , the eurozone on the other hand had a double-dip recession which it only came out of last year and it 's still is faced with stagnant growth while being on the verge of deflation ** what the fuck are you talking about ?
[native] he stated an explicit method of assaulting councillors under specified circumstances in retaliation for a specific government policy , as well as spreading defamatory statements ( basically : they 're all here to rape our women ) that could open the population in question up to hatred and contempt .
[non-native] for example , it is claimed about a football shoes that it can not be dirt because of its clothes but if the cloths of the shoes like this why it is not said to me that its color may be changed in times .
[non-native] trying new things is in some ways like betting : maybe you do n't know wether you 'll win or not , but anyway your duty is to be in the best condition to risk , and then to prepare to acknowledge the result .
[native] i 'm really more of the mind that it 's the chef and what he does though ; i 'm not sure if the stuff that heston blumenthal comes out with traditionally counts as british cuisine , but that 's definitely what it is , and that shit is * godlike .
[native] hi mr corbett - as someone that 's spent a lot of time researching the topic of isds ( and probably too much time arguing about it on reddit ) , most of my questions will relate to that can you elaborate on what you see as so egregious with isds ?
[native] also , i was just looking at the demographics of some european countries and it seems that a few like ireland , slovakia , russia and ukraine have birthrates being the highest in around 2 decades , so i guess the trend is reversible .
[native] the eu is not in the road to a deliberately federal europe - all the moves that people see as `` federalising '' are federalising only in that they involve working together , and are only made because it makes sense to work together in that area .
[non-native] i hope that later people will start to change theyr habits and money will be not the main target of our life in order to use mor pubblic transportation or different kind of energies .nowadays , a lot of students waste time to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because of several reasons .
[native] some context : [ this graph represents the lack of information due to the media black out on the topic in 2013 , also this list everyone that has died on their way to australia and in immigration detention centres ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-23/government-won27t-reveal-when-boats-turned-back/4975742 ) the australian border deaths database is n't a government database but a private one run by monash university in melbourne , based on what information they can find .
[native] so to get this straight , you 're fine with constrianing the uk economy by not having enough skilled people coming to work , you 're fine with not accepting people for humanitarian protection , and you 're fine with people not having their wife/kid/whatever coming over ?
[non-native] it true with case of selling cosmetic to the consumer , likewise manufacture many time take help of celebrity of filmstars to attract the consumer , but consumer always use the product they trust they trust the product with their experience of their past use of many time media paly vital role where they discuss many ongoing topic where they help consumer to make best choices through available option .
[non-native] everyone shoud enjoy but also old people shoud support them .i agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well because successful people are full of confident that what ever field or work thier choose in that they can do well .
[non-native] in conculsion , the variety of knowledge results in people to have wider understanding and way of thinking by the background of many academic subjects people study in schools .academic studies are made for human being , every research should take the science one step further .
[native] my point is n't that british ( i 'm assuming you mean anglo-saxon here ) people do n't preserve british culture , my point is that a brit 's skin color being anything other than white does n't inherently or automatically mean that they wo n't or ca n't preserve british culture .
[non-native] hence successful people always believe in doing things in unconventional ways wherein they dare to face all challenges that come in their way .in a modern society , people always face the dilemma of whether having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than having specialized knowledge in one specific subject .
[native] class one cucumbers can be easily packaged - you can have a tray of ten on the bottom layer , ten on the middle layer , ten on the top layer for efficiency in packaging and selling ( not to mention ease of use at the final destination , such as if they need them straight for processing ) .
[non-native] a problem with making produkts ` shine ' is that these untruth information should not be too extreme because this leads to a bad picture of the producing company and the people that had made a wrong decision because they beliefed in the advertisement are not willing to buy future products of that company making things better is a normal way of selling but the suggested information of the advertisement should not be so far away from the truth because this will not help you in the future .in any kind of educative , teaching , or learning institution , there are many ways in which classes ( specifically academic ) are imparted .
[non-native] older people have already experience what was like to be young and wild , to have fallen in love or have their heart 's been broken , while the young are those willing learners wanting to experience life at its fullest , simply because it is their time to wild , being allowed by their young bodies to do so .
[non-native] for example , yesterday , i needed the desk lamp to study my major hard , and at first , i read the information about the lamp which i can buy from internet , and at next i looked in the phamphlet to get day before yesterday , when i went to the shop .
[non-native] for example , they ca n't do hard sports that move around lot , they ca n't travel as much as the youngers and lots of ather things and what they can do is like sleep , have some walk , have a chat with freinds , stay home and somethings like that .
[non-native] in our daily live we are recieving lots and lots of information or advertisements from every where we go or we are , for example if we switch on the television we see advertisements , if we are on the road we see advertisements on the sides of the road . ..
[native] > however , that 's not what most people want , and nobody in portugal is even worried about it , but i guess we 're very different from the rest of the world then why did so many people vote for anti austerity and anti eu parties ?
[native] the guy might be a warmongering prick , but there 's no indication that he 's suicidal or anything ; he 's not going to put himself into a situation where russia has to fight an enemy which might be able to fight back .
[native] they 're concealed by the use of english and the fondness of the irish for uk imports , but the irish are nothing like the english , and the english person who acts as if they are will be repeatedly baffled by the irish until he either learns better or concludes that the irish are mad .
[non-native] the reason i would disagree is because there are companies like macdonalds that do not need the advertisements to sell their products , but they use them because the competition is huge , and they need their consumers to confirm why they are the best .
[native] yet , without good proxies of those costs and the scope for their reduction , an empirical economic analysis with proper modeling is basically impossible or mere sophisticated ` guess ' work . '' yet , at the same time , while the cepr study rules out the ability to forecast `` net employment creation or destruction '' , it does capture the `` reallocation of workers '' in a post-ttip eu , admitting that it is likely to bring `` prolonged and substantial '' dislocation to european workers as a result of its impact on different sectors : '' . . there will be sectors that will be shedding workers and that the reemployment of these workers in the expanding sectors is not automatic . . '' ( section 5.9.2 ) http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2013/march/tradoc_150759.pdf further analysis on this point by john hilary of war on want : http://www.thebrokeronline.eu/blogs/employment/ttip-don-t-mention-the-job-losses ` the cepr study calculates the level of displacement that ttip will bring to employment , cited as a percentage of the labour force in the eu and us .
[non-native] an example : my grandmother bougth a radio , that she had seen on a newspaper , and when she recived it , by mail , she realized that it did n't work .i strongly disagree with this statement , as i do not see why it would be correct .
[non-native] you have to be competent and self confident in your topic , so you can use the proper knowledge and the necessary skills you need in order to respond to a critic during a public assesment or evaluation , or reach an objective such us fulfill a research project or preparing lectures for the classes .
[non-native] therefore i conclude that by studying various academic subjects people can really enhance their knowledge and can be a great value and asset to a company in which they are working .i t very important for the education systems to theach qualified and students but a conflict will occur when a teacher choose her/him teacing tools .
[non-native] from my point of view facts are not so important if you don ' t have the instruments for analysing them , and the instruments are given by ideas and concepts : understanding the `` abstract '' ideas gives students the tools for facing reality and learning facts , otherwise they would not get anything of what they are reading , for examples on history books , which are the places where you can mostly find `` facts '' .
[native] when the majority of a population is not capable of being fully informed on both sides of an issue , or even capable of recognizing there are even two sides to an issue , why would you want that same majority dictating how you live your life ?
[native] despite their being fictitious people , - a so called `` legal fiction '' used to allow them to be sued and sue , corporations , although composed of people are not living things , nor are they human , therefore to give them human rights as if they were , is a very big mistake . )
[native] i think in the case of the uk , the reality is ( for a range of historical reasons ) you would never have got the consent of the people , so i do not think the uk would ever have been part of it .
[native] i think this is quite true , when a russian politician said we were a small island of the coast of europe and nothing more it was widely reported and david cameron ( our prime minister ) came out and said it was a load of bollocks .
[non-native] in my openion , i think that being a successfull person need much effort than every one thinks and in rder to be success you have to take more riks than ordinary people .i believe that it is better for people to have broad understanding of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject because a wide scope of knowledge in various academic subjects is required for multi-tasking , for maturing into a knowledgeful person , and for conducting specific tasks efficiently .
[non-native] if a finalized , perfect travel has to be accomplished , one has to collect all the information one needs and starts the unmasking discovery adventure not just paying lots of money and have to waiting for the buses in the morning and later found out that someone has troubles with the payment and the schedule is delayed .
[native] a more multiculturalism australia maybe the eu could invest in that elusive high-speed train along the east coast ... c'mon guys competing in eurovision things that worry me : lack of a fiscal union in the eu eu commission ( which drafts legislation for the eu parliament , and not the other way round like it should be ) not being an elected body , making the eu a largely technocratic construct .
[native] he traveled there openly after the us government spoke to yanukovych ( remember , they were trying to end the protests and keep him in charge , but with a pro-eu stance at the time -- the us vice president even called him over this ) .
[native] if i want to sow a traditional wheat cultivar , a `` gmo '' wheat cultivar , and an entirely new plant ( say , from china , that has never been grown here before ) , it makes no sense to vet the `` gmo '' wheat more strictly than the new plant .
[non-native] another example , if you want to go to a campus and some of your friends aked you a question about a lesson , attitude , anything else you will not be able to answer him a good answer unless if you know it as an idea or a concept .
[non-native] so , the young people 's involvement to help their community is highly dependent on the time which they can take aside for such service excluding their essential activities .the most common idea of marketing is `` to sell the product at any cost '' .
[non-native] finally , by attending a group led by a tour guide who have many experiences about the tour , i will get a lot of knowledge and information from the knowledgeable tour guilde and from group members who have many information i have never known .
[non-native] in conclusion i agree with the statement , and in twenty years , i think that we 'll must leave our loved and hated car in garage .it is stated by some that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
[non-native] i dont think there is any better definition to the word `` self satisfaction '' than this .i believe that an engineer or a medical doctor , or any academic person should have a basic background of many academic subjects related to his or herscientific interests .
[native] when you imply i 'm a chickenshit coward who does n't care about europe when i 'm adamant about increasing american military presence in eastern europe , defending non-nato eu member-states like finland or sweden and upping aid , both military & civil , to ukraine , as well as advocating intelligence sharing & assistance * ( even if that means cia black ops ) * .
[non-native] the first , about the respect for other people , can be inferred , for example when youngs often smile about other people 's desease ; it happens to see an old woman in difficult to cross the street and near her a group of adolescents , looking at her ; well , it is really unusual seeing them helping her to bring the bags or simply to cross the street .
[non-native] the most clear example of the statement are the advertisements of diet systems : they are exposed like some kind of miracoulous thing that , while we are continuing to live our life , can make us lose a lot of weight without any physical effort , and often they have no effects or collateral effects on the users , attracted by an easy way to improve theirselfs .
[non-native] the ladder of success changes people in many ways , as they take the first step people are willing to take risks and try out new things ; but as their journey progresses they develope a new mentality which is built on past innovative , dynamic , and fruitfull experiences thus paving the way for a more conservative and limited mentality .let me begin by stating that during your studies at university , for instance in economics , you will get courses , which contain a lot of theoretical content and it 's hard to understand and remember all those different theories from famous scientists or managers etc. for your final exams .
[non-native] on the one hand , i tend to think that an employee deserves the right to be considered as a successful person to the extent that they previously had to prove educated and motivated enough to meet the employer 's requirements for a specific position within a company .
[non-native] atlast i would say that specializing in one subjects makes you a testimony in public for the same and it leads to a secure future becuse you are sure of what you want to do and you dont mislead others with wrong or inaccurate information .today man 's dependence on automobiles is very much and will increase in the future .
[native] that said , and just in case you were n't aware , they have no power to compel countries to enact/repeal laws - they can only claim financial compensation , or if the parties choose to settle instead the government may choose to repeal the law for there to be a smaller payment .
[non-native] i now feel that it is resposibility of individuals to protect themselves from falling into the trap that companies lay to extract money from consumers by advertising .i completly agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
[native] there were horrible deportations of hundreds of thousands of eastern europeans to siberia , almost all of whom died , in the era between russia 's annexation of the baltics and hitler , and then , of course , hitler killed millions of eastern europeans and then , after he was defeated , and after the war the slaughter resumed .
[non-native] altrough , sometimes is difficult to travel is a group led by a tour guide , people have to , because it presents many advantages that travel alone without and tour guide .in my opinion , young people today do not dedicate enough time to helping their communities .
[non-native] if hundreds of years ago a crazy guy would n't have taken the risk and tried finding a different route to get by ship to india we would probably still be living in trees and hunting animals to obtain food and the rest of the world would still believe the earth is n't round .
[native] here 's a perfectly peaceful situation in which you may have to pay more money for a service you are being provided ( incidentally because of government created and maintained monopolies ) but your response is to advocate for the violence of the state to strong-arm a better deal for you ?
[non-native] if a person is not specialized in any subject , and he has a broad knowledge of all the subjects , he wo n't be able to recognize the subjects of his interest , and he might end up doing a job from which he might not get enough satisfaction .
[non-native] when i graduated with a computer engineering degree , i did not go routinely to search for an it or engineering job , but instead , i jumped into a very new field called `` bioinformatics '' by spending another two years in graduate schools for a master degree .
[non-native] the first thought is maybe that young people like children or teenagers could be enjoying their lives more than older people do , because they do n't have to care about such a lot things like their parents , like paying the bills , shop some food , going to work etc .
[native] let 's face the reality that if we continue to see increasing gdp as the be-all and end-all of human endeavours , we 'll see increasing level of suffering and misery while the global elite continue to scoop up the vast amounts of wealth which ultimately is the direct result of the efforts of wage earners over the past couple of hundred years .
[non-native] enjoyment of young people are mostly extravagent show , full of materialism , lewdfullness , levish parties that all show the adrenaline running in their vessels , it also lighten the impatince bound with the age concern , on other side enjoyment of geriatric person solemnly starts and and in spiritualism .
[non-native] on the other hand in addition to that , it is often said that within new methods of teaching , it would be really more important for students to understand the ideas and concepts because if you once understand something you will be able to keep it longer than if you learn it by heart .
[non-native] for example if we consider scientist `` albert einstein '' who concentrated only in physics and produced great equation ( e = mc2 ) which is basis for famous princlple `` theory of relativity '' .which is used in all nuclear reactions , to measure the relative velocity between to moving objects ...
[native] i live in a part of the country where there are loads of poles , romanians , balts etc and practically the first thing anyone says about them is how hard they work - no one objects to these people but there are also a substantial number who have no intention of supporting themselves .
[non-native] they are taking risks every day to save people , they have a heavy training during many months , and if they do n't succeed to do one task , they will be asked to do it again and again , sometimes in some extreme conditions .
[native] it 's a pretty stupid thing to say on the ( presumably former ) diplomat 's part , but the waters are muddied when people insist ( as many israelis on the right , centre and centre-left in israel do ) on defining israel as an explicitly jewish state .
[non-native] i may have proven formulas that have worked for me all my life and that not necessarily make me a succesful person in terms of money and fame , but in my own reference terms , that could be anything regarding a good quality of life , or even not simply that .
[non-native] like for any medical subject student , who from his textbooks and through his teachers learn various aspects and ideas for medical practise but his basic and important learning would based on how he works in the hospitals , by checking the original disease affected bodies .
[native] yes , because the first thing we want to see happen in a new multi-polar world centered on asia , where a rising china is to be our greatest competitor , is to once again divert the majority of our focus & resources * away * from the pacific , and back to europe to bolster a divided european union vulnerable to russian aggression/influence .
[non-native] therefore i would have to disagree with this statement , i just ca n't see cars just vanishing like that in two decades , twentry years is not a long time , however i agree with the fact the cars will be less efficient then wut the were in the twenith centuraryi agree with this sentence , especially after the increasing of different ways to sell a product .
[native] i cringe thinking back on it now , how much worry and work it must have caused my poor mum , who phoned the school to tell them i could n't come in , and helped me get dressed ( for some reason it was easy to just completely not move my legs all day - i just had to remember the leg cramps and tell myself that if i moved my legs , i 'd get cramps again ) , and took me in my old pram around the shops with her for the day .
[native] people wonder why nuland said * `` fuck the eu '' * , but it 's because the eu basically helped create this whole thing by wanting to expand east , but when the shit hit the fan the eu collapsed into itself thanks to member-states ' diverging interests leaving the burden on america 's shoulders .
[native] > i once sat on a boat tour through prague listening to an american guy try and impress this american women by loudly slagging off the whole of europe , saying you 'd see more culture going from california to kentucky than you would travelling across europe , how it was overrated etc etc.
[native] it 's not some organized religion like catholicism , there is no standard interpretation as laid out by the church , and there has n't been since the fall of the ottoman empire and dissolution of the caliphate ( which correlated with a marked rise in extremist islam , i might add ) .
[non-native] therefore i would like to strongly state that though a student should be taught facts but there is no way that the students can do without an understanding of concepts or grasping of ideas .as the countries of the world progress into the 21st century , the ever-increasing complexities have yet again slapped the question of time-management on the face youngsters today .
[native] in other words , immigrants to the us pay far * more * into the system than they take out and they add a huge amount to the economy -- not to mention they do extremely well and do n't end up in slums .
[non-native] in conclusion , it depends on your conscience to lie to your customers or not , i agree that most advertisements make prodcuts seem mcuh better than they really are ; however , due to the reason i stated above , this kind of a marketing strategy just serves to what it is supposed to , if i would be an advertiser and meet a case like this one , i totally go with ` lying to the customer and doing the best for my company` , besides , i would not be offended as a mere customer and not feel betrayed by the company i trust .the author asserts that the young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
[non-native] in addition , if the student achieves a goal about that topic by understanding it , he will be happy to be successful .when we are asked if it 's better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects then to specialize in one specific subject we reach a great problem .
[non-native] well what do i sugget is that the parent talk to there chldrin and give them the vedio games on the weakends or holly dayssince beginning of my prep-school education , our teachers tried to teach every thing from different areas , for example we had math course , music course and also a drawing course .
[non-native] on the other hand , as what is being put into discussion is not the nature of advertisement itslef , it would be fair enough to acknowledge the way propaganda is meant to be and proceed to reason not on the essence , but on the form of the problem .
[native] \ \ o / and a bit of googling seems to show up all * sorts * of opinions on how and where to prune an apple ... so i will roll with your opinion , i reckon - since , you know what else you seem to be ?
[non-native] the guide plan every single detail in order to satisfy customer needs and tries always to prepare information regarding the place where people are going , even if is a long or short trip , a guide with his or her skills will provide with a good plan to cover the most interesting things and places to see during these days his best effort will be reflected in tips from people .
[non-native] sometimes i have the impression that 24 hours a day are not enough to do all even if you are a really organized person ( lessons in the morning , study in the afternoon , extra class in the evening , gym after class ...
[native] without the constant threat of allied invasion , the raf 's relentless battering of german air power , and industry , and pressing against the western front when they did invade to divide germany 's forces and war effort in half , russia would have been overrun .
[non-native] to begin with , the most important reason to support my view is that new things always means high profit , in another word i mean new things although have much more risk than those things already known well , they can give the people more money and the oppertunities to success .
[native] > i would be open to better relations , increased freedom of movement , and less restrictions on trade with canada , australia and new zealand based on the fact that they are highly industrialised nations with as much to offer the eu as we have to offer them .
[native] in a very noble and gratifying sense i feel as though it would be the best way to transition out of the post , as clearly , it has no place in a modern democracy for no other reason than what the title implies .
[non-native] they persist to achieve their goals and sometimes people need to take risks because we can not win something big if we do not make sacrificies or assume risks .i do not agree with the statement that most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are .
[non-native] even enjoying life is not basically age determined , there are also situations on wich a person may have a tremendous physical or phsycological impediment that may result on being torn apart from the rejoycing of life , but even among these people once someone told me about a story where two sick people are on the same hospital room , but just one got the opportunity to see trough the window , so everyday , the one that had no possibility to see trough the window asked the other one to tell him about what was happening on the outer world .
[native] > if there would be a book about shitty allies , israel would be somewhere in there along with italy ... considering usas dealings in the middle east for the last decade and half , and any lack of contribution that israel put forward ... yeah its not that great eh , israel earned their keep during the cold war - very important that they also made peace with egypt which kept the suez canal open for international trade to expand .
[non-native] to conclude , i would say that both kinds of knowledge are important , but having to choose , i would go for specializing in one subject over having broad knowledge of many subjects , because it is more important when it comes to being a good proffesional , whatever career you choose .this statement is actually a question that people already do in this particular moment with more frecuency than in the past .
[native] if they are * economic * migrants , then they can apply for a permit to enter and live in the uk legally , while being subject to the proper immigration process the united kingdom does n't want france to be their `` right hand '' , they just want france to actually do something about what 's happening * on their shores * .
[native] she would not , we can be confident , have been made privy to privatisation plans , as she would not then be able to stand over the company 's claim that it can not be sold - and there 's no doubt that her statement was made in good faith .
[non-native] depending on the task that has to be done an specialist will be better or worst than a person with a broader knowlegde .as students start off in college , during your undergraduate years they experience the broad spectrum of knowledge , they take courses from different departments , such as : english , spanish , mathematics , social sciences , arts , etc .
[native] i also had to see a govt psychiatrist for about 5 sessions ( so they know i 'm not going to kill myself , checking i 'm absolutely sure i know what i 'm doing etc ) , she was * amazing * , was so professional and nice but unbiased .
[non-native] maybe the sense of community will , in the years to come , be redifined to be adapted to a more modern world , and to different ways of thinking and acting .old temples , beautiful japanese trees , and traditional japanese snacks and food .
[non-native] if the actual trend of the world will hold , it can be asserted that it will take more than twenty years for the number of cars to start decreasing , if it will ever do so .some people prefer to know academic knowledge broadly .
[non-native] once the campany askde him to sell numbers of air conditions , he was very happy about the good selling in north because of the cold , so he went to south of china to sell them , but he sold none at last since the south of china remain 25 degree all of the year .
[non-native] but unless we will have prefect knowledge in al lthe subject we will not settled for example if a person whoes specilisation is communication he should have software knowledge also why bacause it will provide much jobs and we will be verry use full inorder to well settled .
[native] considering that the distinctions asia , europe and the middle east are merely political/social/racial distinctions and not geographic ( by the most logical definition of continents , they are all part of the continent of eurasia ) , and that turkey has been interested in applying to join the european union and the reason for them not being accepted was due to them not meeting human rights goals not them not being within the ill-defined borders of europe , and considering that is/isis/isil has many members who were born and raised in european countries , i think it is at least partially relevant .
[native] as an irish person while we have little or no say currently i feel under a supranational government we 'd just be forgotten about and you 'd essentially have a situation that exists in the uk whereby scottish , welsh and northern irish votes are essentially meaningless in westminster elections .
[non-native] not only does it teach about a historical aspect or a specific condition in the country or city , but it also gives the people the opportunity to live within what they are learning , and to actually be able to see , feel and even touch what they are learning about .
[native] > however , you could argue that dutch immigration policy has become stricter because of fortuyn 's influence , and these days it 's easy for political parties to win votes by saying they will limit the number of immigrants - although in practice , we have european laws for that .
[non-native] so , the person will do alot of things like finishing his work , then having time to study , after that he will have the time to see his parents , relatives , and friends and ofcourse he will be able of doing any thing with them , as what i had observed and saw from my friend .
[native] that they were friendly , immensely helpful ( one of them , an aquaintance of my ex , once drove me to the hospital on only the second time i 'd met him and waited around with me for the four hours i was there ) , and that they should in no way be judged by what a few dickheads do .
[non-native] to recapitulate , taking into accounts all the dimensions of the issues discussed in the aforementioned analyses , which sometimes correlate with each other to generate a comprehensive and thus more convincing conclusion , i safely draw the attention that not only can older people be aware of the life quality , but also they are more easily satisfied what they have .
[native] yes , and you can see a lot of bethesda fans disliking fnv , because `` it did n't have the atmosphere '' or `` the world was empty and/or the exploration was n't as good '' or `` it was n't so epic '' .
[native] they tried to push this when i was in school , they had a new word each week for immigrants when the last one was suddenly deemed derogatory out of nowhere , i do n't think they ever even bother talking to immigrants when they come up with this shit .
[native] one of the dozen or so reasons given for deleting at least 70 % of the posts on them is `` not us news '' if it refers to ttip , the people in / r/politics and / r/news insist that / r/europe is the only place for it !
[native] unemployment rate in the [ euro area remains very high ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/euro-area-unemployment-rate.png?s=umrtemu ) whereas the [ us unemployment rate is approaching acceptable levels ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/united-states-unemployment-rate.png?s=usurtot ) just some food for thought there - europeans need to realize that without some decisive action on both the monetary and fiscal front , the continent will turn japanese very quickly .
[native] ( for example , a possible greek over-reaction to turkish claims on greek islands or vice-versa ) but that was exactly what the guy i 'm talking about meant when he said > * nobody * wants germany to become a normal state . . germany would have to provide for its own security . . ( instead of being under the us nuclear umbrella )
[native] > pre-contact maori are generally not thought to have developed state-like forms : but the sharp contraction of food resources in the three or four centuries preceding european contact does seem to have produced substantial increases in stratification and political organization at the tribal level .
[native] you know and i know and everyone who 's read his comment knows that he did not mean `` every single roma ever on this planet is living in absolute abject poverty '' , and you can spin all the anecdotes and try to use `` but i 'm * technically * correct '' all you like , but it does n't make what you said any less intentionally misleading .
[non-native] however , there might be some cases in which it might be more beneficial for a student to learn based on facts .i believed that successful people are those who try new things and take risks rather than involving in things that they have alrealy know .
[non-native] even though the place i went was kyoto which is most beautiful city in japan and they have most valuable and interesting temples , nothing really remein in my mind after the trip because i was just part of the group and following a tour guide without thinking .
[native] [ ** britain may be a small island , but its ` soft power ' is unrivalled globally ** ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/letters/10294803/britain-may-be-a-small-island-but-its-soft-power-is-unrivalled-globally.html ) > britain 's `` soft power '' -- the power of attraction rather than coercion -- comes from our people , institutions and icons , as well as our government .
[non-native] if we compare the prsent no of cars in use in present with the past we can see that at present there are more cars at present as compared to the past similarly i think that in next twenty years there will be more cars in use than today there are lots of reason for that which are as follows .
[native] > what i 've never understood about americans is why criticism of capitalism is so damn taboo in your society it 's not that hard to understand , particularly considering the leaders of government and finance in the united states remember the cold war very clearly .
[native] i 've told you how to make this a conversation about the game and you keep refusing to stop being an asshole that ca n't respect opinions , so i do n't really know why you 'd think i 'd suddenly change my mind and start addressing your points .
[native] if you genuinely feel you need to get your head straight , spend a month or so taking care of yourself and getting your head in the right place before you can go back to work , then yes , you will most likely get a cert for that , provided of course you are actually depressed and showing all the normal signs of depression .
[native] i want to see an independent investigation first , just in case we 've missed something important , but if it becomes conclusive that the rebels did it ( and evidence i 've seen strongly implies it ) , then i think the uk should come with you to assist ukraine to drive them out by military means .
[non-native] for example , i heard a lot of people in western countries nowadays always share their car with their collegues or classmates , or just take the bus instead of driving a car to decrease the waste from the car which will pollute the air in the city .
[native] speed ) - $ 60 to $ 80 ( 60 gb - 300 gb ) on [ bigpond ] ( http://www.telstra.com.au/internet/home-broadband-bigpond-ultimate-plans/ ) up to 100 mb/s - $ 60 to $ 100 * * only available in the very select parts of the large cities , would be lucky to cover 5 % of the population personally , only adsl1 is available where i live ( middle of a largest city ) , so i 'm stuck on 8mb/s for $ 90/month with a 150 gb quota .
[native] i suppose the part that 's missing is the post the sjw then made telling all of her followers about [ blue ] , this awful `` antiblack '' , who is clearly so privileged they do n't even * understand * why they were called out on their post .
[non-native] another issue is that when somebody is inventing something new for example he will have the opportunity to be a legend for the whole world because simply if he succeed everybody after will follow , use or adapt his invention and he may be remembered for this for centuries even after he die and this is a great success .
[native] funnily enough , people these days complain about the democratic deficit , * and * that it should not be democratic , rather just a single market which would still have an impact on a large part of peoples lives , making it a regressive step and would just bring about problems that existed in the past .
[native] i think , looking at this from the perspective of a blue collar worker , or someone who is lowly qualified and in the service industry ( and i do not say english because these arguments apply to a lot of different countries ) , there are two strands to the pro-eu argument that i would pick up on .
[native] i think he failed in that respect though , 2001 did n't try to use science to explain everything like intersteller did , so when all of a sudden science and physics breaks down it 's far harder to suspend disbelief because you 've already been conditioned to accept a universe with rigid physical laws .
[native] also no , isreal managed to win a bunch of wars against the against some of the largest , best-equipped armies in 20th century using the best equipment that the americans made at the time . . they were not poorly equipped as you suggest , not even in the slightest .
[non-native] however , i still disagree with this statement because many people can achieve their success by avoiding risks and improving what is well-know .this statement raises a questions which can be applied to many aspects of life : sports , at , and in this case , academics .
[non-native] in nutshell , it 's not the age that makes one enjoy life - rather it 's the spirit that makes you live life to the fullest enjoying each and every moment of it .i partially agree with the statement , learning is a process that has different layers and dimensions depending on subject and personal style .
[non-native] one , reason which serves as a contradiction to the claim presented in this writing section is if everyone had a `` broad knowledge in many subjects '' there would be no one to specialize in specific subjects and this would hinder any advancments in subjects that are not studied specifically .
[native] whenever i tell my ( conservative republican ) coworker that the us has no functional left-wing party , and that our political spectrum runs from the democrats on the center right to the republicans off to the right and the tea partiers off to the far right , it drives him crazy .
[native] but it 's hard to see how they could get away with it in negotiations that involve two ( or more ) sides -- no french negotiator is going to just allow some german to shill for siemens at france 's expense , and almost certainly the american side will oppose that sort of thing and call it out .
[native] and the population added ( not including the usa , which is by far the least likely to join ) is n't all that large at approx 64 million , it would just be like another france or germany , and that 's not counting that many commonwealth citizens identify with a whole host of european countries outside the british isles .
[native] race to the bottom in water standards : if the u.s. commits water services under proposed gats rules any federal , state or local regulation governing water services , such as those designed to protect water quality , universal access , as well as public utility commission rulings , could be challenged as `` barriers to trade . '' a government would have to demonstrate that the policy was necessary and that no other less trade-restrictive measure could be taken to accomplish the same objective in order to maintain it .
[non-native] even the old saying goes `` a picture worths more than a thouthand words '' , it does n't apply on all products we see on advertisements nowadays .nowadays , there are some kind of ways to learn something which have never taken before in personal .
[non-native] in conclusion , i can say that a success is a sweet meal that needs , as ingredients , a bit of risk , a few of curiosity and a lot of know-how and a well done job .i agree with that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
[native] he 's refusing to pay because a ) he 's on minimum wage and ca n't afford it and b ) he does n't think he should * have * to pay , because it was a one-off incident and he thinks its an easy mistake to make .
[native] edit : and just so you know , people who do n't think that proper education is for elitist hipsters tend to either quietly fix their error or even thank the person who pointed that out , because they will pay more attention next time .
[native] maybe if you 're from a small country it 's a sound idea if your neighbours have similar economies and strong mutual affinities , and i can get that , but if you 're british , german or french , the gains would n't be massive compared to the losses .
[native] instead what society expected of you was to forego ( or at least keep quiet ) any activity or thing against their culture or religion and to keep to your own , and not make a fuss and above all do the job they brought you in for .
[native] every time an irish flair says anything about anything , eastern europeans jump down their throat and start yelling at them about how `` you do n't know what it 's like something something neutral something something coward '' it 's ridiculous , uncalled for in general , and insanely inaccurate and unfair .
[non-native] today , where consumers use tools such as the internet or magazines to research the qualities of a product , such as consumer reports or the j.d. power survey , exageration has lost some of it potential for persuading consumers , as long as the customer is carefull about not making impulsive desicisons to purchase a product .
[non-native] this is because understanding the ideas and concepts not only let them easier remember the facts but also let them easier make applications of the ideas and concepts , even more , it will help students develop more new ideas and concepts .i think that is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts , because once they have clear in their minds the concepst about some article , called science , mat , phycology , any thing tha they are learning , it is posible to follow up with the learning procecess .
[non-native] for example , in the present time , cars are being used on the road , but imagine the cars runing under the land , that is underground , or yet better , flying and running at the same time in the air and land .
[non-native] people knowing a broad range of academic subjects tend to look and know the superficial stuff about them , while others focusing on a certain topic , by limiting their concentration , know that particular subject in depth and so are more valuable to the development of the particular subject .in my opinoin , i think that is more than great to travel by group is so important because there are many reson to support my idea i had visit forest five years ago .
[native] it 's such a waste of money at this point when you look at the current situation in europe : three ( uk , de , fr ) of the most dominant military powers with similar political and economic ideals to the u.s. that have more than enough man-power , weaponry and defensive capabilities to protect weaker european countries .
[non-native] therefore i strongluy believe that their number will decrease /well i strongly agree with the discussion that twenty years from now there will be fewer cars in use then there are today , the very obvious reason to support my opinon on this subject is scarcity of fuel , which has already been recognized as the impending crisis human kind is going to face in this century , now cars need fuel to run , which unfortunately is a non renewable form of energy , however over the years scientist have come up various alternatives which are supposedly more efficient and non polluting than the conventionol car which uses petroleum as its fuel , however the fact remains that petroleum is still the mostly easily available fuel for running a car , atleast as of now . .
[non-native] the reasons i have presented are just three but there are many other that can confirm that a mature person can enjoy a lot the life while the young people can be just living an illusory hapiness .some people think that lessand less cars will be used in the future , while others belive that traffic is only going to get worse with time .
[native] but a lot of british people will manage to fit it into a conversation in a way you just could not see coming , and you laugh more at the ingenuity of the design of the joke than the lul french bit of the joke , although that bit is still humorous in the sense that shitty knock nock jokes are funny .
[non-native] for such people the travel in a group led by a tour guide is better but for the other people like me the individual travel is better .some people feel that it is more important for students to learn facts rather than to understad ideas and concepts .
[non-native] to me , the combination of them is the best solution .during the past ten year when the whold world has been experiencing tremendous variations in all respects , no one , more often than not , can be ignorant of such a phenomenon that whether young people or the older people are more enjoyable their life .
[non-native] so i agree that the person should cocentrate on his field first and then he should know some part of knowledges that he needs , to improve his life and to be able to comunicate with other knowledges and to learn from them what they know .
[non-native] since the aim of the advertisement is making a person buy that new product , the car will be presented as a wonderfull object , full of technologies and of services created directly in order to satisfy the consumer ; even if this description was wrong , the consumer will be influenced in any case .
[non-native] as communication technologies and psychology theories advanced considerably over the last century , the effects and power of the advertisements outfitted with high sophisticated computer generized amazing visual scenes and sound effects , grew more and more powerful in convincing the customers that `` this '' product is wonderful , inpeccable , to a extent often exceeds the reality !
[native] in many jurisdictions , there are thus special exemptions for this situation where you pathologically feel there are no alternatives left to you ; a well-established legal principle is * quod est necessarium est licitum * , and combined with * mens rea * this forms the basis of the battered legal defence for murder .
[native] but meanwhile all these straight people in the military `` yay we 're equal now we 're done here '' , never mind that transgender people still ca n't join , or the fact that the rape rate for gay men in the military is ridiculous -- and neither issue is addressed .
[non-native] it was a very surprising to see him as a nasty but in spite of all that , the movie was great and had success and so the actor is .for student , to understand ideas and concepts which represent the theory , and to learn fact which is the practice ; are both important .
[native] japan and murica , very strategic partners ( japan gets free market access & defense , murica gets important ally in east asia ) , but japan is also extremely popular ( among ppl ) in america , and america is extremely popular in japan .
[non-native] for example , if a young woman pursuing a career in acting and attending theatre classes , is struck all of a sudden by a revelation and decides her true vocation is in marine biology , she simply quits theater studies and enrolls into science school .
[native] i have no doubt that newcastle , as a club , is a good fit in terms of stature and his ability , but whether he can implement his own style on the squad , and have it be effective , is a far more difficult question .
[native] land 's at a premium in a lot of these cities , and when your office needs to expand , you ca n't always just build out , so often times it 's easy to buy a separate plot of land for an annex of the main office .
[non-native] a person who memorizes or learns only the facts about a topic can answer many questions about it correctly but when he faces with a situation where he has to modify , repair or make comments about something he would not be very successful .
[native] the same movies play at the cinema , many of the same cultural experiences will be shared growing up , and , most importantly , though there is a huge difference in legislation between us states , it does n't compare to the legislative differences between eu member states .
[non-native] people are not computers , the only way to give them a real effective culture is to make them think and understand , although we could say that cu ; lture is made by the knowledge of facts .from my point of view , i totally agree with the statement that advertisements emphasize and magnify some products in a questinnable way .
[non-native] to conclude , i would rather understand few main concepts and ideas of life that i could use in many situations than learning thousands of interesting things that i could never understand .i do not agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
[native] as for your plan to re-draw the borders of europe for this hypothetical use , why ca n't you just leave the national borders the way they are now and incorporate them the way they are but as state borders inside this hypothetical use .
[native] spying is one thing , which all allies do , but leaking stuff through various front groups , as russia has done in the past few weeks with the dnc leaks , nato general 's private emails , george soros ofs intranet documents , and the nsa cyberweapon leaks , were all done through entities/personas such as `` guccifer2 .0 , `` dcleaks '' , and `` the shadow brokers . ''
[non-native] how many times have you been moved to get the trendiest , newest , more expensive brand of clothing , cellular phone , car , etc. just to discover after a brief period of usage that , in spite of all the empty promises and alluring techniques used by the advertising company , what you got is nothing but apiece of trash ?
[native] from the sounds of the only quote in the article ( and there is , really , only one quote ) the referendum is more going to be about ratifying the new agreement they come to , or making further decisions about the future of switzerland .
[native] ukip may not be the bnp , but their electoral success is built first and foremost on dividing the world up into `` them '' and `` us '' , and ascribing greater worth to `` us '' , while ascribing `` our '' problems to `` them '' .
[native] there is no ` anti-russian ' rhetoric , there 's just a series of actions that russia has taken that naturally puts them at odds with the people of europe , and a genuine fear of the next crazy fucked up thing russia will do .
[non-native] in conclusion , i believe that each person enjoys life in his or her own way , and would like to add that will be very helpful for humanity to stop looking at situations from a personal perspective and try to understand that each person lives as he or she wants and not to compare between them .to my mind it is not correct to say that one had to take every risk to be successful .
[non-native] so if for some of them is taking longer they should not be afraid that somebody will get angry at them , but on the other hand if for somebody the subject is really easy and they get frendly with it immediately is a waste of time to get on it several times , taking the risk that they will start hating it .
[native] i could be wrong , but is it possible that the lack of increase in coal consumption actually indicates a decrease of coal as a percentage of the total energy supply , since i would assume energy consumption has gone up over that time period ?
[native] it 's pretty fucking sad that czechia is threatening to cancel a contract to build russian nuclear plants in their country , the baltics have been agitating for a greater collective response ( despite they fact that they have sizeable trade links with russia ) , and poland is taking a leading role in calling for sanctions , whilst the west has drown a red line about economic sanctions because of economic interests with frances battleship contract , the uk protecting the city , and germany refusing the change the german-russian relationship from when it was first settled under merkel , all in all , the west is being show to be unable to stick to the principles it espouses so often , while he newer eu states which are often considered to be backward from a political perspective are the only ones trying to ensure international law is respected .
[non-native] for example , without light bulbs , it 's hard for us to live especially into darkness , and they were invented by edison , so edison was a successful person , but we are just general people who use those things to be comfortable .
[native] evil right down to their cold black hearts , which pump not blood like yours and mine , but rather a thick , vomitous oil that oozes through their rotten veins and clots in their pea-sized brains which becomes the cause of their nazi-esque patterns of violent behavior .
[non-native] most of the communities are well developed , this shows us they are spending some time for the growth of their communityi agree to the fact that young generation is increasingly becoming more negligent about their community and ignoring the obligation they on the behalf of their community .
[native] it does n't help that i hate country ( which is really popular in the part of the country i live in ) , absolutely despise rap/hip hop ( popular everywhere ) , and think almost all pop music is shit straight from a dog 's ass ( again , pop music is extremely popular throughout the whole country ) .
[native] you can be the most valuable and efficient employee in the building but if you do n't look good on paper , you can forget that pay rise ... and it 's very hard to keep your kpis looking good when you 're busy doing someone else 's job .
[native] i 'm on my phone so i do n't have access to coal usage figures right now but i am really quite sure that coal usage is up massively since the nuclear shut down , and i 'll add figures when i 'm on a computer .
[native] because * some * get those kinds of jobs ( and it 's usually not because they 've helped a bill in the past , but rather because they have access to current movers and shakers ) en all politicians are corrupt , all deals are suspect , etc ?
[non-native] the other thing is young people will be having a lot of time in their life as they do n't have to earn alot as the old peole , as for the old people their will be a reponsibility to set their llife and also for young ones in a better beneficial way so their is chance that they ca n't enjoy in their life as their enjoyment may be less than the young people .
[native] but i guess you could say that this is what motivated italians to keep going with their development and not accepting a satisfactory state of being , as he never let them believe that they had truly done ` enough ' , even until the day of his * alleged * death .
[native] however there seems to be a trend that the lower the office the more prevalent the corruption in europe ( some would say in the us it 's the other way around , due to the ( lack of ) campaign financing laws ) .
[non-native] by speacilizing in one subject , you find it easier to find a job after university , and when you start working its motivating and self - fullfilling to feel that you know your major well , and this makes you like your job and appreciate it .
[non-native] i would say that it could n't get better if you are travelling with the people you like and with somebody that already have a plan for you .i think that the best way to travel is with someone who knows what they are talking about .
[non-native] for example , after completing the engineering course my friend he specialized in one subject and i had broad knowledge of all the subjects and we fortunately got job in the embedded company , it is the field that we must know all the subject knowledge in order to make a embedded product .
[non-native] this makes me being disaggre with the idea that is stated .there are plenty of cases worldwide of people becoming successful without trying new things , but focusing and putting the whole efforts over specific and alligned tasks , instead of taking the risk of developing new things .
[non-native] other major reason for young to enjoy is that young age is considered to be the `` age of moulding '' , thus he tries to learn more and more of the things which in itself is an interesting affair because gaining anything new is always fun , even though at times it might be leading to the wrong side of the track , but here we are discussing about enjoying life , so anyone in this young age could easily deviate to a path which might be misleading but still enjoying while on the other hand , an old individual is prone to be afraid of going for something new as he has a lot of responsibilities on him and would have to think about it a hundred times before going for it , so he usually sticks to the orthodox schedule which make make him further more reluctant for going for fun filled part .
[non-native] communities can only exists if there is a shared interst , but now a days there are so many choices and as young minds changes every now and then we think that they are not helping the community in which they had taken part .a traditional way to travel is travel in a group and follow a tour guide , now days , more and more people would prefer travel by themselves , because they can explor more and disscover more by themselves .
[non-native] in addition to successful sport players , successful businessmen or women are apt to try new things and take risks , but sometimes , they think that taking risks and trying new things have dangerous , but we can make a lot of money and fame .
[non-native] to sum up , with the widely spreading concept of maintaining good health , the utility of advanced mass transportation and the help of the govenment , there will be fewer cars in 20 years use than there are today .as people get older , they realize what was obvious from the beginning : that they will die .
[non-native] the successful people are well aware about their things eg ; in case of a doctor particularly cardilogist , he may diagnose the problems of heart and treat it only the diagnosed diseases but if he try to success in new things like heart surgeries that may increase the life of a man .
[non-native] another example is when we tour in school days we miss the way with teachers and we went to another place we had struck there for one day we had enjoy there by missing as we go to different place but fianlly we made our way that our teacher were , this is one which i will not going to forget .
[native] well , yeah , y' kinda do under the unclos > every state shall require the master of a ship flying its flag , in so far as he can do so without serious danger to the ship , the crew or the passengers : > ( a ) to render assistance to any person found at sea in danger of being lost ; > ( b ) to proceed with all possible speed to the rescue of persons in distress , if informed of their need of assistance , in so far as such action may reasonably be expected of him ; > ( c ) after a collision , to render assistance to the other ship , its crew and its passengers and , where possible , to inform the other ship of the name of his own ship , its port of registry and the nearest port at which it will call .
[non-native] assuming that life goes on as it is now and no such abnormal activity happens , i see no reason why the number of cars being used will come down .i disagree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
[non-native] for example take cricket , tennis , where people who have maintained their fitness all throughout their life have managed to play even in the later part of their live 's and also won many titles and awards , such as s.graff who played her last match at age of 40 plus and yet won the title .
[non-native] as a result , i think that the decreasing of cars will be just around the corner .i agree with the idea that it is essential for successful people to challenge new things and difficulties rather than only doing what they repeat same things which they know how to do .
[non-native] indeed , tour guide makes travelling esiar , safer and more enjoyable , want my advice ? , never go on atrip without a tour guide .some people hold a openion is advertisements make products better than they are superior to advertisement make products not really better in many ways .
[non-native] thus as older cars slowly fall into disuse the number of cars totally in use will go down in the next twenty years .although some people said that successful people are creative and more challegeble than others , i disagree with this view point .
[non-native] in the accademic contest is also better have a broad konowledge due in the accademy you have someone who explain you the things so you colud understend things that only reading one book never explain , is also true that there are certein argoments for what every people is not predisposed , in that cases , well , i thing is better avoid these subjects , yes is not the best solution but i hate break my head over a thing that i never understend , and i prefer dedicate that time to other acticities hows give me a soddisfaction .
[native] well [ according to this table ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federal_taxation_and_spending_by_state#tables_of_federal_taxation_and_spending_by_state ) kansas , arkansas , illinois , ohio , new jersey , nebraska , minnesota , and delaware all give net contributions of 8 % of their gdp or more - all the way up to 22 % in delaware 's case .
[non-native] in conclusin , the people are still traveling with or without toure guide , but in my opinion i prefer to travel without led by tour guide .in twenty years from know on is not too much time but i am sure there will be a hugh transformation , we migth not have in account all the avances has been done in just a few yaers , but this is because is gradually .
[native] i do n't condone the pkk 's actions which specifically targeted civilian - though i think it should be noted that attacks on tourists have been almost all carried out by tak and condemned by the pkk , though this is not civilians as a whole and this is wrong - but their designation as a terror organization is a joke when they are a popularly supported group with very specific political aims , in which they would stop fighting when their aims are met .
[native] but note you are not only claiming that they want to be independent but also that they want the dalai lama to be `` back '' in one form or another , a figure who if had any influence in ruling an independent tibet would organize it heavily in the interests of the american government who have grand standed him for so long .
[non-native] we have number of manufactures like ferrari , lamborgini , maybach , mercedes , hyundai , fiat , opel etc. are competing everyday in the automobile industry to manufacture or to produce a new car with all the amenities or luxuries along with the performance .
[non-native] personally , i have had several experiences where i have toured together with an american flutist , an austrian clarnettist , a greek violinist etc. , which are left indispensable impressions on me first of all with the conviviality of sharing and using different ideas that we all possess .
[non-native] when we get there the reality is so far away we realize that the hotel is not in the location shown or at least does not have the features presented , we understand the picture did not show how many ads and signal everywhere it was possible to see , making our enjoyable destination as polluted as a capital city and making our frustation the most unforgettable of our vacations .
[non-native] while , in other side to be specialize in one and specific subject no doubt you will be able to do and work and study and do what ever you want because from the beginig you knew what you want and need to do and sure you will be specialiser in it and everyone around you will certanly trust you because as i mentioned before that you are already knowing what you want , love and need to do and if you asked me that question another million time i will choose the second statement everytime you asked me .usually , long ago people do not use the car as people use it now .
[non-native] in conclution i desagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do , every person should deside when to enjoy life , that shoud be every person 's goal in life , to have the posibility to chouse what fits their personal nesecities .as far as different concepts for education in school are concerned it 's still a great issue if learning facts or understanding ideas should have the main priority .
[non-native] it is important to have correct views of them .i believe that the young people in nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities because that the young people in nowadays does not care about other people around them and only cares about themselves .
[native] some notable overseas countries where german is spoken include ( note that all of these numbers refer to native speakers ) : • ** argentina ** : 600,000 speakers ( 400,000 standard german and 200,000 yiddish ) • ** bolivia ** : 220,000 speakers ( 160,000 standard german and 60,000 low german ) • ** brazil ** : 4.5 million speakers ( 1.5 million speak standard german and 3 million speak riograndenser hunsrückisch , a unique brazilian german dialect ) • ** canada ** : 548,200 speakers ( 430,000 standard german ; 80,000 low german ; 15,000 pennsylvania dutch ; 23,200 hutterite german ) .
[non-native] and also the advertisments its grow with time gust think about it , it start with waht and look now , you know in the past the ad was transmitted between peple by talking and some of them well not get bequse if they ware a far away after that it cames better if there is an ad the well write it on wall or in places ware the pepol can see after that it came better the radio came after that the tv came then the faster thing untill now cam the computor and just see waht we are .in my point of view understanding ideas and concepts is very important .
[native] from a purely egalitarian point of view , our primary focus should be spending our collective resources on combating poverty and other social inequalities , for no reason other than that people 's experiences as self-aware animals are the most important thing , and inequalities in people 's experiences should take top priority .
[native] because , you dishonest rat , [ the uk also has to agree to the outcome of negotiations , because the results of the negotiations are under the shared competences of the eu and it 's member states ] ( http://fdcl-berlin.de/fileadmin/fdcl/fta_peru_col/fta_eu_peru_and_colombia_mixed_agreement_en.pdf ) , leading to ` mixed agreements ' , as per article 4 of the treaty on the functioning of the eu .
[native] its this sort of bullshit technocratic elitism that made me begin to give up on this entire retarded site , i 'll leave with this so you can continue inflating each others total confidence with your highfive points that the whole world just needs a few technicians to sort all this messy drama out .
[non-native] thirdly a group could be managed effectively by a tour guide as one person would want to go to right other to left few of them wanna sit and relax , a tour guide would comprehend all the requirements of the group and could suggest effectively what needs to be done and he is the one who could be reliable for every piece of information .
[non-native] for example , when a theory of pendulum is taught in a class the students do try to learn the principle of it but are least interested ( atleast galileo ) in how it happened to be seen light , and again it is a different story .
[native] well , while the beta map was a massive sniperfest , i did n't actually hate it even though i never play sniper class in bf-style games ( or more precisely - i never use a sniper rifle as i consider it an easy mode ) .
[native] `` ukraine is n't even a real country , crimea has always been russian , we deserve that land '' > that obviously should n't mean that it has not been a misery for the native people that have been displaced , but speaking in terms of `` annexation '' and `` occupation '' simply makes no sense .
[native] if you want women to get into those jobs , we need to change as a society to start ignoring gender differences at early ages ( for example , not teaching that girls should like dolls and guys should like trucks ) and allowing people to have the freedom to pursue whatever choices they want in life without having undue pressure put on them based on their gender .
[non-native] for example let us think about a manager who knows all the kinds of problems which could happen in an enterprise but who who has n't a graet preparation in order to solve them because during his academic career he did n't specialized in one particular subject .
[non-native] when we are reading a newspaper and if we just read about ideas , we can not see what is important effects or the facts what the article want to teach us or what is the reasons that this matter have to be in the newpaper .
[non-native] whereas the first helps in the private sector of an individual ( for example when it comes to his social status or social prestige ) , the latter is necessary in the public sector , namely the field in which the individual is working .
[non-native] finally ; this way of learnig is only for the students who have the abundant resources of teachers who can argue with them and for the student who does not study only for the exam and who wants to learn for life .i do not agree the opinion of the statement .
[native] > very poor record of western powers coming to their help , yeah i 'm sorry but the entire empire/commonwealth came to help when it came to poland so that is n't true , unless you expected after literally millions of casaulties and being financially ruined for us to declare war on the soveit union with the soviet union having 3 * our army ( us as well is included ) in the front line ( east germany ) .
[non-native] from what i have experienced and seen i personly think that young people are making a great effort to help their communities and are also benefitting from it .today are many the possibilities to do something to help the community and the society in wich we live .
[non-native] for example , when i went to brasil with my class , i had to do all the things that the tour guide tell us to do , so we ca n't decide wich restorant pick for lunch , or with pub to go on nigths .
[native] but to my mind , this is kind of a wake up call , that there is a real need for defense budgets in the relative stratosphere , for an american population that is proud and patriotic and holds liberal values that is willing to spend so much and take action when no one else will .
[native] real refugees will be happy and have a safe place to live while economic migrants ( seems the bulk of those coming ) will stop bothering to try and get to europe when they see all they will get is sent to a camp somewhere .
[native] it would n't stop the conflict going on in eastern ukraine right now , because no sane human being would use a nuclear bomb in such a situation , and no sane human being would force a nuclear power into a position in which it has no choice but to use the nuclear bomb .
[native] i once had a person die in the ambulance , sometimes the patient died on the chopper , sometimes they died in ed , sometimes in intensive care , sometimes they died in the hdu , the amount of old guys dying in the cardiac care department was crazy , there was palliative care which always had terminal cancer victims dying .
[native] a quick example is last year at ryerson a male student who because of certain religious beliefs refused to work with women ; i would not let that person into my mixed-gender lab group because it would destroy productive relationships and undermine group cohesion .
[native] there 's very little ability to gain data from donbass at the moment , but : - they 've had elections ( which everyone fighting against them will call a farce ) ( anecdotally , acquaintainces from donbass claim that there was extremely high voter turnout , so the process was at least somewhat fair ) - their demographics from before the war started indicate a russian minority , which ~ ~ is a majority in the cities and a majority in the territory currently controlled ~ ~ a minority when counting territory controlled by donbass , though a large one ( 45 % ) .
[non-native] however , as the comprehensive stuy discussed above , i can safely draw the conclusion that young people do not enjoyb life more than older people do .regarding the statement , successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well , i agree with this idea .
[native] i 've had all sorts of chocolates , from all over the globe , including super high quality hand made chocolates from locally grown specialty varieties of cacao , so i think i know good chocolate , but i still think hershey 's is not bad .
[non-native] i think that another problem for what they can not help their comunities is not the ammount of time they have , but their education since they were born and the lack of sense and sensiblility they have , not only for helping their comunities but also for helping other people .
[native] i believe there will be a global economic crisis taking place within the next 5-10 that will trigger a massive expansion of the liberty movement worldwide , ultimately fuelled by the realisation that these centralised systems of social control we 're all using ( even in america ) are what 's causing so many the social and economic ills of western civilization .
[native] [ ** french military heads threaten to resign over ` grave ' defence cuts ** ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/10852165/french-military-heads-threaten-to-resign-over-grave-defence-cuts.html ) > french army , navy and air force chiefs and its joint chief-of-staff threaten to resign over military spending cuts , with jean-yves le drian , defence minister , warning they would render foreign operations impossible > -------------------------------------------------------------------------- > france 's top four military chiefs have threatened to resign if the government makes more cuts to their budget , with the defence minister warning a further drop in spending would leave it * `` unable to conduct new operations '' * abroad .
[native] plus i do not care if they are made by newborns , they are fucking delicious chocolate , one of the only chocolate i really enjoy , and after major holidays the grocery stores sell the jumbo bars they bought for next to nothing .
[native] it does n't mean they think they 're going to win the case ( or even hope to ) , rather they want to stop other countries from implementing plain packaging and feel the cost of the lawyers will be substantially less than what they 'll make from the countries that delayed implementation of plain packaging laws .
[non-native] for example i want to success in my career i am a lawyer and i wanto to be a well know lawyer in my country in that circunstances i know that i have to work very hard to do it , no trying new things just doing what i really know and doing well the tings that i really know in this way i sure that i wiil success .
[non-native] travelling is a form of freedom in my eyes , and i believe the best result and the knowlege of a place is when one makes an adventourous effort to explore it .today , in the bachelor degree of the university , many people take the double majors and try to pursue the various aspects of academic subjects .
[non-native] this future aspect will force governments to rasie the prices of fuel , simply from the decline in the amounts of such substance in its origin places , as such event is occuring from the excess supplying and the carelessness for the accuarte foundation of such materail .
[native] not only was the `` bill '' $ 0.00 but she was signed up for free medical care for the first 6 years of her life , free monthly checkups for the first two years and with each visit for the first year free supplies ( baby formulas etc ) .
[non-native] so old people can not enjoy the life as much as the young people because they have financial problems , they may be suffering from chronic diseases moreover they dont have so much energy to enjoy thier life when compared to the energetic young people .nowadays the sciense is advancing very quickly because of the progress of many academic subjects , each day we know more and more about our world , about us ( human ) , the scienses is growing so fast , many people thinks that its better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects and other that its better to specialize in one specific subject , i think that its better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , my point of view is support for the following reasons :
[non-native] i believe somebody 's idea which seemed to be odd or crazy at the moment can make people 's successful story let alone their success will help other 's life more efficiently .in my opion , i agree that young people exactly enjot life more than older people do .
[native] nope , if governments all decided to veer in the other direction we could definitely mitigate the oncoming catastrophe - of course some of the damage is already done but there are several things we could do which would sequester most of the carbon we emit and then some .
[native] but then the czech `` nuclear hag '' ( that 's what she called herself ) , a popular director of the above-mentioned authority , said that these were just pre-pre-selection surveys to find out whether it 's worth even starting the process of selecting those places , which calmed most of the shouting voices down .
[native] i think with news being so frequently shared on social media and the demand for page views being so high , we 've entered into a new era of `` yellow journalism '' where journalists can screencap a handful of social media comments and proclaim it 's representative of public opinion .
[non-native] if being in a group is not the best way for you to fulfil your aim , then that might mean that travelling alone is better for you to fully enjoy your trip .in the college , every students listen some classes provided by professor .
[native] [ telegraph ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/11086631/lord-hill-wins-financial-services-post-in-new-european-commission.html ) : > `` i think that is a great piece of news because 40 per cent of europe 's financial services industry is in the united kingdom , a lot of it here in scotland , '' said mr cameron while campaigning in edinburgh against scottish independence .
[non-native] let us say that even though learning facts is sometimes very important , there is always the need to be able to use them , and to understand a specific situation .in this society , understanding ideas and concepts and learning facts are both important to the students .
[native] i can appreciate why people are reluctant to write a blank cheque to greece to turn the ship around ( in fact i understand the political pressures in doing so ) , but further cuts in government spending and fire-sale privatisations are not the answer for greece .
[native] good news is , the web version of duolingo on ipad is probably a lot better than the app , because it will come with all the notes about grammar and stuff - and it 's faster on an ipad than an iphone ( although not as fast as a computer , of course ) .
[non-native] .in my opinion the enjoymanet of young people are more than thats for older people , because young people dont have a lot of ressponsibilities during the youth period such as that upon older people which include home loans , taxes , bills . ..
[non-native] i think that taking risks is the only manner to heve a possibility of success , because behind a risk , there is always a good prospective and a wonderful occasion .it is importent for astudent to understand ideas and concept , because it is more needed for his future , iam agreeing with the statement following reasons more helpful to my selection .
[native] you have no idea how old i am , how long i 've been studying for , and what kind of life or work experience i 've had in the past , so how about you keep those ridiculous and petty remarks to yourself , sunshine .
[non-native] in fact , i think that there may be more cars than now , because the world is growing so fast and most people preffer cars than any other way of transport .the traditional cars , which are being used today use petroleum , which is a non renewable source of energy for their functioning .
[non-native] even though mistakes are always possible , if one has a good method of working , clear ideas and concepts in its mind , he/she could discover soon the errors .i agree with the statement bacause , according to me , the new technologies will allow people to improve the quality of public transport .
[native] btw the other bot i mentioned works on a per-user basis and a single user being scanned takes a huge amount of time , the only time i 've ever actually used it was in an / r/nz daily thread sometime last year to show people , and a few times since then to tell whether someone 's a troll .
[non-native] taking as a reference the business world , every year we see how globalization grows in the countries and how barriers disappear , creating the necessity of better prepared persons that understand the interactions between several fields of study , as well as the problems that are derived from these interactions .
[native] but suffice it to say , i just think there 's way too much diversity in the human race to boil it down to simple arguments like that , whereas corporate culture is much smaller and much tighter knit with less diversity that better explains it .
[native] but to use `` zionist '' as a descriptor is crazy , it 's nothing to do with zionism , it 's just big business spending big money to secure their interests while us voters thrash around trying to con our politicians into doing something in our common interests for once .
[non-native] in conclusion , i believe that join a travel group led by a tour guide is a better way than travel alone because it easy , cost saving , and more fun .from my point of view , i would say traveling alone is the best way can go and have fun an dnot worry about anything else .
[non-native] but i think you should not risk anything at all if your family is involved , because your children might suffer from it .i think the products we see on tv ads , newspapers , magazines and billboards are usually exegerrated , but this is the point of an advertisment , to make us believe that we really need that product or that product will solve all of our problems about whatever that product is for .
[non-native] in such a case if one have broad knowledge about many academic subject i mean if he or she have enough knowlegde to make that job , the job is going to be offered for him or her , in addition to that the people have broad knowledge can have a chance to be promoted .
[non-native] a different important aspect that support the concept and idea focus is the traing of phantasy that is realy helpful to find new solutions and to extent the capability of a person to deal with problems that have not standard ways to be solved .
[native] i can assure you , the eu would not ` happily let them take it ' , that would defeat the purpose of their whole exercise in the ukraine and flies in the face of * everything * they have said and done up to this point .
[non-native] i certainly think this is not the case , but i would let any given younger person to judge , and in the end , i do not seriously care - which could also mean that i have already arrived at this distant maturity . ..
[native] the conflict has exposed just how weak the eu is as an institution , with russia picking it apart by playing the individual countries against each other , be it gas , economic deals/sanctions , and supporting euroskeptic/right-wing political parties ( fidesz/jobbik , arguably fn and berlusconi ) .
[native] it has sd 820 instead of 808 , it can get android 7 ( and i doubt priv is going to get it , which is quite a disappointment ) , it 's lighter , that fingerprint sensor is pretty snappy , usb-c is great ...
[non-native] maybe a group of friends on a trip can be the better way to travel to a new land for me and even if a tour guide is leadding us because im not really looking to get lost in a city i dont even know , at least not for now or any soon .concerning the fact to imply oneself in community life , young people probably feel a lack of trust in the authorities and do n't want to participate any ; ore to the social life .
[native] > personally i think offending us companies should be liable for destructive fines for their complicity in circumventing eu law , large enough in magnitude that they are either forced to comply , forced to no longer continue business in europe , or to fold .
[non-native] we each should try new things and prepare for some risks in order to grow ourselves as a person .as a matter of fact , the issue of whether successful people try new things and take risker rather than only doing what they already know how to do well is a complex ahd controversial topic .
[non-native] why i agree with the statement is because , when i watch tv , i can see a lot of advertisement for good things , and when i see things from advertisements at store , it does no look quiet same as that of advertisement .
[non-native] so the new rich and middle class people of china and india will try to achieve this certain level of comfort and status by buying huge amounts of cars , meanwhile the demand for cars in relatively wealthy and developed regions like europe or northern america will stagnate at it 's current level .
[non-native] so , it is easy to see that claiming bad effects cars have , such as polluting air , even though these effects are important enough to carefully think about , wo n't be able to stop us using cars in twenty years as we are n't now .
[non-native] not because they did not want the upliftment of the community , that was socially biased by are ansestors , but for the the fact that they just wanted these seats to be given to the more deserving student who may be in a very economically challenged & brilliant student .
[non-native] friends are the salt in the soup , and while older people do n't tend to have more friends than the younger generation ( true , i do n't have any hard evidence to support this , but it has been my general observation in my immediate environment ) , they usually tend to have closer friends that they have known for decades .
[non-native] the main point is the following one , you attend school to shape your mind and in order to shape your mind you read and hear about concepts that very important researchers worked on and the main purpose is to understand how they worked to build their theories .
[native] so first the western european banks create instruments made to fail , sell them to the greeks , and surprise when another of their crony banks triggers the gfc , the instruments blow up in their faces before they have time to insulate themselves from them .
[native] from a hygienic point of view , i do n't want a pool of love juices on my coffee table ... other than that , no worries , as long they accept all responsibility for their actions ( including broken coffee table or compromising photos on fb )
[native] as to ukraine , i really think you need to do some more research on that because you 've swallowed the ( incorrect ) ukip stance hook , line , and sinker , despite being if not outright wrong , then wrong in the interpretation of important events .
[non-native] surely the work has already been started , because the affect of this fear is already noticable in the current scenario .i think , that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than to specialize in one specific subject , because nowadays is very important understand and know a little bit of everything .
[native] russia probably was hoping the separatists would 've been able to create a stalemate by using sophisticated russian arms ( and maybe troops ) , but they did n't anticipate things like mh17 and the severity of the sanctions , so they had to reduce their level of support to the insurgents .
[native] i state that two nations working together to a common goal ( and who signed a pact ) are allies ( that 's lower-case allies , not upper-case allies ) , so * obviously * i 'm trying to make the western allies ( who are n't fucking involved in this story ) look like perfect golden knights .
[non-native] since people are familiar with the car manipulation and infrastructures are for completed for cars , people will not replace cars to another transportation by these two reasons i believe that car use will be increase in twenty years .i definitely agree with the statement exposed before , since my experience showed me that understanding ideas is more important that just learning facts .
[non-native] i think that sadly a lot of people front the risk in a way like this , for example choosing to invest their money in financial actions , whithout having any information about them , or because adviced by banks of other institutes , which give to client informations that he does n't understand at all .
[non-native] for example , many people who travels did not in a group have the experiences that they may waste plenty of time in seeking for the traveling place and buses to the places , or they will be suggested to buy many expensive and useless things in the travel places .
[native] i just ca n't figure out what the point of the conventional forces over there is , it 's pretty clear that a confrontation between nato and russia will involve nuclear force , even if its localised to those regions , having ground forces there wo n't make any strategic difference when the bombs start flying , it 'll just make diplomatic negotiations more difficult .
[native] * adria was a douchebag for immediately going public , taking it personally , not talking privately to hank beforehand like a reasonable person -- if she was gon na complain she should have just requested he be given a talking to , nothing worse .
[native] for some additional info , to get a rough idea of their political allegiances in the european elections ; citizens for european development of bulgaria ( gerb ) : epp bulgarian socialist party : s&d movement for rights and freedoms : alde reformist bloc : epp bulgaria without censorship : ecr patriotic front : formed electoral alliance with bulgaria without censorship , so ecr alternative for bulgarian revival : new party , has never won seats , so non-inscrit attack : non-inscrit
[non-native] it is not that i am not hopeful , i am , and i really hope that i am wrong in not believing in humans , it is just that i look out into our lives and i see what is there , not what i wish to see .after baby is born he/she growes up in many developmental stages .
[non-native] what is your thinking , your concepts or your ideas , like math have many of way to solve problem not just one .i agree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
[native] i think it 's clear that although on the one hand the english landlords were concerned about loosing profits from food exports , on the other hand they clearly had a very racist opinion of the irish and believed that they deserved to suffer .
[native] sinn féin , due to being around so long but having been out of southern government for the best part of a century , is starting to see a surge in popularity as a legitimate alternative , especially due to the peace process and what appears to be a stable northern ireland giving them legitimacy as a political party in its own right as opposed to simply being the political wing of the ira .
[native] the french ban on face covering is an act of parliament passed by the senate of france on 14 september 2010 , resulting in the ban on the wearing of face-covering headgear , including masks , helmets , balaclava , niqābs and other veils covering the face in public places , except under specified circumstances .
[native] i was in hungary recently and i could n't help but notice that , for a country that joined the eu the same time as poland , i 'd say that poland is about twice as prosperous ... at least in terms of average incomes in each respective capitals .
[native] for instance , i 've only been doing the absolute minimum with my french for the past year ( i 've only been learning it for a year ) because i 've had a lot of education work and german work , but i can still kind of muddle through a basic conversation , ask for directions , order food and so on .
[non-native] when i was in highschool i hated learning facts because it was extremely boring , i thought that what mattered the most was understanding what the teachers were talking about , that 's why i was always paying attention in class but since i hated facts i was n't studying much at home .
[non-native] all we should notice that when people are traveling or exploring new places , having a tour guide and a group of people are positive influeces for their trip .i disagree with the statement and i believe that people should specialize in one specific area of study .
[native] look how fast syria went from a relatively peaceful country to a war torn jihadist heaven , but also look at how fast places like bosnia have recovered from civil wars that were just as bad as what 's going on in the middle east , if not worse .
[native] by your logic , the government can do anything unconstitutional , which i believe the mass surveillance network is , and just stamp it as top-secret and therefore no one in the public can ever know about it without the whole government apparatus moving to crush the journalists who released it .
[native] sept. 2014 : * u-1 persons unemployed 15 weeks or longer , as a percent of the civilian labor force - 2.8 % * u-2 job losers and persons who completed temporary jobs , as a percent of the civilian labor force - 2.9 % * u-3 total unemployed , as a percent of the civilian labor force ( official unemployment rate ) - 5.9 % * u-4 total unemployed ** plus discouraged workers ** , as a percent of the civilian labor force plus discouraged workers - 6.4 % * u-5 total unemployed , plus discouraged workers , ** plus all other persons marginally attached to the labor force ** , as a percent of the civilian labor force plus all persons marginally attached to the labor force - 7.3 % * u-6 total unemployed , plus all persons marginally attached to the labor force , ** plus total employed part time for economic reasons ** , as a percent of the civilian labor force plus all persons marginally attached to the labor force - 11.8 %
[non-native] a baby is usued to enjoy everything because everything is new ; a very old person may feels like he has no more reason to live , and so his life becomes something like `` waiting for godot '' , waiting for something trying to find some distraction to spend life .
[native] i rode quite a bit of 10 this summer , the only bit that was signed was the bit on the lithuanian coast , they 're a little bit useless without a more detailed map of them ( which does n't yet exist ) .
[native] again , my qualm with the policy is not that it does n't `` work '' ( debatable considering the cost etc ) but i suppose it comes down to whether or not you think breaking the un convention on human rights is okay because it `` works '' .
[native] i came across this quote by thomas paine yesterday and i 'm pleased to get a chance to use it now : > `` to argue with a man who has renounced the use and authority of reason , and whose philosophy consists in holding humanity in contempt , is like administering medicine to the dead , or endeavoring to convert an atheist by scripture . '' i do hope you 'll regain the use of your reason someday .
[native] the epicanthal fold for example is seen very predominantly in southeast asian , east asian , central asian , and south asian populations or those with at least partial genetic heritage from those regions ( i 'm `` white '' but have it ) .
[native] even if all non-citizens were deported , incentives were offered so dual citizens could leave , and all further migration to europe were immediately halted , there will still be millions of citizens in france , belgium and other european countries that are n't integrated and they will pose problems for the foreseeable future .
[non-native] moreover , it is important to people to have more konwealge about this fact , because thai fully agree with the statement , because it 's just what i 've always done in my life , every time i had to learn a new thing .
[non-native] if you combine the them you increase drastically the possibility of finding a solution to problems concerning a topic because you understood the concepts and ideas that are behind it and you can compare a possible solution with the solutions that somebody else took for a similar problem .
[native] i was n't saying that because a high proportion of jews are israeli it 's ok to bash jews or mistreat them ; rather i was pointing out that when jews talk about being run out of other countries and feeling like they have nowhere to go they do kinda have a point .
[native] > i do n't hate britain at all , just find your arrogance when it comes to europe grating posting rubbish like that on a thread who 's topic has been done to death on here is probably why you are n't getting many quality replies .
[native] i promise you that an image with 1000 dpi recorded into it and one with 10 dpi recorded , can be an ** identical image with an identical number of pixels ** , except with a different meta-tag telling the printer that the 1000 dpi image should be the size of a piece of a4 , and the 10 dpi one should fit on a 4x6 metre billboard -- even though both images have the same number of pixels , the 4x6 printout will just look shitty if you 're standing close up and totally fine from a distance .
[non-native] like when newton sat under the tree he saw a apple falling down then he started thinking about this this made him to know about the gravitational force he did not leave this to the fact that if a object is thrown then for conform it comes bak on to the earth he just started thikinfg about this and he got sudcceded in kowing about this .
[non-native] or maybe if the prince of wales says he uses dunlop deodorant and he feels satisfied with it , then we will assume the product does n't harm the enviroment .to be a broad-knowledge person or to be a specialized person depends on a case-by-case analysis .
[native] and dying in your beds many years from now , would be willing to trade all the days from this day to that for one chance , just one chance to come back to the polling booth and tell our enemies that they may take our yes votes , but they 'll never take our freedom !!
[non-native] in conclusion , i would like to say that it is better to have one particullar specific knowledge of someting than have little knowledge of many academic subject .i agree that it is more important for students to understnad ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
[native] this to me is the benefit of liberalized trade , and my view is obviously a bit simplistic , flawed , and perhaps even callous - we do n't * need * to ensure minimum wage and conditions for factories when we liberalize trade - specifically because we should be taking advantage of the above specialization .
[non-native] these ads want us to desire to be like the people we see on these ads and then they convince us that we can be exactly like them if we buy their product , as if that product magically transform us into the person we want to be .
[non-native] finally i think that this is the world were we live , we will find a variety and several persons with different opinions and concerns about life , studies , and whatever is in our minds , but in this speciffic answer now you know my opinion , for me it is easier to lern ideas and concepts , maybe for you is the same , or maybe not .
[non-native] also in place of his work , he might someday make use of his knowledge in other academic fields than what he is currently practicing , helping him handle a critical situation better and attain more success at work and a thus a brighter future ahead .
[native] and this is furthered in other areas which have less to do with canada 's social liberalism , such as foreign military interventions ( notably refusing to participate in iraq in 2003 , similar to most europeans excluding the uk ) and foreign policy ( canada having full relations with cuba , despite strong american resistance ) .
[native] * the campaign as a whole destroyed the native irish catholic land-owning classes , who were replaced by english protestants who took over the land , leading to a surge of resentment and providing the impetus for the rise of irish nationalism in the 17th century onwards .
[non-native] last year i joined a group of 23 international volunteers in kenya and the aim of the project was to build a road ( or may i should say a way ) in the middle of a forest to make children able to go to school .
[native] the people i tend to hang out with tend to be more highly educated and i do n't usually go to the sort of pub with 18-22 yearolds who get drunk and fighty so i 'm not exposed to opportunities to experience dickheads so much .
[native] > ** the pak fa ( russian : пак фа , russian : перспективный авиационный комплекс фронтовой авиации , perspektivny aviatsionny kompleks frontovoy aviatsii , literally `` prospective airborne complex of frontline aviation '' ) is a fifth-generation fighter programme of the russian air force .
[non-native] even if these efforts are worthly of support i personally think that the consumers are the final judges and they will determine the success or the failure of a product also according to the gap between how it 's presented and how it really is .
[non-native] in these eastern countries , as , for example , china and india , there is a big population that is in costant increasing of their birth , but , what is more important , is growing the level of their social and technological culture and knowledge .
[non-native] as a conclusion , i would say the relevance of the statement depends on the definition one can give to the words and the way you understand it .during our last few school years , we are faced with choosing subjects which we would like to specialise in , in the future .
[native] our roads are imperial-only by law except widths/heights which must be in feet and inches but are allowed to have an equivalent in metres as well , some of our legislation is imperial ( three inches is the longest knife you can have on you in public without a good reason ) and you can only buy beer by the pint in a pub .
[non-native] however , if people are able to see this problem historically , economically and environmentally , people are able to come up with the idea to carry out the significant treatment , it encourages many indians to get food supply and service and more number of people are able to survive as long as possible .
[native] if someone breaks into your apartment and claims they 're going to shoot you and you defend yourself accordingly , even if they lied and do n't end up having a gun on them , you are protected by self defence law ; that 's reasonable and how it works in common-law countries .
[native] if you visit / r/nzcss where myself and some others are designing the new look for / r/newzealand , you will find a list of useful links on the side bar under `` visiting new zealand '' then under the '' + as a tourist '' heading .
[native] true , but small developed countries seem to have a common characteristic : the ratio of exports : gdp is very high ( luxembourg is 210 % , malta 93 % , estonia 83 % , bahrain 73 % , slovenia 76 % ) .
[non-native] so i gree with the authors claim is that successful people try new things and take risk and become more successful .i have traveled in many countries with my friends , and my answer for this statement is that it is depend on where we travel , and what purpose we travel .
[native] while both are horrible things and totally immoral , the conditions that brought them about , and the intent when sentencing people to these two styles of camps , were different and they should be viewed with a different approach , not with the view that they are simply the same thing in two different places .
[native] racism in romania , spanish police vs protestors , beardless jesus engraving found in spain , protests over a law in estonia , a bridge in germany , a german graffiti artist who died , ukrainian politician dragged around in a bin , latvia 's election .
[native] however , part of the irish problem was that their economy is closely coupled to the uk economy ( meaning that their interest rates should have been similar to uk interest rates rather than german interest rates , which meant that their boom was bigger than it should have been ) and also that they have a massive banking sector ( which when it crashes , crashes badly ) .
[non-native] after about twenty years , when these two kinds of energy can be used in cars , people would like to make a use of these cars under the thought to protect environment , and this thought , will be erected in ten years ascribed to the education that pay attention to the education in this area .
[native] itt : people who do n't understand statistics , demographic change , birth-death rate relations , or know anything about the economic development of africa coupled with a sprinkling of the eurocentrism as the pinnacle of human civilization that allowed the nazis to do what they did .
[native] > where the russia ( ussr ) border has been pushed back and where russias border needs to be in order to have any chance at being a super power is pretty much west of the baltics because otherwise it wo n't be able to defend itself if russia finally decides to go fishing and start a war with nato .
[native] russia can continue to reply with it 's own sanctions or threats of other actions , but the only real power it wields in europe is a ) an enormous military , which it will not utilize against an eu or nato member-state , and b ) it 's supply of energy , which it can not wield in great effect because of the overreliance of the russian economy upon the energy market .
[non-native] to answer this queistion is importnat to take two points of view , the first one is to answer why young people enjoy life , and then answer why old people enjoy life , and finally i will see who enjoy more life , young or older people .
[native] if nato were to go to war with russia it would n't be because the major nato nations care so much for estonia ( again , sorry estonians ) , it would be because to not react would be an invitation for a whole lot of instability in the world .
[non-native] in addition , to have a broad knowlegde of many academic subjects is better than to specialize in one specific subject i think because it helps you in many situations as like in your job or personal situations .i disagree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
[native] it would be interesting if the mep candidates for the various national parties actually campaigned under their eu party name ( eg epp ) , and with their eu party manifesto , rather than the confusion that results from people voting for their national parties as proxys .
[non-native] facts and ideas are the cousins in aspects , but coming to the point i strongly disagree that it is more important for the students to undersatnd ideas and concepts that it is for them to learn facts in following situation such as in their school life , professional life and in personal life .
[non-native] in addition the new method of preserventing air pollution will be developed so people do not need to worry about the use of cars in the future .i agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide for the following reasons .
[non-native] of course she still takes care of herself and has her own way to entertain herself however it will not be the same as when she was still in highschool , she might want to become gardener or travel all around the world , but her needs are more cultural and family-like than those of young people
[native] > your defence of their actions is as disgusting as the actions themselves and this is your same defense as last time you got called out for being racist - `` how dare you accuse me of being racist it 's not racist if it 's true it 's just realism fuck how can you defend these pieces of garbage to endorse rape and murder you 're disgusting '' > and it 's the fact that they can rely on someone like you appearing in every discussion trying to shut down any debate or condemnation by screaming `` racist ! ''
[native] - more chance of the conservative government getting elected again next year , with a mandate to renegotiate the eu treaties and have a referendum - more immigration from the rest of the eu to the uk - calls from the rest of the eu to copy the uk 's quantitive easing programme - potentially increased euscepticism within the uk : what is the point of being in a political and economic union with a stagnating continent ?
[native] > if you 'd bring information spots in tv , most people would just change the channel , or they would not even consider watching these channels and instead watch their dumb reality soaps ... then they can ignore news media altogether , because it should only be giving them information .
[non-native] in conclusion , i strongly believe that as the people get older they enjoy the life less because of a number of limitations that aging brings to them .i can not say if there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today , because there are a lot of things to take into account to have an opinion .
[native] if they do n't get their shit together , in 30 years poland may very well surpass them in strength '' ** spain and italy will recover , they are major export markets for germany and it 's always been the unspoken eu rule that germany leads economically and france/uk lead politically ( foreign policy ) .
[non-native] i.e young or old ) , but , it is the attitudes of the people which determine how much they enjoy their life .i agree with the statement , because only people who risk and do n't keep doing always the same things have some possibility to improve their own economic or social condition .
[native] i might just be biased because of past experiences , i formed my love of microfibre when managing a campground with cabins that had a very high turnover , the laundry situation was an absolute nightmare because even 30 mins to dry was too long .
[native] do n't you think that if you invite a bunch of people to your country to do the worst jobs for cheap and make sure that they know they do n't belong here ... do n't you think maybe they will realise they do n't belong here and become an angry , resentful underclass ?
[native] do n't get me wrong , i 'm not proposing we open up the borders or anything - but we need to be more proactive in preventing instability in poorer countries ( the french intervention in mali , or the australian intervention in the solomon islands immediately spring to mind ) whilst at the same time fulfilling our domestic and international legal obligations - processing asylum seekers , granting temporary or permanent protection visas as necessary to those deemed refugees , and deporting those deemed to just be illegal immigrants .
[non-native] when it is understood that what we are doing is wrong then the restrinctions will start , for instance forbidding cars on sundays or making it more expensive to drive because of the eccessive taxes on gas .life has various stages , each stage has there advantages and disadvantages , the topic of the essay is to write about `` do young people enjoy life more than older people do '' .
[native] what it appears some people do n't get is that yes , freedom of expression should n't be met with violence , but some actions are provocative and it 's confusing to think that ( as another commenter pointed out ) in a neighbourhood close to an area full of people from palestine , that someone would fly an israeli flag .
[non-native] their ability to cope with failure and their exploratory sense make them more affected to being truly unusual .first , i think that it is better to have knowledges of many academic subjects , because you tend to improve your critical mind more than when your are specialized , but in an other hand i think that a specialization may be benefic in some cases too .
[non-native] the problem we are focusing is that advertisements have only a positive message and they forget to show the negative points of the product , so a majorities of consumers event they known this bad side they are more influence by the positive side a the message bring by the advertisements .
[non-native] use your time wisely to be a better person .i belive the young people enjoy life more than older people , because young people always thinks that there are in the begining of there life and they have a long life in the future .
[native] out of where i 've been , * sweden ( visited the most ) , music , rights you have for the outdoors ( and how people are trusted to be responsible ) , your social democracy and not having so much pressure to be successful .
[non-native] traveling alone and experienceing the culture while becoming one with it is in my opinion , the best way to travel .the main meaning that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than learning facts is generally stated by the students themselves but almost rarely by universities or institutions .
[non-native] this gift of energy and physical power gives them the opportunity to fullfil their dreams , on the other hand , old people lack these traits .i agree with the statement most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are because the principal task of a marketing and branding executive is to improve new markets and to sell his product to them .
[non-native] for instance , when i was in high school i was not able to memorize the mathematical facts such as theorems but then i found it more easy to learn these theorems through learning certain concepts and ideas that are related to those facts .
[native] i understand that completely , and i can definitely see how it would be `` out of the question '' and distasteful for europeans to consider another ground war , however you must also balance that with a healthy understanding that rolling over will only beget more invasions .
[non-native] therefore , i strongly recommend and support the multiplicity of specializations for all people with concentrating on one of them .the comparison between the life of two different generations is always difficult , but it is possible to find reasons enough for living in both ages .
[non-native] a tour guide will take tourists to the most important parts of the ancient mayan site , and in detail will explain to the group the historic events , be it social , economic or intellectual , that led to the specific scenery the tourists are observing .
[non-native] for that reasons , i think that travel with a group led by a tour guide is the best option for new places and known places .i agree the following statement `` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . ''
[non-native] many ads maybe exaggerate their effects , for example , the advertising pictures showed on the internet do have some difference from the original products , but since all of them are exaggerating in some level , considering that , they would be equal as well , which is understandable because every company has to beautify their products to make profits .
[native] i especially think that older christians have difficulty leaving their religion even when they 're disillusioned by it , because of the cognitive dissonance which results from coming to terms with the fact that they 've basically been completely wrong their entire lives is too much to cope with .
[native] eu ( integration , regulation , subsidising ) , nuclear energy , taxes , federal regulation , immigration ( both internal and external to eu ) , education , multiculturalism , gun control , international and intercontinental trade , nato , local governments , conservative/liberal societal values ( family , human rights , traditions , religion ) , national industry , federal/state debt ... you know , the usual basics when it comes to european countries .
[non-native] some young people who did n't find the right path or did n't have directions from the right persone nowadays does not give attention to the imprtant things in life or may be they give their community but not enough thats becouse the enviroment they were brougt to , they were born in a time were fun and entertatment is the main concern to everybody , they were born with technology and were distracted by big companies that only wants to benefits for it 's own , these big sharks the companies i mean did n't care enough about the new generation and how they think , they should take in to consederation that this generation is the world future it 's not the young people that they were treated this way .
[native] actually , economists are pretty confident that the optimal corporate tax rate for a company is 0 % - the taxes the corporation pays just get passed down to the public , hinder investment , job and wage growth , and is an inefficient way of collecting taxes .
[non-native] however , i really do not agree with this opinion , if i am supposed to choose between risky life and safe life , i will choose the risky life without any hesitation because adventrous life is more exciting and less boring , and most successful people took a tremendous risk for succeed to their job .
[native] yet out of the five more intelligent countries you mention , two think being in the eu is a bad idea , four have avoided joining the euro , and one has just placed immigration limits on european migration ( in defiance of treaty agreements ) .
[non-native] all in all , the best education is probably the one complementing general knowledge learned in school with specialized knowledge learned during professional life .i personally travelled a lot in my life because i think its one of the best way to learn about diversities and cultures .
[non-native] even thougy they realize facilities , if they can not take risks , they can not be sucessful and also it is not possible that they improve themselves .i agree with the viewpoint that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
[non-native] it 's also help you to get ride of stress , make your life easier and help you stay and live longer .some people think that it is more important for students to understnad ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
[non-native] of course , although they were used to try old thing , people trying new things concernd with economial behavior could have more risk rather than others , however , people chalanging more risk and new things obtain economically money such as successful people .
[non-native] all in all i think it is important to have both , to specialize in one subject but to have the wide rage of all subjects at the same time .it is widely believed that young people enjoy their lives more than older people do .
[native] - i also think epp are probably aware that the consequences of pushing fidesz out of the the epp are quite uncertain and could have a further destabilising effect on the political situation in hungary and lead to further gains by jobbick , increased hungarian euscepticism .
[native] just because their are a certain amount of obese people in america does n't mean the caricature of all americans being obese is true , that would mean literally every or a vast majority if americans are obese which is not the case , ntm uk , canada , aus , are all around the same area .
[native] i think coding as we know it will die a slow death over the coming decades , but there 's still plenty of time before that happens , and if you 're in the industry you can be part of the change instead of being killed by it .
[non-native] pepole live only one life - as far as i know - stoping yourself from doing any thing in your life in un questionable if you answer this question : how many times you will live ?nowadays , people are getting busier and busier with their own bussiness , especially the young people who are fighting hard for their future .
[non-native] one can choose not to force his son and let him stay all day in front of a computer or in front of television or one parent can make the choise of spend time explaning to his son the importance and the lovely sensation that hammer out in helping others , that i sto say in helping communities .
[non-native] secondly , in the childhood you learn all the subjects as your acedamics but as you grow older you have to select some spefic subjects and learn them , it is only because one can not master all the subjects and get good knowledge about everything .
[non-native] finally , it is good to conclude by saying that we all have to pay a lot of attention to things that are advertised on the means of communication , we have to do this because we might buy something that , at the beginnig , we did not even want it .
[native] i made the same argument emergency_poncho made , that maybe sweden was willing to give up some ground on the cap in exchange for benefit elsewhere , and if sweden did n't do any such thing then maybe they should 've sent better eu negotiators .
[native] that 's because you 've bought into insane things that the cultural commissars in many of these european nations have been selling like cultural relativism along with weird `` hate speech '' laws that are in effect de facto blasphemy laws used to silence those who are n't part of the ruling class .
[native] the astonishing thing about its last days is that none of its advocates expected what happened , and all of them had long since stopped believing in the unification of their country as anything more than the remotest of possibilities , if they thought of it at all .
[non-native] my conclusion is the following : you have to learn everything that you need but is better to undertand , everything that you want .`` youth is the essence of life '' , it indeed is , the best years of any persons life , in every kind of way , the youth of any person is indeed much more enjoyable , memorable and cherishable .
[non-native] i do n't know what i want to do in my future , i do n't know if i will have broad knowledge in many subjects or i specialize in one specific subject but i know that i hold my life in my hand and i want to use every occasion that will present to me .`` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities '' .
[non-native] for instance , when we analyzed the main reasons of imf period in early 2000 in korea , we had to utilize such many academic knowledge as politics , economics , socialogy , statistics , international economics and finance to get the correct answer .
[non-native] eventually , a teenager will grow and change , so will his interests and his way of enjoying life .`` understanding gives you a better clarity and vision rather than learning facts '' , i agree to the point that understanding ideas and concepts has a better results than simply learning it .
[non-native] i personally research on the internet before buying an expencive product what other people think about it or experienced with the product , and if there is a equal or even better product that is not so promoted like the other and therefore cheaper .some people are of the opinion that in general successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to well .
[native] i was seriously considering messaging you to get a few ... but realistically i 'm not in a good place to have new bunnies since i live in a clean freak flat , i 'm working , and plus i 'm probably going to move soon .
[native] yes , i said i supported that , just because i knew the kind of hubbub that would eventuate from it across the media leading to new ways of thinking about democracy , not because i thought that meps voting in secret would be a direct democratic benefit .
[non-native] first of all we know that life filled with problems and difficulties this is a fact and we ca n't say it 's not true at all , so from this point i think that old people have got borred from the life and it 's difficulties , they have saw too many people and too many places and the joyfull things for the young will ahve no test to them .
[native] the difference is golds value as a commodity increased over time while backed with its actual utility use as a material for jewelery and later electronics whereas bitcoin has no material function , rather its function is as a transactional element which would not be a problem if it had any stable value but due to the speculative investment around it holders are motivated to retain their ownership of them in the hopes of further rise in value until the stage where they are declining in which case merchants are motivated against accepting them knowing they will be worth less than the item sold soon after trading it .
[native] so i am still curious that how the eu , under the situation i described where google has 0 persons , companies , offices , servers or any other part of their company within the eu , would be able to try and force the us to freeze the assets of an american company that is not breaking any laws in the us .
[non-native] and i do not think that a broad academic knowledge distracts one 's focus , thus gaining experience is harder with that kind of knowledge , than the case with a specialisation field .in the world of bissnes the mony is the bice , so if you think you are doing the good idea you sould do it .
[non-native] that is why i do not think it is fair to assert that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject : to my mind , both specialists and generalists people are necessary in the society , and extensive knowledge of a precise topic can be as helpful as more restricted knowledge in more fields .have you ever heard about the word like `` pal-bang-mi-in '' ?
[native] the judge was highly critical of former financial regulator pat neary and remarked `` it seems to me it would be most unjust to imprison these two gentlemen when it seems to me a state agency has led them in error and illegality '' .
[native] the phillipines has call-centres serving english-speaking countries , and it is an official language , and a former us colony , and this http://www.economist.com/blogs/johnson/2013/04/business-english pakistan seems to have fallen into a void , somewhere between asia and the middle east , although to most people in england `` pakistani '' and `` asian '' are synonyms .
[native] and it 's odd that there 's a woman from gibraltar with the absolute same abrasive style of writing , who showed up shortly after the last one was banned , with the same interests and political views , but they 're not the same person .
[non-native] all the time is spent at work , or watching tv , or going around pubs and so on and we forget the most important things of life , like having respect of it or being happy for things that life gives us every day .
[non-native] as a result , to define a people is success or not , we should not only consider he/she if she tried new things or not , but also think of the other ways , such as if he has a high education or not .everybody has its own point of view on a certain issue and its not neccessary that the my point of view may corrobarate with other or say in accord with other .
[native] no-one 's yet found a correlation between toxicity and amount of the stuff eaten - so you get pitbulls who have toxic effects from four or five grapes , and bichons that eat a whole bowl and do n't suffer any effects at all .
[native] there was one in july 2012 which caused a massive solar flare , ( recorded by one of the two satellites we have - one at each lagrange point - to observe the sun ) had it hit earth it likely would have destroyed large parts of the global power grid - quite possibly leading to `` many fukushimas '' all at the same time .
[non-native] but other advertisements seems to offer a very good product that is n't so good : i think about our tv advertises , that try to capture people with all kind of words , for example by saying that product is used only by the best people , or it'is saled only for best shops , or by a very famous testimonial like the most favourite character of cinema to capture different type of target ( from teenagers to older people ) .
[native] they have purchased 128 leopard 2a4 tanks from germany with plans for 128 more 2a4s or 2a5s , [ 48 block 52 f-16s ] ( http://www.defensenews.com/article/20140301/defreg01/303010023/as-poland-pursues-stealth-jets-eurofighter-flies-into-picture ) , jassm [ long range low-observability cruise missiles ] ( http://theaviationist.com/tag/agm-158-jassm/ ) with a range of 370km , and have plans for a sams ( french or us probably ) and may [ purchase f-35s or tranche 3b eurofighters ] ( http://www.defensenews.com/article/20140301/defreg01/303010023/as-poland-pursues-stealth-jets-eurofighter-flies-into-picture ) .
[non-native] if you take little bits of everything , it does not give you depth understading and it does not help you a lot , however if you decrease the range and study deeply about all the subjects around your profession , it will give you lots of credit , it also might related to other big subjects as well .
[non-native] afterwards , these young people will get older and they will get married and they will have children and then they will teach their children how to be good person and help to develop the community and these children will grow up to be more helpful to their community
[native] the battle of the atlantic was at its peak from mid-1942 to mid-1943 , with submarine wolf packs sinking so many ships that the allies were on the verge of defeat , so shipping could not be spared for india '' it is worth remembering that at this time , britain was at war with the nazi 's , their presence in asia had been greatly reduced and india was largely in control of its affairs .
[native] we should make a solution which is more acceptable to eurosceptics in the future , but unfortunately those who are eurosceptic generally will not accept much compromise and in the absence of any ability to compromise we must follow what the majority want , which is more europe and not less , as proved by the election results .
[native] regardless , while i 'd shy away from calling putin ` evil ' ( aside from my partially facetious use of it earlier ) , the actions committed under his government and on his orders over the past almost two decades can only be described as undoubtedly harmful and often detrimental in the extreme to western liberal-democratic ideals , which is why people have such a strong distaste for putin .
[non-native] automotive factory are trying to satisfy customers needs with specific kind of cars and give to them the possibility to chose almost everything in a car , for example the colour and the material of the seats , the colour of the whole car , and also the model of the engine : diesel or not .
[non-native] firstly , it is correct that young generation is enjoying the life more than the older at that time but as the time passes the young generation has to enter the older generation and that same young generation now again takes some pleasures in enjoying life in older age also thus if we calculate the enjoyment by comparing the older person to young one then we will find that older ones has enjoyed more on the scale of time .
[native] so southern european economies are in free fall , and dependent on bailout money which they are being given in exchange for austerity , and it is turning out that austerity was potentially the wrong method ( see , imf reports , who initially advocated austerity ) .
[native] in particular , there 's one ad with a photo of a young aboriginal boy in his late teens in shabby clothes in a hotel room , the photo has been taken by another person and the ad promises that he 's tight , that unprotected anal sex is available , and the price and drugs provided for the `` party '' will be be negotiated .
[native] if you look at someone who is three , they have to go to childcare , primary , secondary and higher education so this is a figure for the next 20 years . '' the challenge would require up to 25,000 more teachers , mr dohmen said .
[native] > the ` yes ' campaign believes their polling figure is underestimated because they are picking up support from this section of society in working class areas , where people generally have n't registered to vote before , do n't have a landline for phone polls , or do n't choose to take part in online polls .
[non-native] for example if you are traveling with your children you may be would like a place so that both , parents and children , can have fun together , in the case of a young couple may be they prefer going to a casino , and things like that .
[native] yeah , i 'm a rabid antisemite , let 's just ignore that i said antisemitism was a problem and needed to be stamped out [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2aw2r8/antwerp_rally_calls_for_slaughter_of_jews/cizly6v ) , [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2awjyy/belgium_shop_owner_refuses_to_sell_to_jews/cizlfwn?context=3 ) , and [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2awjyy/belgium_shop_owner_refuses_to_sell_to_jews/cizl4cu?context=3 ) .
[non-native] after careful observation and sufficent evidence i strongly agree that many products are of less standard than the thwey are advertised .most people are considering which is better for them between having broad knowledge of many academic subjects and having knowledge in one specific subject .
[native] haha , in australia sex/adult industry workers are taxed and can claim deductions from common costs : https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals/income-and-deductions/in-detail/deductions-for-specific-industries-and-occupations/adult-industry-workers---claiming-work-related-expenses/?page=3#common_expenses_for_adult_industry_workers it actually goes into some detail : > * dance lessons * > you can claim a tax deduction for the cost of classes you take to maintain your existing dance skills or to learn new dance skills .
[native] [ the ruins of tintagel castle ] ( http://ih2.redbubble.net/image.9122144.7775/flat,550x550,075,f.u1.jpg ) a medieval fortress built upon cornwall 's tintagel peninsula , it has been mythologised as the birth place of the legendary king arthur since geoffrey of monmouth 's ` historia regum britanniae ' ( history of the kings of britain ) was written in the 12th c. ----------------------------------- london deserves it 's own list , so i 've not included london sites here .
[non-native] something happened to our culture that inverted the place of old people in our society , placing the young and brave on top while older people is seen as dumb and slow , to the point to pretend that they do n't enjoy life .
[non-native] for example a student that has to give a presentation infront of the class and has not only to show his fellow students what he learned from the various lessons but even how he uses the knowledge he owns to formulte his own hypothesis needs to know all the basic facts on the topic or his presentation might result full of conceptual holes and lacking important concepts that in the end would impair the student to construct his own opinion and to give a thorough presentation .
[native] but perhaps that 's just because my british mate ( who 's a libertarian eurosceptic , so you can imagine the heated discussions we have down at the pub ) constantly relays to me stories from 4chan about the fucked up shit people do and write only because they 're anonymous .
[native] the other countries are considerably less threatened and vulnerable to russia ( both economically and physically ) , yet they refuse to consider the possibility on the basis that it would harm their economic interests - frances contracts for battleships , for the uk it 's protecting the city , and for germany it 's merkel 's staunch refusal to change the relationship she established with moscow almost a decade ago .
[non-native] in our day to day life we see so many changes , the thing you see today might no be there tommorow , when we talk about technologies the above statement is true , however there are few subjects , where they remain constant , for example history , the term itself describes about past actvity .
[non-native] keeping the youth on the inside of the house rather than giving them the opportunity of working for exemple with elders , or playing more outside we think that if the working time were less compulsive give the chance to famillies to have quality time , things will change .
[non-native] so lets go and for your next holidays : be your own tour guide !in twenty years , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today , because of limited natural resources , improved transportation services and financial disadvantages of using cars .
[non-native] another situation to consider will be , when one masters only specific subject without giving considerate attention to his other subjects , will lead him to a situation where he 'll excel in his subject area conversations but at the same time , he 'll not be in a situation to participate in a conversation about any other topic which is not his subject .
[native] edit : so , for people asking , they do get paid a 52 week year including many many bonuses such as appearance bonus , unused sub bonus , signing on bonus , goal bonus ( clean sheet bonus for keepers ) , maybe a yearly wage rise and possibly many more non-standard ones and image rights .
[non-native] i agree to the point that there would be decrease in the number of cars in the coming twenty years but not in the number of people driving cars or the reduction in car manufacturing , there would be the decrease in the type of cars driven today , more technology oriented cars would be launched giving a marked competetion to the cars of today .
[non-native] i 'm talking about all the stories we read on the internet or books about poor people who decide to change their lifes drastically , maybe starting a new business , or `` playing '' at the stock exchange market , and suddendly create an empire ( did n't bill gates start in a garage , did he ? )
[native] he sees himself as the victim , and he believes that he 's owed `` compassion '' and that the right thing for me to do is to allow him to call me my old male name , even though it hurts to hear it .
[non-native] but now both , company and customer have got advantages of this solution .it would be logical to think that as population increases , the number of vehicles on the roads would also increase as there exists a correlation between the two of these variables .
[non-native] in conclusion ; it is very clear to see that understanding ideas and concepts is more important for students than learning facts by reading the two supports written on this passage .traveling from one place to another is a good experiemce for everyone 's life .
[native] plus the right has their circlejerk over in kiwiblog , trademe forums , and whaleoil ... this is our only place to circlejerk ( let 's face it that 's what people do , regardless of political allegiance ) , so maybe you should calm your tits and stop writing us all off as conspiracy theorists .
[non-native] the only which changed is that tey can go faster , that they have much more options like gps or abs and we feel more secure in it , itwenty years ther will be more cars than now maybe because new one are going to be constructed .
[non-native] in specific , since participating in local communities can provide the youngs with some neccesary and useful experiences from real world , such as skills needed for processing certain job , taking part in local activities does n't mean only doing bothering tasks for the young valenteers any more .
[native] there is a big difference between welcoming and helping legitimate refugees who need the help and just opening the borders wide and saying the whole world can stay as long as they get their foot in the door and are free to walk around and pick whatever country and town they 'd like to live in .
[native] it was put to a public vote actually , and ireland 's favourite painting is [ hellelil and hildebrand , the meeting on the turret stairs ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tivw3hr.jpg ) by frederic william burton * this richly coloured watercolour painting depicts the ill-fated lovers hellelil and hildebrand , meeting on the stone stairway of a medieval tower .
[native] i mean , even in the article i submitted their account of what happened is wildly different to his , where he brushes it off as merely > actually they got in a drunken verbal fight with a well-known `` comedian '' , shouted some slurs , and afterwards armed themselves with blunt objects `` supposedly '' ( i personally doubt it ) because they had been threatened with getting a criminal gang set on them .
[native] these countries repress islamic religious groups ( whether connected with terrorism or not ) routinely , they 're essentially brutal dictatorships if you 're not part of the in group ( one of the guys has built a cult of personality worse than those of north korea ) , there 's no press freedom .
[non-native] there are undoubtedly many advantages to be very focused on a specific subject ; for example many scientific discoveries would not have been found unless there were some people that studied a lot a precise and narrow domain , such as sub-nuclear physics or organic chemistry .
[native] or is it that it 's only here where some people are silly enough for your conspiracy and error laden posts about how the ttip is evil , how you completely misrepresent the gats ( and which i 've corrected you on a number of times ) , etc ?
[native] ah , sorry i guess when i said `` europe '' what i really meant ( prepare to be offended and i 'm * sorry in advance * ) was `` germany '' and yes i know germany has lots of lovely immigrants , but their population is still slated to shrink .
[non-native] as we go on trying the new things it will be very usefull for the person to gain experince and also he can be able to solve the problems on his own with out taking the help of others , he can even face the risks so that he will be used to it and find easy to do well .
[non-native] this broad knowledge can help you anytime and you will not have to depend on others in every single thing out of your specialize subject and it will make you a well-known person who has an experience in everything you want to learn about .
[native] obviously , if the parliament values the legislation as a whole more than its amendments , it might agree to pass it without the amendments if the commission wo n't accept them , making the whole thing come down to a game of chicken .
[native] i then took the number of times each word identified was used over the last year per subreddit and divided them by the subreddit populations ( which i gathered by going to the subreddits in question and adding their populations to the formula . )
[native] if other countries lose confidence in our ability to protect them , they will start acting preemptively and without consulting us , which will make us less influential and will make the world a more dangerous place because everyone will be out for themselves .
[non-native] take a easy thing for example , when you get up in the morning , you must use your weather knowledge , if you see the black cloud around the sky you will know it will rain , though it is a little thing , it really uses the knowledge you had from the book .
[non-native] perhaps both groups enjoy and spend their time in different ways but in total i am sure that both are able to enjoy at a similar level .i think that in twenty years there wo n't be fewer cars than there are today , i think they will be different .
[native] i do n't think this is europe 's mentality but it * can * seem , due to the way some news articles are phrased , that europe is basically expecting the united states to carry the majority of the weight if this situation gets any uglier .
[non-native] all in all , i can not disagree or agree with this statement , because for me both are very important facts for being successful !i think an old saying of `` jack of all and master of none '' , in my opinion doesnot have much standing as times are changing fast and your considered fit in the circles you move when you can comprehend and also contribute .
[native] there 's nothing clandestine or shady about it , but if you 're coming up with a deal that 's going to change tens of billions of dollars in trade , then you definitely want to get a sense of how it would effect various stakeholders , and those stakeholders give input on those elements of a treaty .
[native] the quote says > `` by organizing such events , estonian power structures are in fact , working on `` hitler-jugendization '' of the younger generation , romanticizing fascist executioners and executioners of nazi crimes for young people '' i ca n't parse any of this , it makes no sense to me .
[native] i find it somewhat amusing that people will readily admit that housing different cultures together in refugee centres and camps is causing multiple episodes of friction and violence , but then at the same time adamantly argue that multicultural diversity is inherently great and sustainable with no integration problems that ca n't be explained away by socioeconomic factors .
[non-native] now take another example of another buisness tycoon , say ratan tata in india again , he has always been in the steel buisness and i do say he has done good in his carrer but again to compare relliance is far mor ahead tha tata .
[native] the german greens know one thing you do n't and that is that we could easily be thrust tomorrow into an [ unspeakable disaster of dozens of simultaneous nuclear meltdowns ] ( https://www.nirs.org/reactorwatch/natureandnukes/petrulemaking262011.pdf ) if we get another solar storm like the `` carrington '' one in 1859 .
[native] if these regimes have legitimate majority support then as a democrat you have no choice but to tolerate them , if the turks genuinely voted in ergodan by means of a fair election then you have no grounds to declare his rule illegitimate , unless you ( paradoxically ) want to go against your democratic principles to support governments which do n't have the support of their people .
[native] i checked and you 're right , not only is `` thineselves '' not even a word but it would n't be `` thine selves '' either , according to [ this ] ( https://www.cummingsstudyguides.net/xthou.html ) the word is thyself , and i was probably thinking of the shakespearean phrase `` thine own self '' .
[native] here 's some points from [ the telegraph :] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11008167/boris-to-raise-questions-over-britains-eu-membership.html ) * boris johnson ( london mayor ) will throw his weight behind a major report which says that it would be better for london if britain were to leave the european union than stay ** if david cameron fails to negotiate reforms .
[native] of course , i knew that that is how they are seen , but i also feel as if its a huge mistake to allow any potentially corrupt leadership of any country , carte blanche to sign away the interests of a people , forever , in exchange for god knows what kind of bribery .
[native] but canada kind of cleaned up this year : [ sorry-justin bieber ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frh_vgs2dfe ) [ ca n't feel my face-the weeknd ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kei4qsrkpas ) [ hotline bling-drake ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxpda-c-4mc ) [ stitches-shawn mendes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbfpw0pbvau ) [ the hills-the weeknd ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yztuburdaya ) also the video for hello by adele was shot in quebec by a canadian director , so we 're taking partial credit .
[non-native] according to me everybody lives in this world but if u want to create a mark or achieve something or have that satisfaction within , that '' i am different '' and want to be remembered u need to try out all what u can rather than just sticking on to one thing and try to make something out of it. '' winners are not quitters '' .
[native] when the united states recovered all the ground it lost in 2012 , while the eurozone had a double-dip recession that it only came out of last year , still looks like it 'll have nothing but stagnant growth for the next couple years & continues to exist on the verge of deflation .
[non-native] therefore , in conclusion , despite the hectic schedules of comteporary young people , i still think that many youth sincerely wants to contribute to their communities and help to make the world a better place for all homo sapiens to live in , regardless of race , language or religion .i disagree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
[native] i ca n't remember where it was ( maybe the abc v ireland echr judgement , or the un upr of ireland 's human rights ) , but the state admitted that they do n't keep records of how many ectopic pregnancies are treated that way ( instead lumping it in with ` pregnancy complications ' or something ) , so it was n't possible to actually say how many ` abortions ' / ` terminations of pregnancy ' there were .
[native] if the scots of the american south could be inspired by the homeland they 're so damned proud of to take steps towards building an education , healthcare , and criminal justice system that the people in their homeland want to build , it will permanently shift the ground in american politics .
[non-native] i think in twenty years there will be more cars in use as factories produce more and more cars in order to earn more money , and as our need of cars is markedly increase either as a good way of transportation , or as a gift .the issue of that it is true young people enjoy life more than older people do is controversial because on the one hand young people generally are more likely to be healthy and have energy , and on the other hands older people in certain conditions have more time and money to dedicate to their hobbies and their relatives .
[native] the tories are cowards who shit themselves when the tabloid-reading morons started buying into that narrative and so , rather than leading by example and pointing to current policy and economic scientists who could verify that benefit tourism was actually largely a non-issue , immigration benefitting the country , and that we had bigger problems to face at any rate , they instead decided to pander to the ill-informed and the anti-eu crowd within their own party .
[native] socialist parties which fail to prove by all their activities now , as well as during the revolution and after its victory , that they will free the enslaved nations and establish relations with them on the basis of a free union -- and a free union is a lying phrase without right to secession -- such parties would be committing treachery to socialism .
[non-native] although scientists and many politicians have talked about the incoming shortage of oil since the early 1990s , we have actually felt the first sign of a bigger crisis in the years to come as the barrel price of oil reached over $ 70 last year .
[native] it 's replacing the f-18 , f-16s and harriers and is vastly superior in those roles , its designed for cas and bvr along with sensor fusion and data sharing over the battlefield , although its high off-bore sighting does provide some tricks for wvr .
[non-native] lastly on a broader note , for a society to evolve and progress in culture and education we need new ideas , new concepts because if we do not develop new ideas we would still believe that earth was flat and was the center of the universe , this way of thinking would have had a detrimental effect on humans as a whole and we would still be living like animals .the main purpose of advertisements is to attract potential customers .
[non-native] in conclusion , undersatnding ideas nad concepts in some areas is much more important than leraning facts becasue it is helpful to use and develop it outside classroom since it helps people to be creative .yes for some what reason it may be true because from one point of view young people will be strong ang will have enough stamina to enjoy by going to trips etc.also they will have no family problems to bother about .
[native] but if scotland is keen to be in nato - a defence alliance that has nuclear weapons as a crucial part of it - it would seem a bit surprising that scotland was also committed to not having nuclear weapons on its territory and causing england , wales and northern ireland a gigantic expense .
[native] we 're irish today , european tomorrow , and maybe one day , for my children 's children , we 'll just be people and borders wont matter and we wont have to worry about so many of the shitty , petty , irrational problems we have today .
[non-native] thus , as can be seen as above , i certainly believe that learning facts is more important for students than just understanding ideas and concepts in that there are many cases that understaing ideas and concept would not be sufficience .the question is being asked if the ideas and concepts are more important for the students than learning facts .
[native] let me give you an extreme example ( that i am certain you will think i 'm making up - and i forgive you in advance for it . . because nobody believe this , nor will you believe me when i tell you that ive been following this issue for 15 years and have been hearing these stories since the late 90s and they come from a lot of sources who have no reason to make it up .
[non-native] in this way we will have a greater in-sight into the subject and we will be in a position to contribute something from our side for the betterment of the subject .at first sight , i think successful people have to take risks because it is important , when we manage everywhere , to try new things to see if we succeed in these .
[non-native] having not taken the risk , the person would be still working an 8 hour shift with a small paycheck with huge risk taken and conferring the growth of the firm , the person now contributes to the economy by providing employment for a larger group resulting in more tax dollars to the treasury .
[native] not that i have any idea on the investment that is likely or occurring now , but is it not possible that relatively-more-developed developing countries ( like china ) will leapfrog us when it comes to building the required infrastructure as happens with manufacturing ?
[native] just to name a few reasons : [ a pure ad hominem ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/windowsphone/comments/4b7mh5/microsoft_breaks_its_windows_10_mobile_upgrade/d16qxzy ) , [ slippery slope ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/windowsphone/comments/4b0pbv/so_for_those_who_arent_in_the_win10_cool_kids/d154g6t ) , [ the `` it 's old '' non-argument ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/windowsphone/comments/4axeh2/ms_suspected_back_in_nov_2015_that_x20_devices/d14btgc ) , and finally your `` i honestly do n't know where all the complaints have been coming from '' comment here .
[native] canada imposed the ban * despite * both the canadian health and environmental department not supporting the ban ( in fact , they said that it posed no danger to human health ) if i remember about the metalclad case as well , it was that when the mexican state privatized the assets they agreed to take on all health liabilities arising from the near century of pollution at the site .
[non-native] some people say that it is better to have broad knowledge of many acamic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject , i totally agree with this given statement because by having broad knowledge of many academic subjects , people can develop thier general knowlege and able to good oppotunities to find their potential ability in the future .
[non-native] the place is also a master peace of this marketing strategy because you have to see which is the type of consumer you want to sell , either is to a very high educated class or to the non-smokers or whorever is the choise .
[native] i use words like ` doomsaying ' about those speaking out about it ( in general , not specifically to people here ) because as someone that 's taken masters level subjects on international negotiation , as well as finishing a masters thesis related to trade liberalization and negotiation , that 's how i view it .
[native] it 's such a different issue to ` people just need to changed their values to civic nationalism instead of ethnic nationalism ' ; it 's not a demand we place on our native peoples , so part of me feels like it 's wrong to place that demand on what are technically the native people of europe .
[non-native] but , in the other hand , an education base it only in facts is not good enought , because in the future , and maybe in the near future , the things that we consider true may change , and sometimes that occurs in a radical way .
[non-native] my type of category is the second one , so i would go with and agree to the statement - `` succesfull people try new things and take risks rather than doing what they already know how to do well. '' for their insatiable curiosity , always active and open , risk involved .
[non-native] even if those projects are n't all efficient by now , i clearly stand fast in my conviction that in the next twenty years , their efficiency will be enhanced by new scientific discoveries .in my opinion there are two oppositing points of view from which one could see the situation .
[native] admittedly i 'm talking about unrealistically high expectations of democracy , but that 's not the angle i was looking at it from , but rather of that of having a democracy where you do n't have pollies lying to you or misleading you .
[native] a stated goal of these terrorist movements is to get the west to turn against islam as a whole to stir up even more conflict , we 'd be playing right into their hands to treat it as a black and white `` islam vs the west '' issue .
[native] it 's just a fact , the legal definition of rape in sweden is one of the loosest in the world and the way statistics are done makes it seem like rape is considerably more prevalent in sweden than elsewhere ( as opposed to statistics in other countries which considerably under-report it ) .
[non-native] for these reasons , i agree with the idea that people should have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject .the issue at hand is , whether it is good to travel alone without a tour guide or in a group that is led by a tour guide .
[native] i used to be an unapologetic racist ( believer in racial ideology , nationalism , the whole lot ) , and it 's only because i got exposed to an extremely wide range of other streams of thought that i managed to get out of that rut .
[non-native] however , most advertisements make products seem much better than they are because this is the only way of selling the products .i strongly believe that , its better to have broad knowledge of several acadamic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
[native] if i bashed your head with a steel pipe , but then bashed your someone else 's head even harder ... you would still have a right to be pissed off , even though you did n't get hit as hard the next person .
[native] if i were you , i 'd try something like [ lang-8 ] ( http://lang-8.com/ ) for this - this sub is more for translating short phrases , one or two lines , rather than proofreading , and people are going to be put off by the length .
[non-native] my conclusion is that we surely better to have a board knowledge and many academic subjects in the brain than haveing blank in the head when you are doing some kind of test .i do not think that the best way to travel is with a group led by a tour guide .
[non-native] to conclude , i would like to say that an awareness of the advantages a person who helps his community has over a person who does n't engage in such activities , needs to be brought , not mention certain changes in their hectic work schedules as well !!i think it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
[non-native] for the above reason , i strongly believe that broad knowledge is better .the impact and influence of tv on people is so strong that some advertisements take advantage of this by hiding important details to the customers in order to sell their product .
[native] yes , as you say the minimum wage increase would not have been a violation of the contract , that 's rather supporting evidence for their case that the contract was broken ( namely that they did n't get compensation for wage stability guarantees or some such ) .
[native] it was taught in exactly the kind of fetishised way i think cameron intends ( he 's a product of very similar schooling , after all ) , as something to be proud of but which was fundamentally not a symbol of struggle needed , but of how everything was already for the best in this best of all possible englands .
[native] sorry but while cnn does not have high quality reporting ( imo ) and some people say the guardian has an obvious bias ( i do n't read it often , personally ) , it 's very , very clear that rt is a straight-up propaganda machine and not actually a news organisation .
[native] > the determination of what an ` illegitimate ' use of such tools is , and the threshold of what would be considered a ` high ' download volume over a period of time , would need to take into account legitimate explanations in order to avoid false positives and to safeguard the fundamental rights of consumers -- such matters would be open to further industry discussion and agreement . ''
[native] there are other political games at play , but the basic idea is that if you starve the money supply to the gov ` t , it will either : * learn to spend on what matters * the corrupt will win , people will get pissed and throw the whole lot out that 's at least what the average `` small government '' tea party patriot believes ( not what their sponsors like the koch brothers want ) .
[non-native] finally , a proverb is there which says that `` do n't sail in two boats '' , with this , i can say that when ever we specialize in a subject , it would definetly lead us to a prosperous carrier and total humanity will be surely gained by the knowledge which we acquired in a subject .i agree with the following statements that `` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it id for them to learn facts . ''
[native] under the most radical gats defaults [ the default is public services must be privatized ] ( http://www.iatp.org/files/gats_and_public_service_systems.htm ) . . countries are literally trapped , they are forced by default to privatize all but a very small number of governmental core functions . .
[non-native] if the porpouse of your trip is of getting relax and get appart from people , it is better to take that trip alone , ad to discover and solve the doubts about the place alone , due to is tru that for reflexing and having peace there is nothing better than being alone , or with your family , without strange people .
[native] nope , between the loose ( very loose ) alliance of oligarchs who share ecnomic interest ( rothschilds + bankers etc. , vatican ( which is just a bank ) , european monarchs , oil companies ( which are tied to bankers ) etc. )
[native] if anything , it is a highly controversial and highly unlikely situation that there will ever be something like a ` unified european armed force ' , ( also , because of the concept of sovereignty ) but people on / r/europe talk about it all the time as if it is a foregone conclusion .
[non-native] that is for this three reasons that i believe that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .yes , i agree with the statement that only people who take risks will be successful .
[native] * the conclusion of the tppa negotiations being rushed through under urgency ( bypassing the democratic process ) in all negotiating countries for no reason other than ** election deadlines in the usa ** ( obama wants to ** conclude ** the tppa before the elections next year ) .
[native] when they pass pro-eu legislation , or make policy movements that you do n't agree with , you threaten to increase the price , which you know they ca n't afford , threaten to shut it off , resulting in death , or actually shut it off , resulting in death .
[non-native] however , instead of blaming the young generation , something has to be done so that young people get encouraged to be a part of a community and get active .i believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
[non-native] even though i do not think that two decades is enough time to concious people about this worrying issue , i believe that politicians will get to an agreement in which they will look for the population 's protection , since it is an issue which concerns us all .
[native] new york gives 17.7 % of it 's gdp to the federal government ; the federal government spends on new york an amount equal to 10.4 % of its gdp in new york ; this means that ( to use your phrasing ) the 7.3 % figure in the new york case is how much money is collected from new york by the united states that is not used in new york in relation to its gdp .
[non-native] that means , teachers should use the following process to better explain a concept during class : first , mention the background of the idea ; second , explain the idea what is about , including examples and consequences ( if any ) ; and third , translate this concept in a realistic or insightful situation where students will be related with .
[non-native] for that reason i think that undertanding ideas alone without application in real life , is not much a good method as it is the applicability in already lived cases .i think the community has to help itself , it is not only a moral obligation of young people !
[native] i wonder why when they ask bullshit leading questions : > do you agree that quebec should become sovereign after having made a formal offer to canada for a new economic and political partnership within the scope of the bill respecting the future of quebec and of the agreement signed on june 12 , 1995 ?
[non-native] we have the chance to make our lives better and we have to pursue it no matter what .over the pass serval years , there is an common phenomenon that teachers in high schools , or even in the elementry schools try to make up the idea of teaching students concepts on some hard courses .
[non-native] students need to understand the idea of a concept , then only he can learn the facts for variety of topics in day to day life , not only in studies but must understand the importance oh their lives , as life teaches them to experience many things , and from there they should learn the ideas , because a person learns more from experiences . ..i agree with the statment saying that its better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than yo specilize in one specific subjet .
[native] * i always love these ` revelations ' - show how much the us still believes the problem with europe ( empires , european union , european federation ) is with whichever eurocrat is barking at the time , rather than face the reality that it is all of european civilisation and culture that is the problem .
[non-native] he felt that he was putting his future at stake if he would carry on helping his community and he was not even sure that if tomorrow he would be in a problem whether somebody would be there in times when he would be in crisis .
[native] the same guy overruled a court decision to block jewish holocaust refugees ( they had claimed that too many at once would be difficult to deal with for an already struggling nation - ireland was in the midst of an economic war with britain ) .
[native] i recall reading an oecd report some time ago that showed that sweden was the worst in the western world at utilizing immigrant labour - that is , the old story of ` professors working as taxi drivers ' thing largely held true for sweden , and what 's more , studies have shown that those that have traditional swedish surnames are considerably more likely to be called in for an interview than those without .
[native] since you are n't going to italy , a eurail pass might be worth it , what you need to do is find out the cost of point-to-point tickets ( search on bahn.de , raileurope.com or similar sites ) and compare with the cost of a pass , plus reservation fees where applicable .
[native] regardless , negotiators know that the agreement will have to pass 28 national parliaments plus the ep , and they saw what happened with acta , so only if they 're really stupid ( a hint : they 're not ) will they be insensitive to the needs of the public in general .
[non-native] for example , the number of young people who decide to do a voluntary social service , helping and taking care of mentally and physically challenged people , or do an ecological service by fighting polution by putting information out or cleaning up the countryside , restoring national parks .
[native] no , i 'm also talking about out of pocket charges . . and i suspect you are out of the us , maybe have not been here in a few years . . or you have employer coverage , which have low co pays . . obamacare is a completely different animal .
[native] i do n't think our stance on europe is about us still looking for our place in the world since the collapse of the empire , just a recognition that , being an island , our history has been slightly different ( though entwined ) .
[native] hmmmm ... it 's intriguing ... i might be interested , although i 'm not sure what you 'll think of my voice ( androgynous , four octave range , strong british ( west country ) accent ) , whether it 'll suit your lyrics/theme .
[non-native] in order to fulfill the goal of the institution and also to make sure educate students in the way where they are able to use and apply their knowledge in their everyday life , the school should teach and the students should tend to learn ideas and concepts rather than just to learn facts because it is much more important .there are many aspects that are done on the the students to make them learn and tow essential ways that students follow and do while they are learning .
[native] european animals and insects introduced to australia had a * devastating * effect on the local environment , it 's a very good decision on behalf of the eu to ban more imports until india fixes this problem and even as per your article , they say there is a risk to a number of european crops if some of these get introduced . .
[non-native] many sciological and economical facts prove this , first , to find a good job you have to develop as much as you can of skills that bring the satisfaction of your employer so the knowledge of many subjects will permit you to be on the top .
[native] all our stats are pretty much better than all the european countries with a few exceptions , we earn more ( beaten by norway and switzerland ) , live longer ( except for norway ) , more of us are tertiary educated , our economic growth is better , our social cohesion is fantastic , our government debt is laughably small in comparison , we achieve better in school with higher pisa ranks ( except for finland , vittun suomalaiset !
[non-native] this is the case , for instance , of highly technical degrees such as engineering or physics , which in a number of cases bring , along with a remarkable level of technical preparation in their respective fields of interest , the development of a very specialised and unflexible mindset which is ideal for solving problems in that particular area of activity , but can prove to be rather inefficient when issues outside that particular field of specialization arise .
[non-native] as an example you could take historic dates : what if a student could tell you every date of battles on european territory between the 15th and the 19th century but ca n't conclude any connection with international relations in that time from these facts .
[native] i refuted your arguments and you did n't respond - you just tried a bit of character assassination ( the third time you tried to dismiss an argument without addressing it ) and said you liked my `` ideals '' , whatever the fuck that means .
[non-native] that will contribute in reducing the pollution as the same time it gives benefit to the people that have interest on it .according to the topic given above this essay which mainly looks at inspiring people to decide weather taking new risks will rule or satisfied with the work which they already know them how to do well .
[native] currently , gas is sold on long term tale-or-pay contracts ( if a country 's storage tanks are full , they have to continue to pay a certain amount for gas that they do not even buy ) that include a ` no-resale ' clause , meaning that germany can not resell russian gas to poland for example .
[non-native] although , arguments can be made for both the sides of this statement , i think there are more advantages for the students by understanding ideas and concepts as compared to the learning based on facts .successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well , because it will give them a new perspective for certain aspects .
[native] and we have this huge question mark , will the big drought in the southwest continue , if it does , we 're going to have to figure out a way to get literally millions of people and hundreds of thousands of farms , desalinated seawater or water shipped from other parts of the country .
[non-native] in summary , i believe that successful people are willing to take risks and are eager to try new things because of their natural characterstics of self-improvement and from the knowledge of the benefits of such actions .working with group is one of the best way to improve the community .
[native] putting aside the current war drums , can we objectively say that the situation for them is more dangerous now than during the cuban missile crisis , during able archer , during afghanistan , during the numerous revolutions in the warsaw pact countries that the ussr suppressed ?
[native] you 'll miss me sometimes , when you do get me you 'll fail to convince people who either agree with me , sympathize with me , or have the cognitive faculty to recognize the irrelevance of the screenshot in a completely separate discussion , and over time , you will start to make an ass out of yourself , and alienate people in the subreddit to the point where people have just as much of a problem with `` that obnoxious guy who wo n't stop posting that screenshot '' as they do with `` that crazy guy who screams about right to live '' - with the difference being that the people you 've alienated are the intellectuals , and the ones i 've alienated are the dumb fucks who ca n't contribute anything except idiotic statements like `` nobody would prefer a shitty life over death herp derp . ''
[non-native] they will not lose because it is good to have broad knowledge it is like general knowldge even i can use in the test or in exam if they ask to me that about world or anything that about general knowledge or broad knowledge of many academic .
[non-native] that way all customers will be happy with their product , and possibly buy more from that company , so both the business and the buyer will be satisfied .i agree with the given statement which states that the most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
[native] when russia defaulted in 1998 ( because it took on all the debts of the former ssrs and could n't handle it , people like to forget that little fact ) under yeltsin 's government , it was legitimately on the verge of splintering * again * .
[non-native] yes , it means that you will not be able to jump and run around as much as you would like , you will have to see the doctor a little more often than you used to , and you may have to cut out on certain flavors you are so used to have .
[native] well , all the french was pretty uneccessary , but from what i understand it looks like this guy is saying that he does n't remember any other european country with a vaccine campaign like this , nor the us due to religious fundamentalists , and that he sees this working in croatia and that the rest of the eu will as such adopt the policy .
[native] if relations were ever good between nato and russia , there would have never been a need for a `` reset '' between the us and russia to start with ... on the other hand , russia shoulders a significant amount of the responsibility as well - it often refused cooperation with nato , it often actively worked against nato interests , and its attitude towards neighbouring states which are either nato or eu members , or prospective nato or eu members ( which is a problem in of itself in nato-russia relations ) has also contributed significantly in the rivalry between the two .
[native] so , you have * bucuresti - bucurestean * craiova - craiovean * iasi - iesean this gets more complicated with complex nouns , where rules differ : * sometimes , the first word is being used , the second dropped ( piatra neamt - pietrean ) * sometimes the first word is dropped , second used ( ramnicu valcea - valcean ) * sometimes both words are used ( alba iulia - albaiulian ) [ a list of them ] ( https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/list%c4%83_de_demonime_%c3%aen_limba_rom%c3%a2n%c4%83 )
[native] if you want to address the lack of food and medicine instead of the who knows pain more olympics , the only question is `` will there be more food and medicine in greece after a ` no ' vote , or less ? ''
[native] the guardian only made a spurious connection between the two , if one were to read the leaks they 'd see that what was actually happening was the eu negotiators said they were n't going to agree to any more stringent form of regulatory cooperation because they did n't want to be seen to be lowering standards .
[native] > unhappy with the prime minister 's refusal to sign protocol on return of debt in the next four months , putin two days after his visit to serbia , decided to reduce the supply of gas to one third of the total agreed amount .
[non-native] if every people will do the same thin this world will became a better place for everyone and people can enjoy the life without any age limitatons .all over the world , if we examine the present and past , there is two kind of person , one who serves their life in the known ways , just simply survives and the extreme ones who make new things try to find new ways and takes risks which can not be taken .
[non-native] thirdly , the help the community need also is an important factor i.e the type of help the community needs from the youngsters if the help is small there no need for all the young people to look after it and instead my best opinion wuould be to take the advise of some several senior wiser men of that community instaed of catching hold of young people yo get help .
[non-native] think about their needs and economical posibilities , and not get carried away by fantasies or advertisments in the few cases where the advert shows a product much better than it really is .the way for many students to reach good results is to learn facts and reproduce them when they are asked to .
[native] most of the canadians you will meet in florida live there for 6 + months of the year , so it would make sense that they would become more accustom to things in the usa and would adapt to the local people and become almost indistinguishable .
[native] they are vanessa sahinovic ( listed as severe , flown back to austria ) , luna pajer ( sustained injuries to her arm , unable to compete but stable ) , verena breit ( minor injuries , may still be able to compete ) .
[non-native] in conclusion , i totally disagree with the topic sentence and propose that the use on cars will increase and not decrease .yes , i agree with the following statement because it is more important for the students to understand the ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
[non-native] it is important to be interested in several things , that shows your ability to adapt yourself to different situations , and i do believe that being able to adapt yourself to a given situation is always a good point ; whatever you actually want to do in life .
[native] you 've given some good reasons why americans generally oppose socialised healthcare programmes , but the thing is , those quibbles are felt also by europeans both now , and when we were creating our welfare schemes , but it was felt to be a categorical imperative that we undertake these schemes because they were the right thing to do and it was realised that we had the means to do it .
[native] the thought that we wait until the bear threatens a highly contributing member-state like poland before we take action is absurd and gains us nothing but political ill-will , a continuing ineffectiveness on the national decision-making and military level and a reputation for weakness .
[non-native] however , on the basis of the above mentioned , i think the reasons i have provided in favor of my position are build on a solid foundation .let 's imagine and create a person who is successful in his firm who is in mid thirties .
[non-native] moreover , learning is a joint process in which facts have their own importance but they are not only important things to be learn , at some point ideas and concepts finds greater edge over the facts , hence they are more pivotal in upbringing of the society .gaining knowledge is a never ending process .
[native] the reason implicit behind the deployments is to provide a casus belli the us public would have to accept if russia invaded , as it would be american lives lost in the attack ( as opposed to one that could be dicked around about whether it was an ` actual ' attack ) .
[native] they who hoard up gold and silver and spend it not in the way of allah , unto them give tidings ( o muhammad ) of a painful doom , > on the day when it will ( all ) be heated in the fire of hell , and their foreheads and their flanks and their backs will be branded therewith ( and it will be said unto them ) : here is that which ye hoarded for yourselves .
[non-native] fore examples me and may father how you thaink enjoy in his life me or my father of cours me becuse my father fraied from my mather .i do not agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know to do well .
[non-native] there are seperate bus roads on the ground to enhance they are travelling smoothly ; there are some rebuilt of the undergroud to make it more convinence and capable to travel with ; there are even more rail service undercontruction to improve our daily transport .
[native] what 's concerning about all of this to me is the slow realisation that if we , or anyone else for that matter , were in a similar position as ukraine currently , i 'm not so sure if any of our partners in europe would be prepared or interested in coming to our aid .
[native] my reasoning is n't my personal perception , it 's that the flag is actively used by a group that is currently murdering people and spreading a message of terrorism and destruction and solely by that group ; that 's not a subjective call that 's just facts .
[native] there is now no possible outcome that does not make a brexit more likely : - either , cameron agrees to pay the full # 1.7 bn ( in which case there will be intense anger in the conservative party , potential more defections to ukip , opinion polls will show brits increasingly keen on brexit ) ; - or , cameron does not agree to pay the full amount ( and i can not see how this would even be possible at this stage ) in which case there will be some intense anger among the leaders of various other eu countries , intense anger on r/europe etc.
[non-native] you can learn about other countries customes and live for some days like a person of that country .in my opinion its better for me to specialize in one specific subject , because if i specialized in many academic subjects i 'll get distracted and i would'nt manage to pass in all of the subjects for example i wanted to study general mass communication but when i thought about it i figured that i ca n't manage to to study four subjects , so i pictured my self for future and i thought that advertsing would be very good for me if i passed my toel hopefully , and some of the people have jobs i mean part time jobs so their jobs makes studying harder for them , and am not saying that if people wants to have broad knowlege of many academic subjects is wrong , half of the people can manage and the other half ca n't , thats why people should know thier ability of understandig and wroking hard unless they should specialize in one subject , but i dont mind trying to study more than one subject and if i do handle it i will continue its very good to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , it is very usefull for future and for your future job and you will have the apportunity to work in so many fields if you did n't like a job you can move from it and go work in other job but as i said people should know thies ability if they can or if they ca n't so they could manage themselves .some people disagree with the statement most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
[native] one of the main reasons the problems are n't more widespread is that we do n't have northern africa and the middle east at our doorstep ; we have a whole ocean separating us and can pick and choose who we let into the country .
[native] and frankly , the only people i 've ever seen use `` antisemitism '' to refer to prejudice against `` semites '' are arabs or pro-palestinian folks who are specifically doing so to co-opt the word and prevent jews from using it , so you are in particularly poor company .
[native] you can keep hiding behind your couch clutching your hunting rifle in paranoia that some knacker might break into your house , i 'm going to go and sleep comfortably knowing that you people are few and far between , and , in general , not particularly well armed .
[non-native] i think people should be carefull not to spend a fortune on purchasing a product that could be wrongly be advertised for .i agree with the topic that it is important for the students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
[non-native] the fisrt group may give some reason to support their idea , because facts can be consider a logical conseguence of the ideas and the concept , and if a student understand the ideas and the concept he can learn fact easylier and quicklier .
[non-native] indeed if the price of oil carry on increasing ( it is quite sure that it will carry on increasing because oil becomes more and more rare and difficult to exploit ) and if ingeneers do not find a new technology to replace oil ( for example electricity or hydrogen ) , it would affect the budget of a family and people would prefer riding a bike or taking bus to go to their work rather than using their car .
[non-native] it is very important to know the fact that there has been the first world war , but it is necessary to understand which have been the ideas and the reasons which lead to start something highly dangerous and that would have caused thousands of victims .
[non-native] they took as support wellknown peoples like football players our basketball players , in order to prouve that the products are very wealthy , so the people who are very influencable could take this message at the first level and imagine , if they have the same foods , that they will be able to improve their own performamces and fill better in their lifes .
[native] i love that russians say it is n't fair to compare themselves to western europe because america dumped money into europe with marshall plan and then you have people in western europe that bitch like they were robbed by being given tons of money to rebuild their countries with .
[non-native] when compared to the number of students that help their community , the number of students that dont outcast them however , there is still room for improvement , every cloud has a silver lining and therefore i can say that maybe in the near future some improvement might be made , however we notice that as the years are passing we tend to see more people involved with their materialistic world leaving no or less time for the helpless .
[non-native] actually i think that this way to sell the product is wrong not only because the enterprise sell a bad thing to the public but it will lost a clients in the future , because the consumer will not buy other thing of that brand .there is no doubt that car is the mainstream of transportation in modern times .
[native] this is reflects modern english in that very few words in english come from old norse , but something like 40 % of the top 100 used words in english come from old norse , where 30 % of english comes from french ( meaning norman , referring to when the normans invaded in about 1030 - that 's the next evolution phase of the english language ) , but there are only 1 or 2 words in the top 100 most used that are of a french origin ( ` number ' is the only one i can remember off the top of my head ) .
[non-native] if news deals with politics and the role of the government or the whole political organization , the student has to understand ideas and concepts of different parties of the government for instance , in order to understand better and to be able to learn more easily the facts of the society and understand why the society react in this way .
[non-native] to sum up having a risk can improve and help people to have a success life but it should be taken with a long study and responsabilityto justify whether young people do give enough time to helping their communities or not it is important to work out the situation a young woman or man is faced with in our society .
[native] the dáil needs major reform , they behave like an entitled aristocracy and seem to forget that dáil is getting nearly all the blame for the damage done to the country over the last 10 years ( and in my opinion rightly so ) .
[non-native] thus we can conclude that a youngster can enjoy life much better with no strings attached to the family in terms of earning the livelihood as well as physical constraints and time restrictions .many succeful people hate to do the same things and they like to take risks and to try new things .
[native] if you had a good monitoring system it would ` nt of spread through-out the entire european union , in such huge quantities , and been on market-shelves for what could 've been a couple years , with seizures continuing for a whole nother year once it was found out .
[native] additionally , there are numerous factual contradictions in the new testament ( one gospel says mary was there when jesus was crucified , another says she was absent ... devout christians believe both are equally * inspired * by god - that 's a massive theological difference ) this is a big deal , because it allowed christianity to drop the desert-shepherd mumbo-jumbo ( leviticus and shariah type laws ) .
[native] but i * can * say that i think foreigners who want to come here to teach people how to be abusive pieces of shit should be declined on that basis , and i think the net good from that by far outweighs any bad that comes from censorship .
[native] perhaps in the past , scots was much more distinct ( as evident by royal letters between the two nations being conducted in french ) , and if so , i redact my whole comment , but scots spoken nowadays - i honestly would n't be able to tell between a distinct scottist english accent .
[non-native] i think that accusing young people for not helping is wrong , and that there is a need for an environment that makes young people want to participate in helping their communities .at first glance , we could easily think that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
[native] if a government makes a law that goes contrary to the agreement containing isds provisions , the courts have to judge with that new law in mind , and not what was replaced from the agreement ( the obvious exception is a place like the netherlands , where international agreements have special protections under the constitution ) .
[native] this came about quite naturally just like silicone valley , i expect because of the high concentration of capital , financial and commercial sector , the toronto stock exchange , headquarters of all of canada 's major banks and many national and international businesses , large educated population and high level of universities and overall high standard of livability .
[non-native] the first is that today there are an incredible numbers of cars in the world , in europe and in the north america the market is full , but in asia , for example , the rapidly grow up of population could have increase a numbers of cars .
[native] get your shit together germany , you innovate so much with engineering and the sciences ; but where is the innovation with your food seriously , some awesome fusion going on with your turkic-germans or whatever you call them , but you have the worst food in europe besides the english , imho .
[native] nah , it was a popular one , and it depends on context how misleading it is when you say it was a `` fascist lead coup '' , and i 'm reserving my judgement on the political nature of the maidan revolt until the elections .
[non-native] it 's a continuous increase of production to make businness move , and this is possible only with concurrential product , even if this means to show a new product that does n't differs by the previous one but that is shown to be bettert than it .when taking a trip , there are many ways to go about it but there is for all , one escential requirement that will ensure a successfull journey , and that is : to plan ahead the details of such a voyage .
[non-native] nowadays it can be seen on the young people life style they see the life not just for living in a safe and sound they want to earn much money the good skills and the comfortable conditions / and by making this life advantages they are forgetting to the importance of the being social they spent all the time to going around and for resting or samething which is not useful for the public they are getting used to living just for themselves they never thing about their responsibilities for the social life
[native] he often referred to it as an ` anachronism ' and once said it is : `` a pimple on the face of europe '' and a state that no longer had a right to exist , denouncing the swiss people as `` a misbegotten branch of our volk . ''
[native] while that seems like it makes sense at first glance , you do say that a ) there are transgender * lgbs * ( thus already making the differentiation ) and b ) there are lgbs * among * trans ( wo ) men .
[native] i recall other countries have done this in past and in current conflicts to support rebel forces , and russia/putin has shown pattern of same the same tactics knowing it 's hard for other countries to condemn with strong actions knowing they do the same .
[native] i 'm just saying , if you wan na throw shit at europe for `` undermining '' obama or not taking a harder stance , like america , maybe you should probably stop and think for a moment about how much america fucks shit up regularly .
[native] this is a real loss of liberty ( `` state-sponsored theft '' if you will ) , but imo it 's justified as a very small loss of liberty in comparison to the great gains for the general welfare that we get from having a government and public services .
[native] then an elder would start talking in a fast monotone saying people should come up and ask for forgiveness for sins and that god is telling him that there 's people `` here today '' who are crying out for redemption , so people would go up to confess and sometimes they would start going mental and thrashing around on the floor while the elders are being like `` we command you to leave her in the name of jesus '' ... it was so fucking crazy .
[native] and getting out of jury duty is very hard , work is no reason , and at least in america everyone over 18 has their name entered into a system that picks people at random to serve for either a certain case or as many trials in a day .
[native] i know we 're in eurovision this year , but it 's still over $ 2000 and 25 hours to get to sweden and back from australia , it seems a little bit wasteful to spend all that time and money to fly to europe to punch up some guy .
[native] again i am comparing pre tax income to pre tax income so that it is most fair to eu since i at least am trying to be objective instead of being an anti usa ideologue that is searching for justifications to throw around third world insults .
[native] perhaps not as comprehensively as the polls would suggest as people who are more inclined to be anti-abortion ( old and rural , basically ) are also more inclined to actually vote but the sizable urban and less-sizable-though-in-this-case-it-might-be-more-sizable-due-to-the-liberal-issue-at-hand youth vote should push it through .
[non-native] one example of risk are sports , the mayority of persons that participate in an event , such a marathon , know how to train and what it should be done to finish the race ; but only some of them win the race , and these specific individuals usually not only win one competition but a lots .
[non-native] for example when we watching tv or listening the radio or writing at the pc we use the electryc current but for produce this we fire the petroil or fire the gas or oil or we break the natural skyline of the mountain with electryc central .
[native] there 's also a strange underlying assumption that the commission should be policy and value neutral , which is not true - the values of the eu are very clearly set out in the governing treaties , and the commission has the duty to promote those values .
[non-native] the way we deal with problems and our ability to solve them , the very thought of ourselves as free living beings and the attitude we have towards our enviroment , are factors that will make the people that sorround us decide whether we are enjoying life or not .
[non-native] in conclusion , successful people try new things and take risks rather than doing what they already know how to do well is a good thing .i agree wtith this opinion that successful people try new thiungs and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
[native] i think they have a right to hope for good treatment , a warm place to sleep , with food and water and clothing like you said , safety ; any reasonably humane country i would hope would provide those things to someone who is legitimately a refugee and not just scamming the system .
[native] the house also has the power to elect the president if no presidential candidate receives a majority of votes in the electoral college , but the ec has only ever been deadlocked twice in our history * ( and the last one happened close to two hundred years ago ) * .
[native] for instance , lenin 's ideas on there being a global core and periphery ( alongside trotsky 's ideas of international development being uneven and luxembourg 's ideas of capitalism depending on pre-capitalist societies in the periphery ) have all heavily influenced the development of dependency theory - something we learn about in school .
[native] > again , in ireland you might still cling to catholicism and original sin , ireland 's doing pretty poorly with its clinging , given that catholic church attendance is below 30 % , more than half of irish people place no importance on religion , and the number of priests in the country is threatening to drop into triple figures .
[native] > while mr carney resolutely refused to give a calculation on the precise levels required , he told mps on the treasury select committee that the experience from other countries was that central banks needed to have reserves equivalent to at least 25 per cent of gross domestic product if they used another country 's currency .
[native] of course , the final agreement will be public for more than a year after it 's made which will be plenty of time for scrutiny , and the european parliament shot down acta thanks to public pressure ( something the eu negotiating team is very mindful of ) , so there 's still hope even if it does turn out to be rotten .
[non-native] in life you have to be willing to do a lot of things around you that not may always look easy but at the end the results are worthy , and you can just look back and apreciate what you 've doneadvertisments is one of the best way to interact and interfere with the audience .
[non-native] combining that with facts you will be able to create products and solutions that could be recognized in your surounding business environment .i dont agree with this statement that sais that succesful people are the ones who try new things and take risks rather than those that only do what they already know how to do well .
[native] it is also useful for europeans to utilize russia as their own boogieman , which not only helps to cement the necessity of the european union , it 's economic integration , and the concept of common security , but also maintains the united states heavily invested in the region .
[native] but instead , let me say that i find it rather unfortunate that some developers do not do the what 's from my understanding a relatively simple task of enabling applications for smartphones ... could someone with a development experience in terms of uwp shed some light on this ?
[non-native] i think the idea of traveling with a guide takes all the charm and the adventure of the trip , also the guides are use to show only the most common tings on a tour , so many small and detailed things get out of context .
[non-native] that should be the difference between us and animals maybe in twenty yeaars they can also learn how to drive a car but then it would made us same and we wouldnt want that happenwhen i first came to sri lanka , in 1993 , there were hardly any cars .
[native] but there is a world of difference between them having consultation meetings with negotiators to tell the negotiators what they hope to get out of it , compared to if they know the full details of the agreement and specifically what they should appeal to the public and the politicians ( who will be voting to ratify it ) to try and manipulate the outcome .
[native] either that or you feel very much under attack when it is pointed out that cyprus is n't in fact the leader of the world in this aspect , the uk is also pretty shit at that kind of thing at the moment , i do n't feel oppressed by the countries that suggest the uk should improve in those areas though .
[non-native] i disagree with making product look much better then what they really are , firstly is that its cheeting on pepoel from buying the product on what they think it is by looking at it for example i want to buy a table its cheap and in good shap but after i use it , it doesnt continue one day and its broken .
[native] assuming we 're talking about modern constitutional monarchies instead of the old absolute monarchies here , but if you get a good royal family with strong morals and know their place , monarchs can serve as good political unifying figures with a permanence across generations , something which is impossible with presidents .
[native] for some reason , i 'm finding it much harder than any of the others i 've done - things just wo n't * stick * - but i 've got two spanish-speaking flatmates who i 'd love to be able to ask to clean up their chipotle sauce on my toaster , so i will persist !
[non-native] i have an example that confirms what i have said now : one of my friends , mario , has a great passion for the study ( he has readed all the volumes of his encyclopedia ) , but he does n't have studied a specifical matter , because he has n't frequented the university , so he has n't a job yet .
[non-native] the education system permit them to meet many different persons , until the entrance in the professional life : the student has to change of educating place all his student life , with the school , the highshool , the college , etc . ..
[non-native] in conclusion i do n't agree with the sentence because when i wanted to buy my car a recieved a lot of information about the topic and i really think that it is imposible that the number of cars decrease in the future because everything is improving the car-market .there will be quite fewer cars in use twenty years later surely .
[native] today with neoliberal policies being the way of things , it 's like a game of smash and grab where you pay as little as you can , maximize the profits , and then run away with the wealth and leave the country with nothing .
[native] even after this ladies children have left her because of her lack of involvement with them and her husband passed away leaving everything to his french mistress , she still is lying about her age to people in a bar , trying to impress them with her family lineage .
[native] when a situation arises ( as it did during the second world war , although when independence and the six northern counties were offered in exchange for eire entering the war , de valera declined the offer ) attitudes may change , and it does n't hurt to talk about anything .
[native] > > and america took on a huge reserve of british pound sterling , which , whenever britain behaved in a non-compliant manner , it would sell on a huge scale , causing the value of the pound to drop , like happened during the suez canal crisis .
[native] i think it 's like , just as europeans never really understood how americans felt about 9/11 , europeans do n't really understand what it was like for - at least - around half of the country to see us after going steadily for over a year towards war with iraq .
[non-native] taking into account the enormous exchange of information nowadays , it is quite understandable that evolving a product is not as common as it was in the past ; most of the related products are on the same level of invention most of the time .
[native] if i sell something to a business in canada that satisfies my country 's legal definition of an apple , but it 's not considered an apple in canada , and they want to sue me , who is going to decide who is right ?
[native] on the subject of conspiracy theorists , here 's the latest post by the op here : [ what you are really objecting to is that the default trust which the supporters of these things used for so long to slip them in under the radar is gone .
[non-native] shortage of fuel and governmental restrictions will make drivers hesitate and at the same time , they will choose to take mass transportation .whether it 's better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject , it 's a complicated issue .
[native] > for reasons that have no rational explanations at this time , the us and europe have embarked on a concerted program to demonize putin , ostracize russia , and bring the world as close to a major conflict as it 's been since the cold war , a time hardly memorable to many in the current crop of our elected officials .
[native] that 's mysticism , and from what i can tell astrology is just as valid a way to predict truth as is [ ripping apart a rabbit to see how its intestines fall ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/haruspex ) , or looking at the tea leaves at the bottom of a cup .
[native] with that said , german policy needs to be two things : * 1 ) consistent * 2 ) unambiguous merkel should ** unambiguously ** denounce the aggression in ukraine , and make it clear that there will not be a return to `` business as usual '' until the russians withdraw from the border and stop supplying aid across the border .
[non-native] for example i have to study a lot of different subjects in my university because my engeniring program is very huge and for become automation engeniring i have to study subjects that are very different but the problem is that when the academic program jumps from a thing to another and when these two things are very different a student could lost his target and if an academic program wanna construct with a lot a no connected pieces it is very difficult to understand where that program bring . ..
[native] the evidence provided by the eu that hormone meat was carcinogenic in subsequent attempts to resolve the dispute was found to be contradictory with other findings ( including by european scientists ) and poorly done , and thus was determined to be insufficient for the ban .
[native] worth noting though that nato grossly overstepped their mandate with regards to this , which is a major reason as to why we have n't seen similar interventions in syria , and why we will likely not see the responsibility to protect doctrine put to use for a long time , if ever again .
[non-native] we have to stop the growth of cars to be free to make easy our movements , and also to protect us to the air pollution .knowledge has no limit , infact it depends on the person what he really wanna know or learn indetail to what it will be helpfull to him or is required for him .
[non-native] nowadays , young people concentrate on their own lives so much that they do not spend their time for their communities .i disagree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities from the following three reasons ; ( 1 ) they have enough time , ( 2 ) they have little intention to do , ( 3 ) their communities do n't expect young people to do ,
[native] the gdp/capita is extremely high , higher than canada 's , uk 's , germany 's , but the rural population represents 37 % of the population , which is fairly high ( compared to 25 % for germany , the highest of the three mentioned ) .
[native] i do n't think any of us can really imagine what the future will bring , but i suspect it will change our society a lot , i just hope its for better than worse , and right now the global trend is heading in the `` worse '' direction .
[native] > `` the nixon campaign in 1968 , and the nixon white house after that , had two enemies : the antiwar left and black people , '' former nixon domestic policy chief john ehrlichman told harper 's writer dan baum for the april cover story published tuesday .
[non-native] in this case the person has not the quality to be a successful person because he/she did n't work hard to reach his/her life 's purpose , he/she does n't konw how to work well or how to behave in some kind of circumstances and first of all ther 's the risk that the success can have a too big weight for he/she and this kind of people could crash down .
[non-native] the ideas and concepts in the world that make a change and have an effect on the facts .in the long run , understanding ideas and concepts are more important than learning facts becasue understanding main concept let students to adapt constant understanding about new facts in the long period time , and because students can approach to the factors more intuitively and effectively .
[non-native] it has been observed that since the industrial revolution , which began during the mid-eighteenth century , the span of many environmental changes ( such as the melting of the ice in the north pole ) , which was previously of several thousands of years , has been reduced to a few decades .
[non-native] yes i can , so i agree with the following statement , whatmore i feeling concerned by this because i 'm one of theses young people and i have conscience of this but how changed the new waywith regards to the statement `` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . ''
[native] russia is evil for projecting it 's own interests in the black sea , syria but yet americans have 553,321 military bases around the world , overthrow governments constantly , cause mass political strife in the middle east for oil yet they are the `` good '' guys .
[native] that said , moving your business to a country with rampant corruption comes with its own risks , so i guess it 's easier for the company to stay put and the employee take on the extra risk by immigrating and accepting crappy wages and condititions instead .
[non-native] so i conclude that younger people will enjoy the life than the older people do because of the interest shown by the older people , emerging of new cultures and using new technologies to lessen the burden , fast thinking and no tensions about the family problems .
[non-native] i choose the thing best for ofrankly , as long as we will not develop little spaceships to fly around - which i do n't see happening within the next twenty years - i do n't think there will be fewer cars on this earth ever again .
[non-native] their general knowledge will make them better leaders since they know the company as a whole and do not only see it with the eyes of one department only .i think that nowdays there few young people that spend some of their time to helping someone else .
[native] basically , she 's got a canvas on the ground and she stuffs the balls of paint up her twat - she 's naked of course , and she waddles up these two scaffolding type planks and when she gets to the top she squats down and squeezes them out ... plop ... plop ... plop .
[non-native] for example when i went to cartagena this year ( without a guide ) , i did not want to visit the same places everyone visits ; i wanted to go through the `` old city '' by myself and on foot and in the process i saw some things that can not be seen with a tour guide because they are not found in well-known places of the city ; one example of it is the contrast between some of the most luxurious restaurants of the city and the poberty just in front of the restaurant 's doors . .
[non-native] if people prepare their trip ahead of time , they can also learn the same kinds of infomation that a tour guide provides during the trip .i can answer to this statement with a sentence : it depends on the age and on the situation we are living .
[native] all the small states can do , if the statesmen of the greater states fail in their duty , is resolutely to determine that they will not become the tools of any great power and that they will resist with whatever strength they may possess every attempt to force them into a war against their will .
[native] this plane would have been shot down today , eu action or no eu action , and it 's just a tragic wrong-place-wrong-time thing , considering the rebels seemed to think they were shooting at a turboprop that ca n't fly that fast or that high .
[non-native] according to a recent survey by statistic canada , 80 % people whose ages are below 30 believe that older people should be respected and 90 % of those who are older think they are happy and appreaciative about the respect they get from young people .
[non-native] to summarize , i feel that car use is likely to decline over the coming years , both due to a recognition of the inherent problems with car proliferation and due to the emergence of viable alternatives for quick transportation and easy accessibility .i think the answer of this statement depend on the culture or the previos experience of the people .
[native] taking ireland for example , it can as long as 2 hours to get from one end of dublin city to the other ; yet it would take about the same amount of time to travel from cork ( south ireland ) to dublin .
[native] there 's nothing inherently un-hygenic about properly washed genitals on a beach or in a pool - no more so than an unwashed armpit , or creases of fat rolls , and in any case , a bathing suit or bikini does n't stop bacteria .
[non-native] therefore , car use will not become fewer at any time be it in twenty years , after twenty years or thiry years .i think that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because it is safer , the best touristic places are shown , and it can be cheaper .
[native] well , the uk somehow manages to have a deployment and intervention force as well as having a force usable against the rufed , you 'd think that germany , with 20 million more people and a lot more money might manage the same .
[native] whataboutism is fine though , if you want to retort with it , but just know , i support no one in any of these conflicts , because i 've seen enough to realize that no matter who is fighting who , it 's all a fucking waste .
[native] whenever something happens that is pretty strongly rooted in religious ideology , the guardian is always one of the first to come out with the `` it has nothing to do with islam '' articles , and `` stop criticizing the muslims '' articles .
[native] so my government , which does not have its commission nominee policy as part of the policy it was elected on , gets to nominate one member of the 28 member european commission , who will have one area of specialisation ( which is decided behind closed doors after he is nominated ) .
[native] regarding tall poppy syndrome , there was a study showing how nz puts * equality * ahead of * liberty * and * fraternity * ( liberté , égalité , fraternité is the traditional order of these ) so things like social welfare , universally available healthcare , acc , no tipping ( as we 're not servants and do n't accept money for favours ) are ingrained .
[non-native] second , almost all of the people have much curiosities about a lot of topics , so in the point that people want to study more and more , we should not bother their mind , but we had better make people who want to study many academic subjects freely .
[native] i apologise for not really giving you a good answer to your very first question but my sources are in my head and came from studying political science , starting over 10 years ago , so maybe i could search through some dusty textbooks but all it would do is prove there are people who agree with me and people who argue the other side .
[native] even once the final text document is released , most will not bother to read it , they will ask for quick summaries and those who have also not read it will give them a bullshit one and now you have two idiots on your hands .
[native] that 's why the directly democratic element of the eu always seems to lag behind its powers , because the national governments are ok with handing over powers as long as they ( jointly ) control them , but less in a rush to hand those powers over to the control of the eu parliament .
[native] at one point in the program , they have a testing group test an opel ( parent company is gm ) zafira and when they drove it with `` road like '' conditions on the machine , it actually managed to blow more nox particulate than the machine was designed to test for .
[non-native] however on the final analysis , i believe that young people enjoy life more than older people do because younger people can do whatever they want i mean that their body nature tends them to move faster , showing great energy on everything they do .
[native] target language , though ... well , esperanto by definition * should * be spoken precisely according to the rules set out in the `` unua libro '' , so that it 's standardized and not influenced by people 's native languages to the extent where it loses universal understanding .
[native] they also appear to be far far more concerned with the west than i think most westerners realise , and they appear to expect that this is reciprocated , when in fact apart from those of us who take a special in eastern europe and russian relations , most people could n't give a shit about russia .
[native] when a government puts things in a secret fta that they could not ever get by means of the ballot box , that effect millions of peoples well being and health , and then lies about it , pathologically , i have a problem with that .
[non-native] because the sucessfull wants to try a different thing to be discover even is it a risk try and try until that sucessfull work is discovered if we think it is risk we can get thing in these world for example the telephone is discoverd by the grahambell the telephone is very important in the daily life of the evary man .
[native] * paris 6 nights * bruges 3 nights * amsterdam 4 nights * rome 6 nights * florence 4 nights * riomaggiore 2 nights * ljubljana 2 nights * bled 1 night * istanbul 5 nights ( fly from zagreb ) * budapest 4 nights * prague 3 nights
[native] > ** tallinn , estonia ( cbs news/cbsdc/ap ) ** -- president barack obama proclaimed an unwavering and permanent u.s. commitment to the security of its nato allies , as he mounted a show of solidarity wednesday with european nations anxious about russia 's aggression in ukraine .
[non-native] i will end this essay by saying that a solid background of knowledge is necessary , and only then you can specialize in your own field .the humankind always need advertisement to reach good life standart therefore advertisement is a very important aspect of humanslife .
[non-native] nowadays young people do n't care about the benefits of helping their communities , on their sons and dougters , thats how it work in our days exept some young people of course they help their communities and do any thing to glade their communities and parents .
[native] every day in reading and comprehension class , we would all have to stand up and read a paragraph of something aloud , and there would be house points given for good pronounciation , or deducted on occasion for lapsing into `` a bi ' o ' bu'er '' and `` tha 's the wa'er bo ` le '' ) .
[native] also , if she bothered to read the road code like she 's supposed to , she will see that an absence of yellow lines does not mean it 's safe to pass , yellow lines mean it 's particularly not safe to pass because there may be a dip in the road , driveways , hidden intersection etc.
[non-native] at the end , most people are really unsatisfied with the product they have bought , and end up buying the one which they really needed , and not the one that is giving you lots of promotions , that at the end does not satisfies the custumer .
[non-native] alsoit is amassing the rates that you can find in the market if you travel in a group , the persons that organise this kind of trips are always finding the best rate because they sell volume so the hotels give them the best rates to fill the hotel , also they arenge transportation and is cheaper travelling in a bus that in several cars .
[native] it will take years , at best , for the industrialized world to put itself back together after such an event , especially considering the fact that most of the manufacturing centers that make this equipment will also be grappling with widespread grid failure .
[non-native] for example , if you have to study a difficult subject as macroeconomics , the most important thing is to understand what you are doing , not just studying all the models given by your text , because the concept are at the base , once you have made them yours you will be able to solve all the exercises without knowing all the models by heart .
[non-native] but my reasons and examples demonstrated that it is the better for students to understand , so they keep things better in their mind , the can solve problems better and the can be proud of their grades !i am agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather then only doing what they already know how to do well .
[native] the uk is made out as an anti-eu saboteur , but going by the lisbon treaty referendum results ; in france , the netherlands , and ireland ( round 1 ) , i think that those opposing a more federal eu need more representation , not less .
[non-native] for that reason , it 's necessary to accept the risk and to be conscious of because you will only be able to success if you are n't fear the disadvantages or the risks .i agree to the statement where i believe most adverstisements make products seem much better than they really are .
[non-native] for this reason i do n't agree with the statement because i think this kind of person will surely try new things or take some risks to reach what he/she wants to or to improve in his/her job , because he/she is sure , competent and respectable .
[native] russia should not have had a military presence , it should have been done a few months or a year later so an actual advertisement of the benefits and cons of each position could be shown and it should have been internationally checked by a third party to make sure everything was above line .
[native] it 's not a matter of `` supporting '' the independence ; say that a region of ireland wanted to break off today , i would n't want it to happen , but i would support their right to do so by popular mandate and i would n't be punitive about the issue .
[non-native] knowing that , for example , you like math , you will go to college , to study something involving math , which besides being the area you like , will encourage you to work even seriously because now , it is the only thing you must work for .
[native] outside the obvious cultural/political/religious / whatever , the literal meaning of those two terms is supposed to embody the awareness of being a part of the ` light ' , literally acknowledging that fact that we 've been * made * from sunlight and all that psychedelic jazz .
[non-native] however , if we define ` enjoyment ' as the feeling of experiencing the ` high ' of life , of taking full advantages of all the opportunities available to us today , then i believe , it is the youth which has more of an advantage .
[native] i see it in my daily life , in my family life , i see the pain it causes , i see the lack of autonomy poor people have , the lack of opportunity , a shitload of deeply seated latent racism in white culture .
[non-native] but some more money means the possibility of choosing what you want to do among a wider spectrum of things , and this is surely nice and helpful to enjoy life .i think that i will have to partially agree and partially disagree with the statement that young people tend to not give enough time helping their communities .
[non-native] to explain my answer i would quote an example of my city where no of car purchasers are getting increased and also as far as the latest data are concerned , each family in india would own car in the next twenty years and also i do not see any reason for the number of cars to comedown in the next twenty years and also as the car provides you much comfort , no people would love to loose that option .
[native] > criticism > amy chua 's other thesis and her conclusions have been disputed by george leef [ 5 ] of the john locke foundation , who proposes that many other factors may account for ethnic violence , including the most simple motivation of pure racism .
[native] http://defensetech.org/2014/07/31/chinese-radar-may-pierce-f-35-stealth-armor-report/ do not forget that it 's stealth is pretty much useless against major countries , while other countries are either buying up the chinese systems and thus the f-35 stealth is useless within that airspace , or they are countries without anti-air defences and stealth is not needed in the first place .
[native] i was merely referring to the term `` multiculturalism '' i am not some far left extremist who thinks that completely opening the floodgates in europe will have no consequences , it does , it is a messy situation that have put many people in a tough spot , migrants and europeans alike .
[native] this new court system would address the problem of implied/tacit consent , the problem that a large proportion of rapes go unreported , the problem that cases that do make it to court usually do not result in a conviction , and the issue that rape victims are often re-traumatised by a court system that encourages lawyers to attack the victim .
[non-native] you will never what is going to happen instantly but what thing for sure is wherever you get out of that risk you have to be proud , no matter if that risk worked or not , at least you trie dto do your best .
[native] thats a long game to be playing , it could result in an entire generation growing up to become anti russian , if they had have waited for the current anti-russian generation to have moved out of power and politics , they might have had an easier go of it .
[non-native] as a conclusion , i prefer to travel alone rather than with a group menber led by a tour guide in accordane with the above-mentioned points althogh someone would like to trave with a goupmenber in terms of safety purpose or easiness of the travel schedule and planning control .with the rapid development of our society , more and more people can afford travel , whether short-distance or long-distance , internal or oversea .
[native] the ukrainians did make that decision and it shocks me that europeans who a few months ago were all gung ho and practically already welcoming ukraine to the path to eu membership have turned and run for the hills when the big fucking bear decided it did n't want that to happen ( which even an 8 year old could have seen coming ) .
[native] it of course does n't work , and not only does it look suspicious as fuck to the rest of the world , it looks really fucking stupid to anyone who notices the organisation error because these cover ups did n't work in the soviet era and they do n't work in 2014 .
[native] technically in ireland it 's entirely free if you 're dependent on your parents and you and your parents collectively earn less than ~ $ 30k a year ( because then you 're entitled to have the registration fees paid and you also get a maintenance grant ) .
[native] on the contrary , evidence ( both anecdotal and statistical ) points to the exact opposite - it 's no surprise that an immigrant nation grew to become the world 's biggest superpower today while isolationist countries lie in squalor , and it 's not co-incidence that china ( a country which , for long periods in history , was vastly more developed than the west ) stagnated circa-1200s when zheng he was refused to continue his voyages , and the emperor began executing anyone who left and returned to the country .
[native] > i honestly find it odd how you can claim that you wanted a conversation yet when i 've told you , numerous times , how to have that conversation , you 've instead decided to double down on being a dick to avoid the conversation .
[native] i 've seen some of the people who are always asking for a japanese course hating on and downvoting other language courses ( especially in those language polls in the duo discussion stream ) ; and i know there 's a more organized little faction of the finnish campaigners who do the same thing .
[non-native] it is not nessesary to worry about the cost if the person is rich , however not very many people would like to speand too much money just on traveling because it is also important to spend money on souveniours or on the food .
[native] but in view of the things that ostpolitik did not do , surely the salient issue is whether over the long haul the more differentiated policy of the united states , with its readiness to use sanctions as well as economic incentives , its public support of human rights and those fighting for them , and the higher priority it placed upon the element of force in diplomacy , did not after all contribute more to what happened in 1989-90 than all the maneuvers and compromises of genscherism .
[non-native] for example paticulary when young people try to go for a long tour to some himalayas they often enjoy the time with an real aspect because they like to do more advanture game like skating , climbing the moutains which they enjoy during that period of that time and most often older people do not wish to do like that .
[native] but regardless , i know for a fact that a number of german nuclear reactors still had a fair few years of safe and economical use , and i ca n't help but feel that shutting down all of them in favour of coal was a poor choice environment-wise .
[native] no but i mean your chances of getting harassed by the police in the us are basically zero if you 're white ( or asian ) , partly because whites/asians have low crime rates and police judge people based on race , and partly because police are more likely to bother people in high-crime or dangerous areas ( where pretty much only black and central americans/some mexicans live ) .
[native] when you do n't have a name for the depression/pain/anxiety ( dysphoria ) , either you just cope with the pain because you do n't have any way to make it disappear , or you just kill yourself because you ca n't tolerate the misery .
[native] electricity , motor vehicles , antibiotics , modern medicine , vaccines , electronics , computers , the printing press , television , the concept of freedom under universal secular laws , modern physics and biology , photography , railways , motors , modern construction materials like steel and carbon fibre , polymers ... https://youtu.be/9foi342lxqe
[native] i could be spending that time making a web frontend for the database and setting up the link with the ticketing system , but no he 'd rather me sit there and twiddle my thumbs instead of being productive and creating a system that would not only provide a better service to the customers but also generate a * lot * of extra work which is badly needed at the moment .
[native] > in a series of questions on the terror threat in britain , 4 % said they sympathised with people who took part in suicide bombings ( 1 % said they completely sympathised and 3 % said they sympathised to some extent ) , and 4 % said they sympathised with people who committed terrorist actions as a form of political protest generally .
[non-native] in the feature i hope my sons understand this because helping community is one of the best thing we can do in our lives .i completely agree with the view that taking risks and trying out new things , rather than sticking to known ways , make successful people .
[non-native] because of these rasons , learning how to face the facts become a so imporatnt thing in people 's lives , if we can learn and understand facts but not just know the concepts and ideas .the travel is in a group led by atour guidethat is good thing .
[native] the targeted sanctions are hitting many of his trusted inner circle who tend to live half their lives in the west anyway , whilst the more general ones ( especially with putin 's help of imposing retaliatory sanctions ) make the general publics life more difficult .
[native] > nuclear energy is n't a solution because of the waste problem oh please , take your mind out of the tabloid rags and walt-disney era storytelling ; nuclear waste has been safely and econmically stored for decades and this process is only going to get cheaper and safer with advancements , not * less * so .
[native] [ recent contradictory coverage from ria novosti ] ( http://en.ria.ru/politics/20141101/194951444/osce-observers-inspect-polling-stations-in-donetsk-ahead-of.html ) edit - [ discussion over in / r/ukrainianconflict ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/ukrainianconflict/comments/2kziof/rebels_created_fake_osce_named_asce_to_observe/ ) edit2 - note it appears to have been led by ewald stadler , a right-wing mep from austria , and alessandro mussolino , an italian political activist associated with forza italia
[non-native] because of the unavailability of oil , the costs of petrol and diesel have gone up drastically during the past few years in india and this might even hinder the people from buying automobiles but many research and development divisions of automobile industry all over the world are concentrating on this issue and they are trying to find alternative means in order to make the cars run , like the use of cng cylinders , which has been now commertialised in new delhi and slowly is shifting towards the southern part of the country .
[non-native] you will then understand both the reason of apples falling down the three when mature and not going up in the sky , as probably newton did when he first explained this phenomena , and the reason of the moon rotating around the earth and not leaving his pattern because the equilibrium between the gravity strenght and an opposite strenght due to his speed .
[native] however , as someone with a scottish surname , born to an english ( as , in most of my recorded ancestors were born in england ) family in wales , i reckon the development of a modern and rational british identity is a sensible progression .
[non-native] for example if a doctor knows all the concepts and the ideas you have to know about medicine and human body but never works with a person or does a surgery on his own when he finally have a person in front of him waiting for a surgery he probably be nervous because he have never done a surgery before , but if the same doctor insted of all the knowledge have been in surgery rooms all the time probably when he have to do a surgery on his own he would know what to do but dont know why he is doing it because he doesnt have the ideas or concepts .
[native] that was the war -- 78 days of bombing serbia and thousands dead before slobodan milosevic finally capitulated -- when nato said : `` such a success , never again ! '' yet here we are -- with the `` responsibility to protect '' the new mantra , replacing kosovo 's `` humanitarian intervention . '' both are debatable , given the failure to intervene in the separatist russian republic of chechnya then and syria , bahrain or yemen now .
[native] a few announcements were made on her behalf shortly after the crash > berlin government spokesman georg streiter told reporters that mrs merkel considered that rapid eu sanctions against russia were necessary because moscow had shown no interest in investigating the background to the air disaster .
[native] let 's not deny that the last few years , sinse putin has decided to go a bit loopy , we 're slowly entering what seems to be a slightly less severe cold war ... did we ever truly leave it , or has it been somewhat like the korean war ?
[non-native] however , combining both of the statements would lead to a much more sensible and pragmatic way of advancing in competitive world .`` it is more important for students to understand the ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts '' .
[non-native] for example if we consider a car 's advertisement , we could notice that we do not see only the car , perhaps moving on a street , usually we would hear a very rithmic music , after we would see the car , perhaps in front of a luxury restaurant , a man in an elegant suit would come down and open the other car door to allow a beautiful , sexy , girl to join him entering the restaurant , perhaps at the end we would see the couple , inside a villa , on the border of a pool , drinking two glasses of , seemingly , champagne , naturally the car is always in front of the view .
[native] it was an old protected heritage building that 'd been there for absolutely yonks , converted to a dorm in the 1920s or something and pretty much no modifications since - i had dial-up internet in my room ( this was only a few years ago ) !
[native] on february 15 , the european union will decide whether to reinstate economic sanctions on the country -- sanctions that were imposed in 2004 over the forced disappearance of four political activists and then suspended after the october 2015 elections went off relatively peacefully .
[non-native] another perspective that i would present is that not only age old people instead people who are only a few years older are less likely to enjoy themselves since the maturity level keeps on increasing with time and what i imply by this statement is that even a five year old would enjoy more than a 20 year old person since because the five year old would enjoy to the fullest only by a mear endevour of meeting a friend whereas the same thing is not likely to attract a 20 year old .
[non-native] i agree with the importance of specialing one topic , but we have already know very detail by using internet , so i think that knowing many things is more important for living in the furure than studying one subject and show some benefits about it .
[native] yeah , comparing tens of thousands of people from mostly the same cultural heritage to over a million of people who think they have the right to demand anything by force ( as seen on the serbia-hyngary border right now ) and who have completely different value priorities ... not to mention the painful shortsighted-ness of people like juncker who think they can just tell the `` refugees '' where they should settle .
[non-native] mahatma gandhi the father of the indian nation used the most unique method of `` ahimsa '' or non violence to gain independence , nobody thought of it , using non violence against violence , was unique , he risked his life to that thought and went on to gain independence for india .
[non-native] lastly , it is important to considering that in fact , doing the same things leads you to specialization , which will make you an expert on doing something or in a specific field and probably a successful and well-known person in that particular area .
[native] japan for a time ( before they adopted neo-keynesian u.s. economic policies in the late 80s ) was in fact proof that natural resources and land are laughably worth very little relative to the economic output of the the human mind ( thus making war between nations over land/resources somehow look even dumber than it already did ) .
[non-native] for these reasons , i strongly disagree with the passage and i believe that nowadays young people devote quite a reasonable amount of time to help their communities .some people like hold the opion that learn ideas and concepts is much important than learn facts , even though teachers and parents .
[native] well white , and asian , and black is absurd , those are way too general , but there are distinct genetically identifiable jewish ethnicities that show specific mutations ( mutation does not imply `` bad '' it is simply a deviation from population average ) that are observed at substantially higher rates than the population average .
[native] ** in fact , a number of those cases were stopped from spiraling completely out of control * ( as a fuckton of examples in history attest to ) * because you had representatives you elected to negotiate & compromise for you instead of just throwing two emotional mobs against each other .
[native] [ this is how i get my butter ] ( http://www.gaylea.com/images/single_packshots-assets/s_salted-butter.png ) [ this is how i get my milk ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ftj8a0uuxvk/maxresdefault.jpg ) [ this is how i get my cheese ] ( http://www.bothwellcheese.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/product-maple-smoke.jpg ) [ this is how i get my maple syrup ] ( https://cdn3.volusion.com/ysaxx.exycl/v/vspfiles/photos/124026-2.jpg ) [ this is how i get my bacon ] ( http://meatventures.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/lg_img_0909.jpg ) i look forward to seeing the various differences from around europe tbh
[non-native] on one hand facts can change or can be altered by the time or by new discoverings they are the material part of the world , on the other hand ideas are the spiritual part of our world , the part which will live forever .
[native] i 'm not sure there 's even any coherent thoughts about how the eu might change - obviously if the euro was better tailored to irish conditions , we 'd be happier , but i think there 's an appreciation of the fact that it was to a large extent up to us to trim our sails to suit the euro-wind , and what we actually did was put on all sail and head for the rocks at full tilt .
[non-native] we ca n't be sure about anything regarding what 's advertised about commercial products , but it 's important to keep our eyes open and try to choose the one we think is the best , maybe helping with our buying power those products that claim themselves to be natural and that do n't do too much advertising .success means momentum in the right place , conscidence and not a specific way to make .
[non-native] therefore , what the modern world needs is academics who are trained in different fields and academics who can put together information from different fields into meaningful wholes .i agree , all students have to understand ideas and concetps , because it is one way to learn about a topic , and it is easier for them to focus and memorize .
[non-native] at the end , i am agree with statement which said that the number of cars will reduce in the next twenty than todayslet us imagine that you own a restaurent and you work so hard in order to get your restaurent succeeded and famous in a certain region .
[native] you 're justifying russian imperialism against * ukraine * because * america * invaded one country that was harbouring terrorists and another that had a long history of conflict with america that also mass murdered his own people and was committing genocide against the kurds .
[non-native] if many people are trying to have a higher level for salary and the population number will growing i think we will have more cars than the number of people and the name for the next age will be `` car-person age '' .i am totally agree .
[native] an amphibious invasion of germany would have failed early in the war without the large fleets of specialised landing craft , years of planning , american reinforcements and complex deceptions based on the allied decryption of the enigma machine that allowed d-day to be won .
[non-native] for example furniture , the advertisement shows the same product in a perfect enviornment it tempts you immediately to replace your existing furniture but when you actually personally feel the wood its chipped or its not as desirable as it looks are not that rich as advertised .
[native] > according to a report produced by the association of human rights and solidarity for oppressed peoples ( mazlum-der ) , more than 2.5 million people have fled syria since the start of violence in the country in 2011 , and about 80 percent of the refugees are women and children .
[non-native] first of all , i think why the young people nowadays do n't like spending time with their communities , because in the morden day as we are now , there are lots of interesting things and places that young people prefered to take .
[non-native] in conclusion , i definitely prefer that specializing in one specific subject because it intensifies people 's exciting studying environments and future occupation needs professional knowledges in one specific subject .through a human life , a person usually finds a chance to develop himself about one or more topic in his academic life .
[native] the tufts study is known as being an awful study , for the key reason that it does n't even take the main variable ( non tariff barriers ) into consideration , and furthermore uses a model that is completely unsuited to trade agreements .
[native] in which case , under spanish law ( thanks to them ratifying the un refugee convention ) , they are not illegal , but are rather asylum seekers who have to be protected by the government until their claims are processed - which since they destroyed their documentation , is very expensive and difficult to do .
[non-native] if we would like to have a various kinds of life , it is better to have broad knowldege of many academic subjects .someone says that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities , well , i agree with this statement .
[native] > the problem is that let 's say 51 % vote for independence and a few months later 2 % change their mind ( very likely as independence often brings years of economical hardships ) and want to go back to the uk again , what then ?
[non-native] first , let 's think about one situation , there were one univ-educateted student and he would work at a conpany , then if he learned many subjects , i think that he could get many types of works and he could show his all abilities .
[non-native] finially , i can say that if this person did not try new things to do , i thing he has still remained as a simple farmer .i agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
[non-native] to receive the best instruction , it is necessary to undersand ideas and learn facts as well , if not the education will not be complete .some people think the successful people always try the new things and take risks , whereas other people think the successful people usually do what they already know how to do well .
[non-native] so when you have a wild culture , ( that means when you have studied many subjects at school , such as biology , physics , or geography ) , you tend to have a more critical mind , and a better approach of the situations .
[non-native] and if we think in a different way , like busses or trains , then i preffer using my own car to move rather than to use train or bus , especially in short movements , and because of beautiful things that are exist in cars those days , in which you can feel you are at home .
[non-native] even though the numbers of car utilizers are far more than people who oppose to use cars , the government and environmentalist are providing more efficient substitute of cars so that many people are convinced by the new substitute .transportation is a very crucial dimension of globalization of which we are experiencing in its highest speed .
[non-native] another psychological drive is the joy of driving cars , i do not think driving a car is a fag which passes away after some time as a conclusion the number of cars in use will be increasing untill at least thirty or forty years .
[non-native] consequently taking risk is necessary in todays world more quality requires some risks but may be sometimes this risks results can be hurt us but all of us known this no pain no gain .the world is turning to be a more demanding place , especially when refering to the work enviroment .
[non-native] however , with a more general preparation you can succed in finding a job , it could be a boring job , linked with a part of your studies that you did n't enjoy so much , and you will be unhappy for the rest of your life , becouse all the companies seek specialized people , and you have just a general knowledge of some subjects .
[native] no , the * logical * conclusion is to put every muslim under ( increased ) surveillance , break up parallel communities , stop knuckling under with all this halal nonsense , irregular uniforms ( that goes to sikhs and everyone else as well , obviously ) .
[native] yes , of course the only people who had nukes at the immediate end of ww2 were the americans , that was part of my point , to combat soviet conventional forces they 'd have been required to use every nuke they could produce in as short an order as they could produce them , hence the war turning into a nuclear one .
[non-native] if there is not a tour guide , to put an agreement into this , to settle this cause we do not share the same ideas , some people could think that is possible to talk as loud as they want , but other people do not .
[non-native] in second place , each fase of the life has its own time , if young people could understand what is really important in life they could work to achieve those goals , like to study to get a good job that allow them to rear a family , instead of only trying to pass the life as if it where a big and eternal party , and when the get older they realize that have lost his opportunities to be really happy .
[native] member states spending at 2 % or above ( as of 2012 ) : greece ( 2.1 % ) , france ( 2.3 % ) , turkey ( 2.3 % ) , uk ( 2.5 % ) , usa ( 4.8 % ) i keep seeing this sentiment throughout the thread of distancing europe from the us , leaving nato , `` standing on our own feet '' , etc.
[non-native] but in the other hand , we may add that considerations about environment protection are taking more and more importance , the sustainable development is a recurrent term in speeches and official documents , more especially , of course , in developed countries , which had already known the excitment of car technology and had also already benefit from its advantages .
[native] but just as australia has to admit it has a huge problem with how the public treats indigenous australians and try and come up with a way to reconcile the past and present , so too do scandinavians need to realise that the way their society functions is n't fantastically conducive to immigrants , and the ` simple ' options - ` exterminate the aborigines ' , or ` deport all the immigrants ' as for the ` gypsies ' , yes , there are criminal gangs that run around , commit crime , and try and abuse the fuck out of the system which comprise of ` gypsies ' .
[non-native] in conclussion , i believe that even though adults may live a duller life that is not filled with the short-term fun nor the sudden surprises young people experience , adults are perfectly capable of enjoying their life just as much as any adolescent or child .

[native] he was living in new york city when the war broke out , making a new life a long way from that old town and he did n't join up as soon as war broke out in europe , but when america entered the war he decided to travel to canada to fight for the empire rather than his new homeland .
[native] [ ** fitch warns that europe could be facing a ` doom loop ' ** ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com.au/fitch-warns-of-europe-doom-loop-2014-9 ) > if you were n't already convinced about what a nightmare deflation would be for the eurozone , credit ratings agency fitch has a grim report out , showing the sort of issues the struggling bloc could be hit by .
[native] i think i 'd be ok with it , if non contributing neutral countries that are in eu still had some power either to individually or collectively or part there of to veto it 's use , i 'm sure `` leader '' would not be a term anyone would use with it , but being honest , france , italy , germany and england would be the largest contributors and likely poland too , i 'm sure as with most things the more people ( or a country ) contributes the more say they will have in it , regardless of any democracy or power structure put in place .
[non-native] as students are supposed to study the matters they are faced to , it is more important for them to `` understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . ''i completly agree with this statement because in all advertisement the product they show is the best of all , they show the product as if it is the 8 wonder of the world , but when you go to buy the product because you are completly facinated about it you notice that is n't even the half of what they said .
[native] inequality might be a very worthwhile goal , but having inequality where 25 % of the population ( keeping in mind how large and diverse the eu is ) are 60 % bellow the average is n't that surprising and is almost worth being proud of .
[native] and as if by magic , here 's a comment from the [ bbc have your say section about this story ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-29910497?postid=120722321#comment_120722321 ) : > blatant pro eu propaganda > ideal story for the pro immigration bbc , no wonder they jumped on it and gave it headline space > the lack of facts , presented or available make this nothing more than political spin
[native] > whereas brown was shot twice in the head and four times in the arm while on the ground surrendering i 'm not saying the shooting was justified -- i have no idea yet , i do n't think enough evidence is out there -- but * come on * .
[non-native] changing the habits , keeping the motivation , developing new skills , developing other interests , discovering new sector of activity , earn more and more money , this is the challenges of the succesfull people who never want to stop their ascention . ..i agree with the statement .
[non-native] thus i would like to conclude my essay by saying that you have to think out of the box to be successful , normal and conventional everybody thinks and does , but what clicks is a unique idea , what sells is a unique idea and for that you have to think and do apart from the league and the people who do that are heroes or weave success stories .i agree that time for the community and help towards the community is not observed much these days by the younger generation .
[non-native] and also as the children of the great scholars buissiness men muscians u will daily accostemed to the atmosphere and this also encourages to go in to the studies and succed in that field this is slso one way their involves less risk and less mental stress and u will be successfull in life in 80 of 100 cases as they clerly watch and do the same thng the previous knowledge will help rather than trying different things .
[non-native] in short , these are three main points of supporting my idea that exaggerated facts , desire of audience to advertisements , and the result of best seller in mar`` { successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well } ''
[non-native] in conclusion , young people enjoy life more than older people mainly due to the fact that older people have already had their time of real enjoyement in their lives and their nature is to slowly fade due to the fact that their life goes at an end .
[non-native] with successive generations , they get farther and farther from their native culture and community and at the same time they do not feel one with the new community they become a part of and because of this reason they are not able to contribute fully to the new community also .
[non-native] old people in the past like the same things , but now after twenty years they are tired and now they like the relax things , like fishing , sleeping , reading , playing cards and they enjoy themselves also more than younger people .
[native] even more so if you say something like `` for most gun-owning czechs , a firearms is just a tool , not some form of freedom of expression , not something to collect , and not something to boast about or play with '' .
[non-native] as we are all aware of the increasing euro iii & euro iv norms , time is not far when the need to reduce the vehicles and hence the emission becomes inevitable specially in cities like new delhi where the pollution has already reached alarming values .
[native] before coming to the internet , i thought that russians were normal people like everyone else , but now i see that the average russian is a complete and utter moron that 's been brainwashed since youth to believe anything his government tells him and to deny any facts .
[non-native] all of the above supports my opinion on agreeing with the statement that most advertisements do make products seem much better than they actually are , as they do not give the consumer a clear idea of what the product is really like .i do n't agree the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
[non-native] he should attend the seminar because he is the coordinator of the project if not it results a huge loss for the company though he has to attend his father 's 9th day function he gave priority to his job and left to newzealand making all his community especially his family very sorrowful .
[native] i find the eu quite interesting , as it currently runs many parrellels to pre federation and early federation australia , imo actually has more powers and and plays a larger role than the initial australian federation did - which was largely developed to deal with issues such as a common military , increased economic cooperation , a common immigration policy .
[native] unfortunately , by the time we managed to do that , maliki had already entrenched himself in power thanks to years of sectarian strife , and given that the referendum deciding the american occupation 's future happened so soon after patreus had managed to really begin to get a grip on the situation , our image was still hurt badly & it put us in a position where the only way we could stay was if we aquised to allowing our troops to be tried by iraqi courts ... which no american president would 've ever agreed too ... ** edit : ** although probably the greatest mark against american foreign policy in this matter is the fact we went into iraq over a bullshit wmd excuse instead of just saying we 're going in to topple a genocidal dictator .
[non-native] another reason for decrease might be that maitaining a car might become too expensive , as the number of cars increased the consumption of fuel increased too , this led to decrease in the availability of fuel or over all depletion of the fuel in the world , this will lead to increase in available fuel cost .
[non-native] putting a goal in your life will lead you to the best , and whatever right you do , you will have confidence in your self , and what you do now will reflect the life of your family ( kids and wife ) , as my father always say : the more you do , the more you get .
[non-native] while it is true that the young people of today have different priorities and expectations from themselves which often leads to a self absorbed style of living , it would be unfair to say that they are any less sensitive to the needs of their communities than they were in the last few generations .
[native] because this subreddit is not constantly barraged with propaganda about the us , the subreddit is not full of delusional serbians constantly seeing obamabots everywhere , and mentioning any modicum of respect for their leader will not get you down voted by the eager ` activists ' .
[non-native] for example , a young person could have the time to spend one month in italy on vacations , meet a lot of women and have a lot of fun but he would live with a limit budget , perhaps working to eat and party .
[non-native] especially this information from my mother made me believe that most of the products seem better in the advertisement than they really are .although it 's important to learn ideas and concepts in textbooks , i disagree the statements that it 's more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because the ideas and concepts are origined from facts .
[native] all else i know , is that `` egalitarianism '' ( whatever that truly means ) gave us secular liberal democracies , gave us all the same rights under the law , gave us the same basic * human * rights almost all over the world , and as far as i am concerned before egalitarianism , life for most people was exceptionally shit .
[non-native] above all , i disagree that young people nowadays do not give enough time helping their communities .considering the statement `` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' , i feel that the statement would be much better changing it to the past .
[non-native] if we were not risk takers we would stay in the south with less cahnces for better life style for us and our children .well , i agree with the following statement that successful people always would want to try new things taking all the risks involved in doing so .
[non-native] when you chose a new thing which nobody else had tried , this is the challenger and this will cause the risk .in my life i see a lot of time that products in television are better than in reality , and sometimes i buy products that in their advertisement are prettier than really are , for this two reasons i agree with this statement .
[native] this is useful , worth saving and keeping in order to understand these fta schedules . . http://www.normangirvan.info/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/kelsey-1-how-to-read-a-schedule1.pdf bear in mind , its both old , and its about another fta . . however , its an fta gats , which ttip explicitly refers to .
[non-native] its very comon on the food industry where constantly we see in tv comecials , and posters on the steet , that some restaurant show they products bigger than they really are , also we can see a pair of tennis shoes that can give you the ability of jump higher that any pair of shoes in the market , and when you finally wear the shoes you see you just make the same performance .
[non-native] it is the best for people who lack the language which is used during the travel is to travel wih a group led by a tour guide , in that way that tour guide would be more helpful to minimize the missunderstanding and the language gap between the tourests and the locals .
[non-native] if the community is shown as as a quiet peaceful community then the urge to benefit ones self will become less , for other people can be benefiting you .the purpose of advertisement is to sell a product ; the product will be promoted to allure the customer into purchasing it .
[non-native] the freedom of mobility , safety and affordability would increase the number of cars on the roads in next twenty years .it is a common thinking that in few years there will be fewer cars in use then there are today ; it is not known if it will happen in twenty years or in a longer time but i definetely think that it will happen .
[native] the situation in eastern ukraine may seem to many like a clash between the ukrainian people and the russian people , but the russian people have no desire to wipe out the ukrainians and in fact tend to see them as their brothers -- they 've convinced themselves that they are simply fighting against fascist elements from the west , not ukraine .
[native] i still ca n't believe there are people in civilized world who think pirating is ok except for the very few rare cases when there 's just no other way ( game you bought does n't work but pirated version does , game is n't sold anymore , game is banned in your country , testing whether the game runs on your rig ... )
[native] fact is their mind is set in stone , they went full shitface mode and did n't turn back , as if they are defending lgbt people , but it 's just some social justice shit where you attempt to look down upon anyone with a different view .
[non-native] the most important reason in my opinion is that they carry less responsibilities than younger people do , for example , younger people still have to graduate from college or university , get narried , have kids and find a steady job to afford thier families and so on .
[non-native] in addition its really very hard to any citizen to wait for government mass transoptation , who is in an emergency , or planning to go for picnic with his family members or so and would be perfering to have his own car than rely on any others .
[non-native] i like to take chanses , i like to enjoy every moment of being alive even if that ment to take risks every once and while because being successfl is a gift from god which he chose me to have it so it 's my jop to enjoy it as much as i could as a thanking to my god .
[non-native] they get sufficient to go to clubs or entertainment centers to pass their time which is not possible for youngsters .with the advancement of the technology in the communication sector , the companies are now able to market their products to an anormous number of people in a really beautiful way .
[native] ever since 1964 , when denmark completely broke with almost a century of defensive neutrality by joining the british lead un forces in cyprus , denmark has been very active on the international stage providing troops for nearly all major nato and un missions .
[non-native] young people need to mouve and care for their community , because without a community , human is nothing .i would like to discuss the statement that young people do not spend enough time to help and suopport the community they are living in .
[native] '' * its a huge facility , and the contamination inside of a single room in a large cave where a large number of waste containers are stored is still quite significant when we realize that there is no way of knowing if the same set of circumstances will in the future lead to more failures of more containers in more rooms .
[non-native] example , when i was in germany exactly at munich bavarian city i was going with agroup to turn at all places , at morning we stay at one place together with all of the group untill the tour guide comes , we have a contract with a bus company to go any place in munich , so that day we had gone to aplace called garmish international park , it is located at twenty miles from munich city at the center of huge mountains .
[non-native] and he could to reach his goal to have a computer in every house in the world , beacuse of it is great programms , like the internet explorer that make the conection between all the people in the world very easy and make them feeling that the world is a small village .there is a diversity of opinions over the issue of whether most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

[non-native] therefore , the countries like china , india , the countries of africa or other countries which are not ndustrialized or are not in the free market system newly possesing that culture of usage if cars , which simply measn that there will be more cars in use in the near future .
[non-native] i think that is important for all poele not only for students to understand the information than it is for to learn facts , in fact in every situations , for example at school or also in the job , it is better understand very well before to do samethings .
[non-native] for example , young people would feel overwhelmed with anxiety or stress when first falling in love , when getting married , when expecting a baby , all of which are new to them , so that they are not sure whether they can handle .
[native] had russia not invaded and had simply used diplomacy and stated ; `` hey , look , our ethnic russians do not feel safe in your country , have referendums in these provinces to decide if they want to leave , if they decide not to leave then we will respect that but we will absolutely intervene if there is violence in the region '' however , putin is n't stupid , he does n't go down the path of diplomacy because nobody wants to god damn join russia of their own free will .
[non-native] right from a common daily-need item like a toothpaste , to a something more in vogue like a new designer brand apparel , or of technical importance like a new tv , a automobile , or a computer-all need the media to make them appealing , or to lure people to buy them-irrespective of whether or not people need them .
[non-native] however , if you go with a tour guide , this person will make your life a lot of easier , because he or she already knows where to go , at what time , what are the important parts where a tourist should focus his attention .
[native] i 'm not saying democracy is evil , but treating a democratic constitution like a religious scripture has its consequences ( in my opinion i think democracy should be used to veto policies , giving the uneducated the power to prevent politicians from exploiting them , instead of selecting politicians who mislead them into exploiting them ) .
[non-native] i will always remember my grandfather , anxious to show his experiences and colorful life to his nieces and nephews while continuing to live his live to the fullest .i do agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
[native] well i 'm aware not every crime is reported by the news ( because then they would be doing nothing else ) , but if everything in this piece turns out to be completely true , it would make me fully expect anne marie waters to be the next pm : /
[native] if he lives in the right area in the country he might have seen them around , but that would be about it , and it 's because he does n't know them he has a prejudiced predisposition that comes from a point of ignorance and therefore can not have an informed stance on the subject as the ideology of religion in practice and the people who follow it are deeply intertwined as well as being mixed with politics .
[non-native] from my experience i think it is best to either try the product , so you know if you want to buy it again or not , or ask someone who has already tried it for advice .alone , the best way to travel it
[non-native] people , irrespective of age or financial status should spend some time having fun and enjoying life than spending most of their lives dedicated to work .the statement that `` most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are '' is a quite provocative statement .
[non-native] also , it is important to be aware that having a car , is one of the most tipical of symbols of wealth and social success , and for the people of these contries , to become a car owner will be surelly prioritary .
[non-native] as a consequence , it would not let the person to stay behind the era that he lives .i totally agree with the statement that ` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . '
[non-native] students will then be capable of directing those subsystems and managing them so as to get the desired results and be successful .there is an argument regarding whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
[non-native] its easy for one to just follow the routine of his life , like what he learned in the school , from his house , from this professional and keep following it to lead a normal life with out attempting to try something new .
[non-native] in conclusion , for the reasons mentioned above , i firmly believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .each day , numerous new products are welcomed by the market and the need to promote a specific item among these huge inflation of consumption attractions stimulated advertisement sector to be one of the most fast growing sector of the econopmic system .
[non-native] in conclusion , i think that with developement of new technology , it will allievate the pressure on trasportation , however , cars will continue to increase becasue of the spout of population , increase in wealth and the seperation between working area and living areathe issue at hand is whether in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use as compared to today .
[native] however , given the ratio of negative to positive experiences i have had interacting with people who profess to be muslims , i have a rather negative view of the islamic faith and the values it seems to install in its believers and thus am wary when i meet someone new who is muslim and am also wary about a large influx of more muslims .
[native] it looks a little better ( subjective , i guess ) and is more `` powerful '' than ue4 , it 's easier to work with than idtech ( i 'm assuming the developer experience has n't improved notably since idt5 ) and uh ...
[non-native] at beging of the statment , i think one of important reason that people can make successful because successful people have already to do this thing as they make successful , they use more time than other people , they contiune their work all day , not give it up , so they successful .
[native] and that `` the euro is irreversible '' is a political statement is precisely the point about it - but the writer is evidently of that anglo-saxon persuasion that believes in the inexorable force of the market , against which no mere politics can pit itself successfully .
[non-native] one day the young peple will be old ones and so they should enjoy now and relax in the future .through today 's environment situation , i really hope that there are fewer and fewer cars used in twenty years , because the cars do pollute the air , but i think it may wo n't be true , there will be more cars in use in 20 years .
[native] this happened over and over again as i sat there eating my meal ; i think i counted 3 or 4 german vehicles doing this , as one would leave another would come and park in the trucks spot and act like a brat when the truckers try and tell them to move their cars .
[native] it was n't until i experienced poverty first hand ( in jobs , and when i had some hard times myself ) that i began to see that the world is n't just naturally easy to get ahead in and changed my ideas accordingly .
[non-native] many people surround me are worrying about their jobs , some because they ca n't find a job , some worries about how far they can go in their career , for those who want to be more excellent than others , who are looking forward to be successful people , wo n't only try to do better than others in the same thing , because as people always say ` what you can do , others can do ' , take bill gates for example , when he was determind to found a software company he was only an college student , bravely , he did n't scared by the risk but went out from the college to the true world to discover new things , to chase new goals , at the time he had a friend who ahd the same major as bill did , rejected the invetion of bill gates to found a new company together , may be he thought it is more unrisky to continue his study , or maybe he still thinks so now , but after years , bill gates becomes , we can say a legent of success , every body admire him , and seeking for ways to be as successful as him , and his classmate at college i 've mentioned before , is now a college proffessor , i 'm not saying that being a proffesor is not successful , it is also a marvolous job , but in most people 's opinion , being best one in the world , is cooler , and a people like bill gates , is the most successful one .
[non-native] where on one hand the latter could destoy the civilization , the former would develop the whole civilzation and would make this whole world a much better place to live in .i agree with the statement , i think that young people enjoy more the life that older people do .
[non-native] to say something more , if in 20 years , there are cars just like i mentioned in the article which can drive both in the air and the water , i will book one .when i talk to older people , for example to my grandparents , they give me the advise to always enjoy every hour of my life as this time will never be given back to me .
[non-native] so taking the above examples and facts one could easily conclude that for the betterment of society one has to undergo specialization which itself leads to the betterment for himself .young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities , i disagree with this statement for the following reasons :
[native] i guess it could be argued that croatia also has some indirect control over germany via the eu , but this is much less than the amount germany has over croatia , and rightfully so , based on their populations and relative influence in the eu .
[native] if you do get a $ 400 fine , you can let it go to the courts by not paying it which will cost an extra $ 30 iirc , then you can pay it off over time for as little as $ 5/week .
[native] ended up being a slightly reclusive goth kid until my late teens , yeah i was that weird kid haha ... but it was a means for self expression , no other way a guy can wear jewelery and nail polish and get away with it !
[non-native] so , my dear young people nowadays how do n't care about helping people and helping your communities , help them and you will win the happenies and you have the time to do it every young human have that time to their communities and their countries .
[native] the message needs to be pronounced enough that it reaches a leader who has built his regime upon a playground-esque image of alpha maleness , and severe enough that it causes him to abandon or at the least rethink his policies that are based upon this stance .
[non-native] and as i said , everything is based in the way you think , and in the way you comfront each of your problems that life brings you , and if you open your mind to new possibilities you will have a lot of success in your life .i disagree with this statement .
[non-native] specializing in one specific subject is excellent to solve problems related to an specific topic or activitie , because you need full data research and experience , however , many times it is helpful to consider a completly different topic or mechanism , for example to solve environmental problems in textil industry have been used many principles of tannery processes .
[native] the reality is that there will continue to be many reuropeans ( like you ) working in the uk after a brexit ( as our economy needs them and they need the jobs we offer ) and there will also be brits working in reu .
[native] gallics , venetians , ligurians , tuscans , meridionals , neapolitans , sicilians , sardinians , and plethora of minority groups avidly merged their customs into one collective culture ; italian culture , which had not previously existed , not even through garibaldi , cavour or whoever .
[non-native] in conclusion , i would say that learning facts it 's obviously important , i ca n't know history , for example , without knowing what happened , but i have to understand why it happened , which means , to give more importance to ideas and concepts than just to facts .
[native] china as a nation has existed for thousands of years ( though not without changing boundaries and changing rulers/dynastys ) many other european countries have existed with their borders and peoples largely unchanged for hundreds of years - sweden , france , denmark , portugal , spain etc.
[native] those 3dr drones are like 8 grand usd and the dji line are well over $ 1000 usd for the cheapest so i would hope if you are laying out that kind of cash for a drone it would have the ability to gracefully `` drop '' and land .
[non-native] although advertisements of products can provide people with information that may helpful to decide to buy them , they are often to lure customers with wrong images .first of all , knowledge is something you have in your brain for almost all your life if not all your life from the moment it 's acquired that 's going to make you useful to the society , business world , etc .
[non-native] in conclusion , i do n't really agrre to the topic statement because i would n't be able to chose between broad knowledge of many academic subjects and specialized knowledge : i would spend more time studying , so that i could have both .i do not agree with the statement .
[non-native] but on day before his performance he called the management and said he want more money to perform as our rival college was willing to pay him large sum of money so our college management told us that they could not afford that much money to bring that actor to perform .
[native] there 's plenty of evidence ( from research , not from the mouths of politicians ) that shows that yes , there is a small negative effect on wages * of the very low paid * but none or even positive on everyone else , and that those effects range from very small to negligible when taking into account other factors like general market shifts and minimum wage .
[native] our tax service was made business-friendly , everything was simplified , rates came down sharply , and , importantly , there was a series of tax amnesties where people could come clean and pay the taxes they 'd been avoiding without any penalties or fines .
[native] however i 'm cognizant of the fact that a policy covering half a billion people and around 60 billion euros is never going to be perfect and is going to be in a state of perpetual reform , as per the farm bill in the us .
[native] there were numerous referenda about lots of important things ( like judges pay , special i-cant-believe-this-isnt-a-court , rights of children etc ) , where as the consitutional convention was stuck with teeny issues like `` should the presidental term be 5 years instead of 7 ? ''
[native] as to the rest , what i said was that people were * happy with the outcome * after the fact , not that it was definitively a good agreement as evidenced by > most observers at the time welcomed the policies agreed to at bonn
[native] get to a point where the decisions of one state are n't bringing down all of the other states , and where companies ca n't get massive trade bonuses in one country because they 've got their head office in a country that has different corporate laws .
[non-native] in my book , well-educated people need to have a very high level of acquaintance of a certain field ( law , science , literature , etc. ) , but at the same time , it is very satisfactory to devote some time to different activities ( cultural activities , sports , and so forth and so on ) .it is commonplace to criticize our educational system .
[non-native] some people like to travel always with a group along with a guide because it is much more comfortable in a situation where you dont know the territory , the speaking leanguage is not the same as yours , when you dont want to drive , when you are traveling alone , when you dont feel like having the responsability of having to make a lot of choices and just want to follow the herd or simply because you found a really pricy deal that just ca n't be beat .
[native] it was really nice to lie in the hot pools , then come out and get covered up with mud , and let it dry in the sun . . really pulls the bad things out of your body . . its really a healing kind of thing .
[non-native] there are so many things to try , i would like to do and take risks to get success .in my point of view as a social worker , i disagree that it is better that people should learn and study as much and broad knowledge as they can .
[native] to quote randall munroe : `` defending a position by citing free speech is sort of the ultimate concession ; you 're saying that the most compelling thing you can say for your position is that it 's not literally illegal to express '' .
[native] it was considered flop for two to four reasons : it was buggy as hell at launch , textures look pretty low-res and had ( sometimes still have ) streaming issues ( very visible pop-in ) , the marketing was rubbish , and people kept comparing it to fallout or borderlands .
[non-native] in the end i would reccomend that every man who want tobe successful in life should think differently and do thing differents but only and only for improving a man kind and its nature only than a one will be remember you a greatt successfull person .the world is having the things that is more enjoyable .
[non-native] so they are not able to enjoy life as much as young people can .i agree with the statment , advertisments make the products seem way much better thay they really are , acctually many times one feals cheated , as you realice the real characteristics of a product you just bought .
[native] he put up a little looping animation on the screen behind him of two excited molecules that looked for all the world like two excited labradors ... rutting ... enthusiastically , eternally ... that was awkward enough , for everyone , but nothing compared to when i tore my eyes away and accidentally made eye-contact with the loner guy a few seats down from me ... who had moved his folder to his lap , one hand moving under the folder , and his attention on the excited molecules on the screen .
[non-native] thus working hard in early time gives fruitful results that makes people enjoy ther later life period .life is a rollercoaster ride experience , which has its ups and downs , its high peaks and slow curves or falls , which means that each stage of this ride carries with it valuable experiences , each which we have to live at a specific time and period .
[non-native] having only the broad information is not enough for future tech .younger people try to enjoy each and every moment of their life to the full of their capabilities because this is the only time in which there mind is devoid of all sorts of worries and tensions which they have to face in future to acheive their destined goal .
[native] and ultimately , one of the reasons that sociology sometimes focuses on small sizes and even individual case studies is that ( 1 ) humans are incredibly diverse and while large studies with general trends with strong statistical significance are an important part of the social sciences , they also lose information about individual behaviour and ( 2 ) that humans interact at the small scale .
[non-native] from my point of view , the advertisements tend to distort the true image of their products in order to make them look better on the market compared to the other products because of their biased nature but do not necessarily do this .the field of mechanical engineering has improved in several ways which is being reflected in the new generation cars .
[non-native] to sum up , take into all factors i outlined above , we can draw the conclusion that even though there are some uncomfortable things if we travel in a group led by a tour guide , we can get a lot from the trip under the led by tour guide .
[non-native] also , the statement is partly true to a certain extent in putting forward that young people these days do not involve in service because of the reasons put forward above .given the choice between agree or disagree about the success people trying new things rather than keeping old methods without changing , which one do i choose ?
[native] it was just as easy for them to present the fascists in chile in 1973 as a small fringe force or just a misrepresented group who are really looking for western liberalism and they would repeat those events in a heartbeat given the chance and i fear many here do n't realize this .
[non-native] when i was doing a project i used to sit wit my project team consisting about 10 members where each one gives there own ideas which come to their mind , when i was in the team i should understand the idea given by the person so that i could implement the idea to get the good result .
[non-native] i also agree that only a few students can understand the subject through ideas and concepts which are given in the textbook and the other case of students finds a different source to study that is muging up the ideas and concepts and present them in the final paper .
[non-native] in terms of balancing , how about taking the risk of opening a business of something i know how to do well or at least feel passion about ?well according to me , for students , understanding ideas and viewpoints is a pre-requisite for any further studying .
[non-native] even if we go to a gas station there is a discount , for clothes , for medicines ,,,,, for every thing there is some bonus ( so called ) to the customers , which is just , in my opinion is , another startegy to improve their business and get profits .
[native] we 'll just agree to disagree , otherwise we will be posting articles , you 're gon na dismiss mine , i 'm gon na say that yours are not right in everything , and we 'll be going in circles in no time .
[non-native] to conclude i really agree witj this statement because i think advertisements sell dreams and it is not often the reality , that is why products seem much better then they really are .i completely disagree with the fact that automobiles , especially cars , are going to degrade in number in the next couple of decades .
[native] while we 've managed to kill big time corruption with this government , an attitude of excessive discretionary expenditure by politicians using tax payer money still exists , hundreds of thousands have been claimed on extortionate holidays , alcohol , transport , hotels , the works .
[non-native] concluding , i think that the main reason towards this shift is the growing influence of technology and the fast-paced world which is turning peopalthough students are very different from each other - so what is true and valid for one may not be true and valid for an another - i generally agree with the statement , but i think one element can not be separated from the other : this means that there are no ideas and concepts without facts , and there are no facts without ideas and concepts .
[native] > to make this kind of decision without offering a worthy place to direct people to ( ... ) clearly shows that you are not interested in finding a long term solution -- neither for these roma people nor the city as a whole how about the countries where they are coming from ?
[non-native] in todays world where the economy is growing at an uncontrolable speed , every industry is no less than a global giant , every field is becoming a money minting arena , in such an environment is will be a gross mistake to have a broad knowledge .
[non-native] in my opinion i think the advertisments should make the product more usfull than what it looks instead of making it much better than what it really is because at the end the product is made to be used not to look at only .i disagree with the statement .
[non-native] becuse it is very important that we have some people specilize in some major such as doctors be dermatologist can not see or cure canser patient who havecancer from this example i come out with my agreeness and , when i look to the knolwdge side i find that the disagreement is also can be in this matter .
[native] [ ** dempsey : france formally asks for u.s. aid in mali ** ] ( http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/jan/17/dempsey-france-formally-asks-for-us-aid-in-mali/ ) > the french government has formally requested u.s. military assistance to combat al qaeda in the islamic maghreb in mali , the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff told the american forces press service on thursday [ ** french military heads threaten to resign over ` grave ' defence cuts ** ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/10852165/french-military-heads-threaten-to-resign-over-grave-defence-cuts.html ) > french army , navy and air force chiefs and its joint chief-of-staff threaten to resign over military spending cuts , with jean-yves le drian , defence minister , warning they would render foreign operations impossible
[native] surely it would be better to work slowly by building mutual understanding and setting a record for constant compromise and negotiation agreeable to all parties , than to split up into various ` factions ' that vie to have their viewpoint heard and make future agreement between those groups more unlikely .
[native] a hate crime is a violent or property offence ( such as vandalism , arson , assault , or murder ) where the victim was selected because of their ( perceived ) race , religion , nationality , sexual orientation or similar , or where the crime was committed with the intent of inflicting fear on a community of people along such lines .
[native] turns out that overdose deaths plummet when addicts can get help quitting , when addicts have access to clean injection sites and clean needles and nurses , and when drugs are supplied from a clean , official source vs. a shady dealer who might cut it with contaminants .
[non-native] so i strongly agree with the statement `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . ''i think that trying new things and taking risks is an important factor in becoming a successful person .
[native] we shoot no one , we just lock them up on an island camp in violation of international law and let them kill themselves do not seek to emulate my country on this matter , we got at most 900 refugees by boat a year
[non-native] however i believe that it has reached to its peek and in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today , because people are becoming more concerned with environmental issues , petroleum prices are constatly increasing while its supply is decreasing , which causes financial problems and car users started to find new solutions nowadays and public transportation is rapidly developing .
[non-native] a person 's success dipends on the ability of looking at the future and understanding what the future hides ; if there 's no one who wants to do somenthing new and everybody continue to do what we already know , there will be no success and no innovation and the world will never change .
[non-native] personally , i believe taht without trying one can not taste the life .in today 's world where information is the key factor in any success and the things are so complex that every subject is related to another area , i would agree with the idea that the knowledge of many academic subjects is better .
[non-native] first , suppose you are in the middle of a conversation and people are talking about the history of the united states and because you dont know anything about history since your specialty is mathematics then obviously you will have little to contribute to and people might find you boring .
[non-native] if i 'm exploring a castle without the guidance of a tour guide , i might want to carry some sort of map or written information about the place so i can not only satiate my curiosity but also learn interesting facts in the process .
[non-native] if they are involved in a business industy that requires rapid update and application of creative ideas such as computer or car industry , i agree that sucessful people tend to try new things and take risk rather than doing what they alreayd know how to do well .
[native] maybe it 's because each member state runs its own elections , so party registration happens at a national rather than european level , but i think it 's largely because the national parties are already entrenched , and european politics does n't have enough mindshare for the european parties to compete with that .
[non-native] through my experiences , i enjoyed my college life and am be able to earn a lot of money because i studied only about tax .homenkind always need success to reach good life standards therefore succes is a very important aspect of human life .
[non-native] having a tour guide is a great privilage , as this tour guide has enough knowledge about the places visited on the trip , specially if it is a history involving trip where you can listen to a description from a tour guide rather than reading a book or watching a video about this particular place before you visit , and of course that would save even more time .
[non-native] putting such factors into consideration , i trust that the cars which will be in use after 20 years will outnumber the bein our modern time of new ways of communication via television or internet it is not difficult to make a product seem much better through advertisements than it really is .
[native] i once tried to figure out the ecological impact of the keto fad diet , which in practise sees people shifting consumption to animal proteins and fats , and it is n't easy to find specific figures for calories from animal products vs calories used to farm those animals vs using the same farmland to raise food crops suitable for human food .
[native] you do n't know nearly enough about american domestic or foreign policy for me to take you seriously if you 're trying to blame events in ukraine on cheney and the wolfowitz doctrine , if you think that cheney of all people was the mastermind behind `` 25 years '' of american foreign intervention .
[non-native] for example if you are studing history , is much more important to learn the facts and the dates of the history passages , than you have to understand ideas and concepts , but of shure this is also a very important knowledge that is required you , as historical , to have .
[native] they could explore their country , go hiking , scuba diving , for the fun of it or as an outreach method to teach people about say ecological preservation and biodiversity . . they could work to feed the homeless in their area and improve mental health provision .
[non-native] then you could jump on it taking the risk of going into a new country and being exposed to strange and maybe unkind people or you could deny it and stay in your homecountry earning an average amount of money leading a normal life .
[native] > the barman and part-time model from sunbury claims to have had an epiphany while sitting on a stone wall in dubrovnik , where he ** was told by a `` soft voice '' that his purpose in life was to `` bed heavenly blessed beauties '' ** .
[native] it 's funny how you equate `` cuddly we-want-to-save-the-world-and-sing-togheter-sub '' with our actual stance of ` let 's not murder people trying to make it to europe , commit human rights violations , and break international law '' , the opposite of what you support .
[non-native] the fact that the amount of oil to produce petrol is limited and will no longer exist as the main powering source used by cars and other means of transport , does not imply that the amount of existing cars will be reduced in twenty years .
[native] ** '' i 'm convinced uk still regards itself as a much bigger player than it is , with europe simply being too small for uk 's aspirations , thinking it somehow can remain a nexus where large power fluxes meet and the uk can wisely control them simply because uk is very smart and very special . ''
[native] english fluency and western education can lend them a decent job back home , and they 've typically worked long enough in canada that they 'll have a decent pension to live off of in retirement in poland , after factoring in exchange rates .
[non-native] furthermore , cars will have a lot of optionals that will make easier to drive for example computer car navigators or a lot of characteristics that will make cars not only a simple means of transport but also a thechnology that improve human lives .
[non-native] think about those people who did n't have the opportunity to get an education ; all they learnt was basically taken from real facts : i can say that the skills they have , for example in formulating a conversation , pheraps does n't follow a logical pattern but if they can apport facts to substain such conversation it is not hard to understand what they are talking about .
[native] germany 's * all for * the * greater good * of the european union when it comes to imposing austerity , straying a thin line with deflation & undervaluing their exports to the economic determinant of their neighbors , but fuck me if it becomes economically determinant to * germany itself * .
[non-native] if i 'm not over exaggerating recently denmark scientists have a break thtough in teletransportation of material for a few meters there might be a day we can use the fruits of this when even the air traffic is also difficult to handle but it 's certainly not in the near future as it is in budding state .
[non-native] another reason why successful people take risks and try new things is to gain new experiences from challanges and that comes to them , they test thier mettle against them and assess themselves whether they will be cope up with that challange or not and judge thier performance against new problems and chalanges they faced in thier life .
[non-native] i think studying about our own destination , resting there and scheduling the whole travel by myself is the most important things in my tour .i agree with the idea `` it is important for the students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . ''
[native] as a final point , in the uk we constantly talk about ` the grey vote ' , how the country has become a ` gerontocracy ' where pensions are sacred and everything else must be cut before they will even be considered for reform ( the pension system is the single biggest blackhole in uk finances right now , way ahead of welfare ) .
[native] > the mayor ( and the dj ) are going to get a bill from sabam , the belgian copyright agency for playing copyrighted music ; that actually seems odd - one would 've thought the dj would have a licence from sabam to be able to conduct his business in the first place ?
[native] > he said that he has given `` instructions to the military so that they have all the necessary help in the investigation of this crime '' , and that he 's requested the government 's civilian agencies to assist as best in can in the investigation .
[non-native] leonardo davinci had also confronted new challenges when he decided to attempt at flying .contrary as it might sound there are a number of reasons and phenomena that are happening around the world that may indicate the number of cars in use will drop in the next twenty years .
[non-native] in spite of all the above , the rapidly developed mass tranportation system and the widely accepted concept that health is most important in one 's life both add up to my belief that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
[native] > someone in russia comparing boy scouts with the hitler youth or buying european wine is * not * important it 's not someone in russia , it 's the russian embassy in estonia calling them nazis and its very high ranking russian officials who are buying sanctioned luxury items .
[non-native] the problem with the example listed before , is that there are some times on which people have to take some risks if they want to succeed in their careers , they have to try new things , they have to know where the businesses are going , they have to be aware of the changes made in the world with today 's globalization .
[native] nature has found a way to create a macroscopic , working , living machine ( an animal ) from a certain logical arrangement of dna molecules ... when we can process and meta-analyse vast chunks of dna at a time , i suspect we will discover staggering beauty and also a lot of very difficult ethical questions ...
[native] the reason we see so many people coming by more dangerous paths ( and hence makes who are more likely to survive ) is because of how european governments made the refugee convention work with airlines - namely that if an airline bring in an asylum seeker who 's by a refugee , they have to pay for their flight back .
[non-native] there are several reasons that people in today 's society need to own the car and as long as their passion for the car will be altered to the others ,in my opinion , the statement `` most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are '' is absolutely true .
[native] > that 's the only change that would happen , years from now we still would n't make those drawings and if we are sane enough we would leave hypocrisy behind and put that exception to the rule of our `` infinite freedoms '' just as we have made in many cases before .
[non-native] indeed , when you are yound , the mistakes you can possibly do are excused for they are called `` experience '' whereas when you are an adult , you have no longer the right to fail life is more enjoyable for young people rathen than old ones , for they do not have to worry about future the way grown up do .
[native] people elect governments to deal with shit like this , and you 're truly daft if you think apple paying less in tax than someone on minimum wage is perfectly fine with australians , or the vast majority of any country 's people , even if they do own apple 's products .
[non-native] on the other hand , there is still potential for more and people in general should always try to spend some time in helping others .although i do agree on the fact that students shall understand ideas and concepts about their particular fields of study , i do n't think that those ideas and concepts are more important that learning the facts about them .
[native] you say she 's training to be a vet , but she 's volunteering at clinics and seems to have a lot of time on her hands if she 's able to have multiple pets and yours - is she still trying out for selection ?
[native] it 's certainly a lie to say that they shared the same language and a wild guess to say that their cultures were significantly similar in most of the other respects you speak of , before the reigns of phillip ii and alexander iii .
[native] yet i somehow feel that the powers that be actually * want * a large proportion of the economy to be in destitution as it provides a cheap source of taxpayer-subsidised labour , and the drug users are rounded up and sent to prison so they can churn out licence plates , military gear and electronic goods .
[native] > it gets dull very quick , because often americans ( for example ) are ruthlessly downvoted even , or especially , if their opinions are only ever so slightly different from what some might call a commonly accepted standard-opinion in / r/europe [ 2 ] .
[native] the trouble that we 've seen with this is that it 's a slippery slope , and all kinds of justifications can be made for expanding the scope and power of the state when we allow it to violate rights only some of the time for causes we think are worth it .
[native] the point of this subreddit is the little `` out of curiosity '' things like t-shirts , graffiti and found notes ; or quick-help things like `` i 'm stranded at an airport in thailand , how do i say ` can you call me a taxi ? '
[non-native] first of all , i think that is interesting and challenging to understand some ideas and concepts we may provide a considerable concentration and it may take a long time we should have some difficulties as the result when we understand it , it providde some satisfaction .
[non-native] but also i must say that there are somethings that old people cant do anymore , never the less there are even more thing they still can do , as long as the person is surounded by his loved ones , have a good hobby or still knows how to life in the eyes of his children he 'll always enjoy life .
[non-native] a way could be let me passing the toefl .traveling is sometimes a risk if the travelar does not know about the place he is visiting or travelling to in many ways such as you may be lost in acity that you know nothing about or even be kidnapped .
[non-native] people can be alone , when you are at school you have the oportuninity to make a lot a friend because you come from the same area , the same town , you have the same interess whereas whem people get older they fell lonely , sometimes because they do n't like their jobs or it 's hard for them to be part of worklife .
[non-native] most of the brand names which are in the market now are because people find out the assumptions made by the advertising companies are true and many products after long term use were found to be contaminated and did not work the same way as advertised and they disappear from the market completely or for some time till they are up to the standards .
[native] our protests are full of people holding joke signs , and while it can be funny if you 're not used to it , after a while it ( a ) gets pretty old , and ( b ) can diminish the seriousness of the message being sent .
[non-native] the promoters will try to convince you of all the benefits of having that type of property to the point that you might agree , at the end of the presentation , that if you do not own one of those units right at that moment , you will never be able to travel again due to the increase of hotel rates and bla , bla , bla . ..
[native] since the migrants themselves have no legal status in turkey , my instinct is to say that it does not ; unless other countries accept them , the only legal thing that germany can to is likely return them to their countries of origin ( unless of course those countries are mired in war , in which case such an action would be illegal ) .
[native] come on , we 've stuck around with you guys despite you forgetting us since 1973 ... give us something , why do we need to be treated like third world citizens when we arrive at heathrow and asked a 1000 questions as to why an australian would ever want to visit the uk . .
[native] ) , it seems to be obviously dysfunctional in several ways , not least of which being that it is a state without the power of a state , and no one i 've met seems to think that it can be seriously reformed .
[non-native] to summarize , i prefer studying concepts and ideas because i think it will help me to develop more important and sustainable skills than just facts .i disagree with the statement that `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to help their communities . ''
[non-native] now instead i am study at the university architecture subject , because i love this job and i have ever loved all that is art or design ( modern art in particular ) , so now i prefer specialize in this specific subject to became an architect and to make what i love and i prefer in my future life .
[non-native] the specialize in one specific field of the job it is an the most important ability to work because for example througth this the worker can ask much money , he can have a job that it is similar at your study , he can ask the job near to the home and also he can fell more lucky to live .
[non-native] in conclusion we can not do a garduatory about what gives us more enjoyment but , in a easier way of thinking , i want to say that every age has its own enjoyment , the problem is only how to catch it .in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use that are today !
[non-native] for my answer , i will focus on the young in western societies of developed countries , because these societies are the one that i know best ( being part of them myself ) and because these societies are the one that leave the most leisure time to their younger elements .
[native] they 're not * quite * as evil as people make them out to be , and they deserve to be criticised based on their own merits ( or lack there of ) which is why i am against the blatant misreporting of them , and why i like documentaries such as this one , which pain them in a balanced light .
[non-native] first of all time is an important factor , i feel that travelling in group with a tour guide will not give us enough time to spend in all places we visit , more over they follow a schedule which may not be always acceptable to all people .
[non-native] however , what make me to disagree is that if i see the statement from now , it is impossible that there will be fewer car uses in twenty years .i think that economical growth is strictly connected to improvements in people 's creativity , that lead to new innovative solutions .
[non-native] however , it is wrong to say most of them are not helping because there are also many young people who are working hard for their communities and whenever they have time , they always think about how they will make their communities better .
[non-native] but they not let go of their ethical responsibities , and should not go to the extent of causing harm to their consumers just to increase their profits .in my opionion this statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject is wrong .
[native] if the us were to somehow magically shut down all foreign access to us-based services within us jurisdictions it would indeed cripple many services : the remaining root servers alone would have a hard time keeping up with the increased traffic , and the vast majority of us-based service companies like google would undoubtably break , but your suggestion that `` most of the internet '' would shut down is ridiculous on its face .
[non-native] actually , i think the young people have done a great job in helping out their communities .i do strongly agree with folloing statment , i think it is very important for the students to fully understand the ideas and the concepts of the subject or the topic befor learning the facts .
[native] for the uk , at least , there probably is n't going to be a problem because the uk has a strong non-discriminatory culture when it comes to such matters , and this is why every single isds suit brought against the uk has lost .
[native] and like always it ends up with the typical libertarian dissection approach to argument , cut up the person 's otherwise coherent paragraphed content and find the targets to throw in little recited arguments , i 'll make this quick : - no its not ad-populism you just missed the entire point , its not about the decisions being `` right '' its about them being more legitimate compared to elite rule .
[native] if the integration of current immigrants and stymieing the influx of new immigrants is an issue most people want to talk about , then sure , let 's debate that course - but i do n't think that 's what we 're actually dealing with here .
[native] also you mentioned getting srs ... just want to say , i do n't hate my dick , but i 'm going to get srs one day because i 'd rather * be * fucked than do the fucking , and i 'm not into anal ( ew ) :p there are plenty of transwomen who do n't mind having a penis , but still feel like women all the same .
[non-native] to be successful , it is necessary to adopt new things to go with the latest trend and it always require some risks but it 's , i think , unfortunately unavoidable in order to get success .here the topic is about , is it more important to the students to understand ideas and conceots than it is for them to learn the facts .
[non-native] eventually , we can not ignore the big importance of cars in ourlives , however , we can reduce their problems by putting alot of solutions .it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
[non-native] in fact i like competition and taking reasonable risks and i want to learn and do new things every moment .i agree with the idea that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
[native] how about we get back to my original point which is that these multinationals benefit the local economy , and back to your point which is that they do n't benefit the local economy because of the number foreigners/non-nationals/non-irish ( whichever term you 're most comfortable with ) , and the fact that you 're wrong because these same people you complain as being `` a problem '' are taxed locally and resident locally so spending in the local economy .
[native] the act of protecting ukraine when it is threatened by a belligerent , oppressive neighbour is not just important for these nation-states because the increasingly more educated and opinionated populace of their citizenry want it , but because it will protect interests of member states in the long-run and deter russia and other pariah nations from similar destabilizing attacks .
[non-native] i not saying that learning facts are not important in students careers infact once they will understand the ideas then they will start to apply those concepts but since the beginning of student career they really need to assimilate more ideas that they can even support , as much as possible i mean .
[non-native] for example , when a worker is made redundant , having a wide range of skills may sometimes be far more efficient in order to find a new job ; this seems to be even more important for people who do not have any degree .
[native] there 's also little russia can do to get rid of this situation short of complying with demands ; the russian military is hands-down the largest in the region and a very formidable force that would likely overrun ukraine if brought to bear , but it ca n't use this force against it 's chief opponents because both nato and the eu have militaries that could subdue it .
[non-native] so i am agree because , if we do n't have a social revolution before , finally , we are gona be more `` europeans '' , and more civilizated , but we are gona lost humanity anyway . ..i am going to explain why i agree that a variety of academic subjects is better than to specialize in one specific subject .
[non-native] people know this and they know product is not that good and not needed , they try to buy this because of famous person advertising it or its fake view changes people 's mind and people are greedy and advertisement use this people 's mind to make there 's look better than they really are .
[non-native] if suppose we dont get jobe but using our ideas we can earn better salary then person earning through jobs .i disagree with the statement `` it is more important for students to understand the ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts '' learning ideas and concepts are as important as knowing the facts .
[native] if you want to incentivize european creativity and innovation that 's fine , but specifically selecting and singling out american companies as the ones that need to be dealt with and i read that as controlled and mildly tolerated or eliminated , is a huge affront to the idea of the internet itself , and the concepts of free trade and openness .
[native] here is a handy graphic i made to help you understand the difference in penis size between europe and the good ol' us of a : europe : 8 = =d america : 8 = = = = = = = = = = = =d this does n't need to be a contest between europe and america .
[non-native] nowadays , people dare to change their ways of acting , their ways of thinking and just throw themselves in something new to them , because they are lucid enough to realize that nothing is free nowadays , and above all bored enough with their dull everyday lives enough to refuse to me doomed to constance and non-evolution .
[native] the author equates bandera with the ukrainian insurgent army ( which , admittedly , did conduct some ethnic cleansing , but is n't celebrated for that but rather for fighting for ukrainian freedom from the nazis and the soviets ) and nazi death camps .
[native] `` my government should protect my business '' i understand that ceta might not be in your interest , but if you think that this is the route to anything other than backwardness , where people wear `` odidas '' trainers and buy `` mucrosoft wundows '' operating systems , you are kidding yourself .
[native] ( which is also popular in the chain bakeries in germany ) yeah , dark bread takes getting used to and it 's not for everybody but there is tons of good white bread outside of germany , still being made fresh and properly .
[native] do n't get me wrong , lenin was n't a good guy , stalin was evil incarnate , and communism is on par with nazism , but we do n't need to exaggerate their crimes when they 're already bad enough to start with .
[native] good thing for the `` atrocities '' in gaza or everyone would still be thinking about the civil wars in syria and iraq , which have killed 100 times as many people as the gaza conflict and destroyed ancient minority communities in the fertile crescent .
[native] but , to answer your question . . social security was created in 1934 * so it pre-existed gats * , and would be likely to be able to avoid the gats mandate to privatize if they do not or have not changed anything .
[native] and since being pretty much full time as my real self ( a woman ) , i 've experienced first hand what its like to get called a whore by a random person on the street for absolutely no reason whatsoever : / feels bad man .
[native] if you had bothered to click on link on that `` anti-judaism '' page to the page on antisemitism , you would see it clearly states : > antisemitism ( also spelled anti-semitism or anti-semitism ) is prejudice against , hatred of , or discrimination against jews as a national , ethnic , religious or racial group .
[native] i do n't see this tax being a win for anyone , except those who own low value property -- and that 's only compared to everyone else who has to bear the costs by either changing their living situation , or by paying more rent .
[native] i probably mangle french and german in a similar way to thousands of other english-speakers , so it 's a cinch to spot me , whereas my new zealand vowels probably make my equally broken attempts at , say , hungarian , a bit harder to place .
[native] even if you take this at face value , restraining the inevitable giggling that results from the vision of putin as a champion of international law , would we really want a return to the nineteenth century vision of a world of aggressively independent nation-states , each ignoring entirely the internal unpleasantness of other states , and relying on a balance of force to keep a cold peace ?
[non-native] remembering the passed events i wish i had the independence , experience , and the mind abilities to behave better than i had , that could make may more enjoyable .i whole heartedly disagree with the statement that younger people enjoy more than older people .
[non-native] i think people who want to do something different from the otheres should travel by theirselves .a person with a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is able to understand people from all kinds of different academic fields , while a person who specialized in one specific subject is not able to .
[native] it teaches pretty basic life skills , shows you life hacks / shows you `` inspiring posts '' etc. . . and the participants commit the fallacy of assuming that just because one part of the general philosophy works , that the rest of the philosophy is correct as well .
[native] people who suffer because they are dependant on government are not my victims , they are the victims of their own bad choices , victims of the lies told to them by the state and those around them , and possibly victims of circumstance .
[non-native] for example if we are reading a theorem they thought that how it came , who will be derived this , is there is another way to do this on this they will refer many books , articles , newspapers , and in many other sources .
[native] we do n't make food with that coloring , that is our choice , but by law which you seem to ignore , we can not ban something that is made in and sold in another eu country , apart from very , very rare exceptions , which do not apply to food .
[native] the fact that [ this guy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aleksandr_dugin ) is an adviser to state duma speaker * ( and key member of the ruling united russia party ) * sergei naryshkin , as well as the head of the department of sociology of international relations for moscow state university ?
[non-native] for example , my grand mother and grand father had a lot of beautifull life when they were young becuase they never retired from the parties becuase of stranth ; however , they could not go to the parties today becuase they are too old to dance .
[native] the chinese ) specifically what european landmarks they 'd like to see , the top of the list is likely to include buckingham palace , stonehenge , the eiffel tower , the colosseum , the canals of venice , the berlin wall , the black forest etc.
[non-native] in order to conclude this essay , i would prefer that peolpe have broad knowledge of many subjects because they will be more sure that they want to be in the profesional life .before discussing this statement , we have to think about what `` enjoying life '' means .
[native] `` given the international focus of islamic state recruitment , with members from over 90 countries , we fully expect this sectarian dimension of their ideology to be brought home and to impact on community cohesion in the uk , '' he said . ''
[non-native] i believe that those who work on advertisement must cheer customers to buy , buying is what makes marketing moves , because of buying is why economy works , it is their job , and it is our right to know how it works , so i dont think its a matter of agreeing or disagreeing about it , we can not believe everything we heard or everything we saw , we must know and be able to make our own statements of the things that media brings to us , for example i dont believe on what news are telling me , it is proved that there is always some edition of the true , like when a president of some country creates a virtual reality so he can excused his self to do a lot of barbarian acts , like war , killing , polluting , and other horribe things .
[non-native] on ethical grounds , i do not support this because i believe that no body has right to play with the health and money of the population and if the product is to be sold to the population , probably the population should be told all the possiable effects that product will have , whether positive or negative .
[non-native] due to the people around me i am able to summarize theit bahaviour 's main reasons which are their lack of education and the conditions of the era they are growing .i really do not agree that young people enjoy life more than the older do .
[non-native] for example , in a classroom teacher is teaching something valuable and helping student in understanding the ideas or concepts with the help of some examples or experiments and due to this student will catch everything very fast whatever teacher has taught them and will recall it easily in future .
[non-native] i am an university student , my degree course in economic is primarly based on theory , while another university in my city bases its courses on practice ; people of that university always say that they 'll get the best preparation on their subjects because they are studing them from the real world ; as an example they watch the every day stocks variations and use models to describe them .
[native] if clinton wins we could * juuust * make it out of this mess relatively unscaved , ( compared to ww3 ) if trump wins i truly believe we are fucked , the man is so ignorant on policy and the world , if he doesnt spring us into war short-term his energy policy will do it for us long-term . .
[native] nobody wants the uk to leave but the uk leaving is less harmful to the eu than having a member who blatantly does n't care about any of the rules or values of the eu , so if it comes down to it uk exit is what they will choose .
[non-native] for example history can tell you how things happend many years ago and even can give you some usefull advises when you aregoing to make a important chiose , while math will tell you someone is just a formular person are hardly able to change it we just use it .
[non-native] to conclude , i hope that in twenty years , we can breath without carbon and pollution , that 's why i hope that policy and economic system will change and encourage the development of common transports like bus , tramway , metro and so on .
[non-native] they also usualy do not need to work and worry about payments and loans and all of the problems troubling the older persons , they only need to worry about education and their future , so they tend to play games like football , soccer , baseball and basketball , and have hobbies like swiming and riding a bicycle , going to rock concerts and dancing .
[native] seems like it is really going to limit phones in the eu though as companies move towards usb c since they will be forced to release an eu specific model that has micro usb while the rest of the world will get a usb c model .
[native] personally , i believe the prospect of eu expansion into ukraine , ukraine distancing itself from russia in favor of europe & russia loosing one of it 's most valuable potential eurasian union members to the european union was just as big a threat .
[native] the putin regime has shown that it is not interested in diplomatic measues after over half a year of extending one hand towards the negotiating table while the other is fomenting a violent uprising in the nation it is prima-face interested in keeping safe .
[native] > why is everything so simplistic and people think that if russia would immediately stop the support for `` rebels '' everything happen prior to that would magically go away well for several reasons , mostly because the heads of state of the eu have repeatedly ** said ** that ** this is exactly what it will take to stop the sanctions against russia ** ; full withdrawal of forces from ukraine 's sovereign territory , full withdrawal of backing of pro-russian rebels in the donbas , and in all likelihood reparations for the damage inflicted on ukraine by russia .
[native] the worry is that if the world demonstrates it wo n't respond effectively a great power acting in this manner , it might encourage the chinese send troops and occupy all those tiny , uninhabited islands in the pacific ( and other powers to do something similar ) .
[native] bosnia is majority muslim , and its accession to eu status seems to go unchallenged for the most part because theyve made great strides towards meeting the requirements for eu member states , if anything that demonstrates that islam is not as incompatible with europe .
[native] features some great acting , especially from the lead actor and very talented richard roxburgh ( you 'd be surprised in how much he was in that you did n't know about ) , and features many internationally renowned australian guest stars , such as sam neill ( jurassic park ) , geoffrey rush ( the kings speech ) , and hugo weaving ( matrix , lord of the rings ) .
[native] disclaimer : nobody in britain can or will get arrested for watching porn unless you 're doing it in some insanely stupid manner , such as watching it in a public library or watching porn of people ( significantly ) under the age of consent .
[native] also , europeans make crap coffee generally ( sorry italy , the quality of your milk just gets me down ) , so you can keep all your baristas thank you very much - when i was in europe and saw a flat-white on the menu , i was like omg yes !
[native] ( [ see arendt `` the origins of totalitarianism '' ] ( http://archive.org/details/originsoftotalit00aren ) 2nd chapter onward ) the way they see public healthcare is identical to the domino theory advanced in the 1970s and 1980s to justify us support of right wing dictatorships around the world .
[non-native] above these three reasons , i think in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today , and our life will be more comfotbal and safty .experts of the bussiness world determine our era as the era of advertisement .
[non-native] in conclusion , old people have some barriers to enjoy their life completely such as phsycial problems , dull senese for new skills and weak passion .i disagree with the statement that it is more important for sudents to understand ideas and concepts that it is for them to learn facts .
[non-native] as an example a person studied computerscience at university and established a company which devlop computer programs as as microsft he must be aware of other specifications as managment to be up to date in technology and compete with other to give his bestin my opinion , it is better to specialize in one specific subject .
[non-native] in conclusion , i agree with the statement that the number of people who use the car will be decreased in twenty years , for the reasons i mentioned above : severe risks that the car can bring and the appearance of the more convenience transportation such as the subway .this statement implies a double response for me .
[native] i do n't get that either - > aiding and abetting a fugitive is a crime , and for an open and shut case of sheltering one of the world 's most wanted fugitives every single person in that house should be jailed/deported , benefits withdrawn , and any sponsorships cancelled .
[non-native] not just that makes young people enjoy the life more than old people , but also the young people have more time to live and that makes them enjoy the life more than older people such as a chaild with amother and a father the chaild has long way to go and to start her or his life and time to enjoy it , so that makes them alot more enjoy the life more then an older people .
[non-native] some times i thin that many of the academic subjects for upto undergraduate level are more usefull to get wide varitey of knowledge , after complition of undergradute , concentrate on the specialized subject that is related to our proffectional academics that time its gives an more information about specialize subgect and accuire good knowledge easily and quickly .
[non-native] the car is also a staus symbol of wellness , and that is another reason why growing population such as china or asian populations in general , are going to buy cars for the next 20 yearsregarding to the statement that young people enjoy life more than the older ones , i hold the view this is true .
[native] in games when you chat it 's usually like this ; cyridius : < your message here > so my message would be '' ) '' and it would show up as ; cyridius :) that 's what i think the logic is anyways .
[native] ( and using it as a point to bash the us ) maybe you 're leaving out the other aspects of the marshall aid plan , because to include them would make the us look better than you 're trying to make it look ?
[non-native] young people nowadays , and at the contrary of the last generation , know that , to make your life better , you need to share your time , your money and your love with the others , that they need to make people around them happy to be happy .
[non-native] as a conclusion , even if any worker should be particularly competent in his specialization area , i think it is much better to have knowledge of many academic subjects , since it offers more interesting jobs and better opportunities .i agree with the best way to trave is in a group led by a tour guide .
[native] * tony brenton : western media should do better * james nixey : true objectivity is impossible * gregory feifer : putin alone is responsible for his cold war caricature * nabi abdullaev : biased journalism robs the west of its moral authority [ other discussions of the same article on reddit ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/duplicates/2coeph/is_western_media_coverage_of_the_ukraine_crisis/ ) .
[native] if someone pulls a knife or a gun on me then yeah , they 're clearly in a fucked up state of mind since they 're willing to risk a dead body and a life in prison for a few hundred dollars and my life is worth more than my phone , but if i have the chance to defend myself and my property i 'm going to take it .
[non-native] i believe that the nubmer of cars will radically increase becase there are many people who know the convinience of cars in the future especially in developing countries .there is some student who prefers to study without understand the principal ideas and concepts of what he is studying , because he thinks that it is unhelpfull or also a waiste of time ; other students , in the opposite way , prefer to pay more attention on the concepts rather than on the mere facts .
[native] because banks that helped cheat , lie and deceive should be bailed out overnight with tax payers money , but god forbid you try proven economics to recover from a recession in greece ... greece needs to default , make creditors take a haircut and then spend its internal revenue on growth ; not merkel et al 's vicarious bank bailout with ` generous ' interest .
[native] whilst a lot of american media was certainly anti-russian ( i recall an interview where some south ossetians were interviewed and when they started clearing up the story that the russians were peacekeepers , they got cut off ) , it 's a stretch to say that western media did n't cover it given that back in australia most people understood this narrative .
[non-native] finally , i suggest that those who have the ability to travel by yourself do not travel in a gruop led by a tuor guide .the speed and the pace by which technology proceeds is very fast :: if we look at the past , we can recognize how human progress and inventions have changed and restricted their own time of preparation and creation .
[non-native] of course this is not only a question of greenhouse gazes but we need to embody people who look forward to improving the world for our next generation , and this will determine for this , we are ready to leave ou car in its garage .generally young people seem to enjoy life more than old people do , this is based on the amount of activities that young people perform with respect to older people and the enthusiasm and joviality that young people put on a given circumstance .
[native] * [ alex salmond warning over shetland oil after independence ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scotland/9794316/alex-salmond-warning-over-shetland-oil-after-independence.html ) > in a letter to the first minister , tavish scott , the shetland msp , said his constituents will `` not simply be ignored , bypassed or trodden on '' in negotiations with the rest of the uk to create a separate scotland .
[native] > article published : 9:02 pm bst 15 oct 2012 we do n't actually have access to german time machines in australia so you 'll have to forgive me for not knowing how events that were predicted to unfold in 7 - 12 years from today turns out .
[native] and when today there 's a dozen people that hold the same wealth as 50 % of the population of the planet , it 's only getting worse as more of the wealth is getting sucked up by the same top 0.1 % and the inequality gap is increasing .
[native] all the tax cuts in the world are not going to help if foreign companies do not have proper roads or railroads to transport their goods , if they can not find good workers , if access to electricity is poor ( by the way , romania is 133rd out of 189 in the world in terms of [ access to electricity ] ( http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploreeconomies/romania/ ) ) .
[non-native] if the statement claims that in sixty or seventy years fewer cars will be in use than today , not in twenty years , then i would agree to it .in this period of time advertisements have a very strong impuls and influence in people 's lives .
[native] i was just reflecting the tone of the yes and no vote campaigns , i referred to the yes side as just scotland because well , the snp is the ruling party and it was the snp saying they did n't want the debt without the currency .
[non-native] the main reason that people predict the downfall of cars is because they use petrol and since petrol is limited and it 's prices are soaring a new high all the time , people predict that the running costs will eventually be so high that they will prohibit the buying of the cars .
[non-native] in a scientific theory , for example the theory of gravity , i think that the most important thing to know is the main concept of the theory : an object is attracted by the center of the earth , because everything in the universe has a force of attraction because of its mass .
[native] then to answer your point , the comparison is n't very valid because russia is actively occupying crimea , whereas the us influenced natives with bribes etc , whilst not exactly nice it 's not on the same level and incidents like this were mostly during the cold war .
[native] i realise you 've made being anti-ttip and anti-tisa a part of your identity , that you think you 're intelligent for ` working this stuff out ' , but you have n't and you should drop it because you just show yourself to be a fool .
[non-native] in my opinion the solution og the problem is in the manage of the time in particular of th efree time .depending on personal experience , personality types and emotional conern , we find that some people hold the idea of learning facts which are important .
[non-native] in my first job i wanted to try out something new and apply for a position in sales and marketing , but since i was a very good software porgrammer , everyone said that i would not be suitable for the position and most of my peers discouraged me from taking up the position .
[native] africa a wasteland , australians obviously ca n't read a map , it 's hard not to be prejudiced against muslims ( and i do n't want them in estonia or europe in general , though i 've probably never actually had a conversation with one ) .
[native] people tend to forget just how scary nuclear warfare is , and just how long western leaders will have to think of it 's cost if , for say , russia launches a lightening strikes on the baltics and deploys tactical nukes there with the threat of using them if the eu tries to dislodge them conventionally .
[native] trust goes both ways , why should greece hand over the keys to the car to the creditors when their program had contracted the economy by one third and resulted in debt to gdp of 180 % , unemployment of nearly 30 % and youth unemployment over 50 % ?
[non-native] as he is an expert , he is supposed to have visited and studied the city or country already , so you will not be disappointed after visiting a place nor get bored some day because the person who is leading the group is being paid to do his job the best as possible .
[non-native] to summarize all the mentioned points make it by far more attractive for me to gain knowledge in not only one subject but many different , although one should try no to have too many interests , as superficial knowledge in many fields of mind also will not bring you very far .although there are surely exceptions , i agree with the statement that young people in general enjoy life more than older people do .
[native] > the uk will not simply get a fta with `` free trade of goods and services '' , the eu would at that point have no economic reason to do it and even more importantly , politics would dictate that brussels take a very hard stance on the uk .
[native] if by some weird twist of fate , the us and russia actually got together and each publicly agreed to reduce the number of nuclear weapons in their armament , why would any side trust the other to actually do that and not stockpile their own supply in secret ?
[native] they are trying to portray it as meaning that people in the developed countries will be brought in to offices elsewhere to train , etc , but what they are of course going to do is use it to improve their balance of payments which means large scale privatization of services and then mandating procurement procedures which allow corporations from trading parters equal opportunity to bid .
[non-native] finally , i will always be happy to meet risky people and to know that there is more people that take life as a risk than those who are afraid to confront life , this is why i am sure that sooner or later this kins of people are going to need help , because life is based on the future and there is no future with our new experiences .the issue is that if the advertisements helps to make products seem to be better than they actually are .
[non-native] therefore the idieas and concept is more important than fact .each and every new inniovation in human history started to be used at first with a decreasing manner and then their usage has becomed more and more wide as they meet the new facility .
[non-native] now , this does not mean that the tour guide is not doing a good job , ( on the lighter side ) but , lets admit , he is no god to know every bit of everything that he is showing , and there maybe times he may miss out trivial details not deliberatly but unknowingly or due to the time provided at his disposal .
[non-native] this should be the prior aim of every university , namely to educate the student to an independent thinker .i agree with the statement that the successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
[non-native] for example picasso invented the cubism , and when he did it he was just trying new things and finally he has beco ; e famous all over the world and his paintings are nearly the most expensive piece of art on the world art market .
[non-native] and of corse you have to belve in your self and it could be one or a million of subject , you could have the best teachers of the world and if you do not cooperate you will be knowone .in my student experiences , i often used the memory to learn the fact , in the case of the lesson with a lot of dates , names or formulas but i 've always had the fundamental idea that studying without understanding principles , concepts that are at the basis of the facts could be an unuseful work .
[non-native] i take artists whose name that i have forgotted in the modern world for example , many of them like to go abroad to experince the different culture , creature in the foreign life , and study the foreign university to study and broden their mind , when they do that , they will sharpen their creation to form their sculptures , works , paintigs , and theor designs .
[non-native] as far as i 'm concerned , i perfectly agree with rason of the second group of people , in fact i think that for a student is more important to learn facts than it is for them to undestand ideas and comcepts , because in my opinion facts is the application of ideas and conception , and if a student learn facts he has more help to understand the concepts .
[native] it 'd be really great if people could stick to the issue of of the subsidies , instead of turning it into another `` nuclear power bad '' , `` no , nuclear power good '' argument that 's been played out to death a hundred times in this subreddit .
[native] > russia would only be able to commit a small part of it 's armed forces to any war in eastern europe , they would attack , then get pushed back to the urals by the rest of europe , then ~ ~ start crying like little bitches which they do every time ~ ~ they would probably crack out the nukes
[native] it 's the de facto eu capital already , it 's part of belgium which is a small , multiethnic , peaceful society , and it 's not going to be seen as unfairly favouring any one of the nations which could turn that gain to their advantage .
[native] i just thought i 'd put some other non-european countries on here , the figures are from 2013 * uae 83.7 % * saudi arabia 31 % * australia 27.7 % * israel 26.5 % * nz 25.1 % * canada 20.7 % * usa 14.3 % * japan 1.9 % * china 0.1 % source : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_immigrant_population
[native] nations named as major non-nato allies are eligible for the following benefits : + entry into cooperative research and development projects with the department of defense ( dod ) on a shared-cost basis + participation in certain counter-terrorism initiatives + purchase of depleted uranium anti-tank rounds + priority delivery of military surplus ( ranging from rations to ships ) + possession of war reserve stocks of dod-owned equipment that are kept outside of american military bases + loans of equipment and materials for cooperative research and development projects and evaluations + permission to use american financing for the purchase or lease of certain defense equipment reciprocal training + expedited export processing of space technology + permission for the country 's corporations to bid on certain dod contracts for the repair and maintenance of military equipment outside the united states .
[native] ^ so ^ i 'll ^ hear ^ none ^ of ^ that ^ `` well ^ then ^ they 'll ^ all ^ just ^ claim ^ they ^ ca n't ^ go ^ anywhere ^ but ^ x ^ for ^ fear ^ that ^ they 'll ^ catch ^ a ^ cold ! ''
[native] the agreement 's stated goal had been to `` promote economic growth ; support the creation and retention of jobs ; enhance innovation , productivity and competitiveness ; raise living standards ; reduce poverty in our countries ; and promote transparency , good governance , and enhanced labor and environmental protections . ''
[native] exactly , what britain did to the irish was treat them as second class citizens , as savages , and then wondered why they rebelled every few years with parties like ukip , they are doing as much as they can to exclude minorities from everything , that 's how you create anger and riots
[non-native] to conclude , i think that this image of the lazy selfish youg people which is very strong in belgium as well as in other countries should be corrected , lookimg at all the other young people who work hard to help their communities and even others .i strongly agree that successful people try new things and take risks .
[native] and , of course , the ratio of deleted posts both in comments and in submissions is * much * lower than in / r/europe , so even posts like [ this ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/uncensorednews/comments/5uxytf/president_of_finland_putin_not_so_bad_nato_lame/ddy727y/ ) are not only allowed to exist , but also can have positive karma even though it goes against the spirit ( i.e.
[native] i have been to france and seen the immense fields of graves - french , german , british , canadian - and to gallipoli where turks fought anzac troops in atrocious conditions , and the experiences brought me to tears from the madness of it all .
[native] > hell , there 's perhaps no system that creates more immediate wealth inequality : if your family 's rich you leave university with 0 net worth or better , if it 's poor you 're # 30k in the red before you start .
[native] for one thing , they could repeal eu directive 2001/51/ec , which basically says that if an airline brings someone that requests asylum in the eu and that asylum seekers application is denied , the person has to be deported at the cost of the airline .
[non-native] thus in terms of money , time or effort young people these days are actively taking part or they are starting their own efforts to help the communities across the globe .from my point of view i ca n't agree with the statement , that the young people of today do n't offer enough of their time to help their communities .
[non-native] it remains the consumer 's duty to understand this and to develop a more realistic understanding of what a product can and can not do in order to critically examine an advertiser 's claimsi do not agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
[native] i doubt any of them are * actually * stretched too thin answering stupid calls , i see them all the time sitting on street corners waiting to catch a driver going a little too fast or waiting outside ghettos to harrass a black kid on the off chance that they have weed .
[native] i also discovered recently that runner beans are native to the americas yet british people tend to eat them much more , we also tend to eat them differently , eating the whole seed-pod with its developing seeds whilst americans eat the developed seeds and discard the pod ( at least from what i 've read on various cookery blogs etc. )
[native] available solutions include : * allowing one nation 's police equal powers in other european countries * a multinational police force operating acording to an established treaty defining its scope there are of course other options like `` do nothing '' or `` abandon the eu '' , but for the sake of this discussion , i think they can be excluded .
[native] nato members spending less than 2 % of gdp on defense ( as of 2012 ) ( per nato guidelines ) : iceland , luxembourg , lithuania , spain , hungary , latvia , belgium , czech republic , slovakia , canada , netherlands , romania , slovenia , denmark , germany , italy , albania , croatia , norway , portugal , bulgaria , estonia and poland .
[native] if i were to offer critique , i reckon i 'd say that the ( scarecrow 's ) left leg and pelvic area could do with some deeper shading to make it more clear that that leg is coming forwards from the rest of the figure .
[non-native] when you are young , you are usually not conscious of all the dangers of the life : for example a lot of young people go out , smoke and drink a lot because even if they know it is bad for them , they can not really realise it .
[non-native] first of all , in my country there are fifty ( more or less ) associations that are pawned in social aspects , like drugs or children sick , that look for young people to learn the meaning of helping other and want to insert them in these communities .
[non-native] even in these days , when young people give more significance to their studies , there are still some out there , contributing their time to help their communities and earn a pure happiness in return .it 's clearly known that young people play more often than older people .
[native] the german government is opposed to both quantitative easing & fiscal transfers , both of which would equalize the economic situation , but at the same time erase the export advantage which allow germany to boost it 's manufacturing by absorbing the industrial markets of neighboring eurozone countries .
[non-native] for all that , our education must involve facts , but also the crafts for understand the changes of that facts , and those crafts are the concepts and the ideas .who can ever fogot when he was achild , we had to be older people .
[native] as such , there 's no risk of the eu tearing * itself * apart , because its internal forces are very weak , while the external forces of the member states are very strong - as long as they need the eu in its current form , that 's how it will be , and whatever decision-making methods they feel are appropriate for a given area of eu competence is necessarily the appropriate method , because the wishes of the member states are paramount in the eu , not any consideration of internal efficiency .
[native] and instead of violently breaking down doors and arresting people for all of the dashcams to videotape , the media simply labels anyone as a `` crackpot conspiracy theorist '' until 50 years later when it 's found out to be true and everyone shrugs their shoulders !
[native] but this is mostly because the clergy in the countryside tend to be laidback , unlike their hardline or indifferent counterparts in urban areas , on top of the fact that there 's little to no anonymity , so the locals are more comfortable interacting with them and are therefore more likely to respect them .
[native] long story short , latin imitates our 4th dimensional world , it 's words are compared with plasma , air , liquid , solid , plus the verb ` sum ' and a 5th declension for nouns which acts for void ( 0 ) .
[native] http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/10/02/uk-britain-security-anzac-idukkcn0rw13q20151002 > the discovery of the boy 's actions sparked a massive police operation in melbourne , which led to the arrest of five teenagers who were planning an islamic state-inspired attack on an event to mark the centenary of the gallipoli landings , australian authorities said .
[native] in a statement it said : `` we oppose this restriction on the turkish people 's access to information , which undermines their ability to exercise freedoms of expression and association and runs contrary to the principles of open governance that are critical to democratic governance and the universal rights that the us stands for around the world . '' celebrities such as russell crowe , richard branson , mia farrow and elijah wood piled in .
[native] sure , it * is * the west 's fault in the sense that we convinced the ukrainians our way of governance and our structures are superior to russia 's and their own , but you could say the same about both sides in any conflict .
[non-native] in my opinion student have to learn every thing practicaly so that he can remember for more time , lets take an example , lets take a lecture from a proffessor in a biology class , the professor is explaining about some subject related to frog , in this case with out seeing by testing a frog just having a figure in the black board and blindly following the textbook is not good , if you want to learn the subject perfectly then go to biology lab and test a frog then know the facts by your own and then prepare your own notes , check it with your textbook content and see wether what you studied practicaly is correct or not .
[non-native] for example , you need to attend in a competition of basketball , and you never play basketball before , you have the amnbition to try to play the basketball , but you do not have the confidence to attend in the competition because you have no confidence to win this competiton .
[non-native] it has over the years experienced different ways to portray itself and these changements have been essential for the future generations because it will give them an idea about the risks of going to the extremes and resulting from that will be a more balanced and helpful group of young people .i disagree with the statement that the successful people do not try new things and they use their preveous knowledge of what they have learned because they already know what to do with the task .
[non-native] in conclusion , this are the three reasons why i disagree with the statement .most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , i personally agree with this statement because the companies developes advertisements in order to sale and it implies many times lie about the product .
[native] i do some machine learning at work and yes you would use some combination of those things , but as part of the process you need to manually tell the algorithm what is spam and what is n't to train the weightings so that it can classify .
[non-native] because of these reasons such as focusing in one subject , employment , start to live real life a few years ago it is better to specialize in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .i agree with the statement i think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than today because the scientists will discover or project new kind of tranportation way and all the countries will improve the public transportation to defend the environment against the increasing level of pollution .
[non-native] there are zones in tokyo , the capital of japan , where privately owned vehicles are not allowed to ply because of the space crunch and only vehicles like buses , or car pools which can accommodate many people at once are permitted on road .
[native] i 'm not an expert , and i reserve my own judgment on whether it 's a good idea until more details of the proposed system were to emerge , but ** to say that cunliffe wants presumption of guilt in rape cases is massively incorrect .
[non-native] i have good experince about that i worked six years steadly working in a same manner as like other in my medical proffession but than after i shiffted to new research based studies and that helped me greatly in improving my knowledge and offcourse my life and above that patient life .
[native] if you do mention that , it is because it either is the most defining aspect of their identity ( although that 's much rarer than in case of lesbians and gays from what i 've seen - and it 's not even that possible i 'd say ) or it 's the reason why you talk about the person to begin with .
[non-native] as above the reasons i showed , i can not agree the number of cars will decrease in twenty years .if i had the chance to visit the parts of the world that i have always wanted to , such as france or italy , i would definitely choose to be accompanied by only a couple of the people who share the same interests with me rather than a large group and i would not want to be accompained by a tour guide .
[non-native] on the other hand , by understanding the concept , he would know that he is not the only one being pleased , that the sex can bring a child , and we can go further if we consider the psychological , and physical dimensions of a human .
[native] half-of-me would n't even be surprised if this is something russia actually * wanted us to do * though as it would give them * cassus belli * to basically flood into east ukraine and turn the situation into something * ala east-west germany or north-south korea .
[non-native] it will bcome possible in line with establishment of highways , constructing the huge bridges between countries and convenient carry system such as huge ferries to transport such car in passage of time , more and more people need to move by themselves for their own purpose because business will be expanded to the wordwide and it is essential to keep mobility for individuals .
[non-native] because if you have many acadimic knknowledge in diffrent subjects you wil never by succesful in one of them because you have a shallow knowledge , however if you are really specialize in one specific subject you will really be succesful and acheiving a very high postion in your side .
[non-native] i do n't know what 's wrong with our education system , however , it 's really bad because most of our yang generation are so unconsiderable for everything .it is stated that to agree or disagree with the statement ,, ` young people enjoy life more than older people do ' ,, definetly i would agree that younger people will enjoy more than older people do . . ,
[non-native] for example , i am pursing a bachelor degree in mathematics , and i know for sure that if i only concentrate in learning math i wo n't have anything interesting to talk about with other people who are not in the same area as me .
[non-native] however , i think the travel is kind of an adventure , and that it is one of the fun parts in the travel to think and plan the places where i go and the schedule for my own trip .i disagree with this statement .
[native] the truck driving company may have to adjust its wages somewhat to be attractive on the labour market , but because the income they pay is * in addition to * some portion of the basic income ( assuming truck driving is n't more lucrative than i 'd imagine it to be ) , people are still willing to do it for the additional income .
[native] i do take your point , but , again , what i 'm saying to you is that ireland had exactly those issues in our early years of membership - not only that , we kept those problems going for ourselves with some genuinely hair-brained economic policies .
[native] obviously anti-semites will always join in on an anti-israel protest and they will try and take advantage of it and distort it to try and act on their prejudices , but just because a few radical extremist assholes are involved does n't mean anything .
[non-native] but the point is that if we do not convince ourselves that we have to innovate , then other people will innovate for us and they will be successful but not us .i strongly disagree with the statment which suggests that young people nowadys do not give enough time to help and aid their communities , because young people are currently much educated and oriented than other young people who lived in the past due to the advances in all fields of education , technology , social services and becuase of the emergence of the active social charities and communities all over the globe .
[non-native] in addition , for me , it is easir to speak to other people who are strangers or other tourists or native people than if coming there in groups , because i need to think about what time is supposed to see others and how they feel about it .
[native] one without the other does n't tend to work well which is why i said the euro-zone as an example because they use the same currency and share the same central bank ( currency union ) but without a fiscal union ( budgets , taxes etc. . ) .
[native] in the case of the irish bombings in the uk - did we act like the bombings had nothing to do with ireland , talk about how not all irish people are like that , create the word northern irishophobia , or blame all the problems on anti-irish racism or inequality , or british intervention ?
[non-native] from where i stand , the necessary adjusments will be made so that car ownership stays stable or in the increase , because we should not forget that the survival of a whole industrial branch - the automobile industry - is here at stake , and this sector is ready to adapt to new trends and new requirements from the general public .
[non-native] life is rapidly moving , every thing is changing , life tomorrow will definitely be different from today , the wheel of technology is accelerating , communications have overtaken the stars , industrialization has progressed and every aspect of life is developing faster than anyone thought to be .
[native] maybe , but the problem for europe is that germany is the most dominant country and is a manufacturing economy , which means they have a much greater vested interest in keeping energy prices low at all costs and will never let any serious sanctions come into effect .
[native] they would be at a certain price if there was no eurocrisis , and they are at a lower rate during the eurocrisis because safe bond investment areas are drying up leading investors to accept lower interest rates in exchange for the safety of the finnish and german economies .
[non-native] therefore , i disagree with the idea which says that it is better to study many academic courses than to specialize in one specific field .in my country , the parents usually say to their children that you do n't have to do new things for success , risking your life , but just do what you have done well so far .
[non-native] in many schools , students are obliged to take certain subjects as part of the curriculum , but as they approach higher levels , such as high school , they may be asked to chose whether they would like to continue taking a specific subject or not .
[non-native] if we consider a person wants to specialize in genetic engineering he just can not do that without the knowledge of cell ciology , molecular biology , genetic map , instruments to be used , etc. so it is a must for him to know all these subjects from his academics in order to master genetic engineering .
[non-native] for them , at this period everything is permitted but when you will be at a certain level , it will be impossible to do certains things because of social position , because of your family and because you are becoming older , what normally means you have to be wise .
[non-native] thus , it can be concluded that the young people are not giving enough time to help the community but their attentions can be converted into the subject matter and they can be benefitted .have you ever thought about the advertisements on tv , magazines , or newspapers ?
[native] if god endows each individual that has even a single human ancestor with an intellect of its own , a reasonable rate of reproductive success and a reasonable selective advantage would easily replace a non-intellectual hominid population of 5,000 individuals with a philosophically ( and , if the two concepts are extensionally equivalent , theologically ) human population within three centuries .
[non-native] so i believe that the number of the car will surely reduce in twenty years .first of all allow me to say that i totally agree with the idea that it is much more important for students to understand ideas than to learn facts .
[native] holding that referendum was a good idea on the part of london , unfortunately sunningdale did n't last for a variety of reasons ( for example labour 's unwillingness to act against the strikers , and just their general disinterest compared to the tories ) .
[non-native] so i think that youg people do things and give enough time for their community but in a different way than adults , but i do not think that what the adults do are more important than what young people do .the role of advertisments in purchasing behaviour of consumer for any product is continously rising from a long time .
[native] i remember driving into london once , and i had n't been since well before the construction of the shard had began , and we went over a hill after we were already deep into the centre of london , and then suddenly the shard was just * there * , towering above everything like the fucking eye of sauron .
[native] economic democracy , thats what socialism is , and this changes everything because the workers wont be as quick to pollute their own air and rivers without the comfort of living far away , because the workers wont decide to pack up their factory and move it to some other nation because wages are a little bit cheaper there , because the workers wont destroy needlessly ruin their own conditions that those in capitalist firms have to strike and unionize for in vain and most importantly the workers wont decide to divert absolutely exorbitant amounts of profit away from the firm so as some person with a magic piece of paper can enjoy a cruise around barbados .
[non-native] these young people have to be admired because they are able , within a week full of things to do , to find time to dedicate to others .i agree with the statement that is more important for students to understand ideas than learn facts , but with some limitations .
[non-native] in my opinion , i think its better for the student to understand ideas and concepts more than learnning facts , because when the student understand ideas and concepts this will help him or her to understand and learn facts clearly and better , for example , the earth goes around the sun and around its self , this is a fact , but the student should know what happen when the earth goes around the sun and around it self , so he should understand that when son goes around the som that will make the 4 sesons , and when the earth goes around it self this will make the day and the night .
[non-native] in conclusion , i think it 's more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it 's for them to learn facts .the gap between young and old people is a kind of discrimination , which effects are increasing in our modern societies .
[non-native] as far as my opinion is concerned i agree with the statement `` it is important for student to understand ideas and concept than it is for them to learn the facts '' because unless i get an idea i will not know how to start with .
[non-native] during a certain period of time , the early twenties for example , young people used to think , and people around them used to make them think , that because they were young , they got their lives to live in integrity in a selfish way and that the whole world belongs to them , they just have to live .
[non-native] on the countrary i thought , and i still think , that it is not so important to learn so many informations , i 'm interested in causes , in important events , not in details : i believe that if you focus too much on details you will lost the main ideas .
[non-native] as those people get more money out of their job as a result of globalisation , they will develop the same needs which people of developed countries have today - driving into the countryside , visit friends in other cities , making holidays , etc .
[native] if you want to see some examples of what can happen with [ isds ] ( http://tpplegal.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/isds-domestic-legal-process-background-brief.pdf ) ( investor-state artificially created corporate `` rights '' ) standstill , ratchet , etc , you can look up investor-state cases and see the actual case documents ( ! )
[non-native] not that these people are not part of the society and do not contribute to the well-being of the society and become successful , but they lack fresh perspective and ideas to anything that is unexplored and unexploited , in terms of its value .
[native] this mindset transferred over into their military hardware and general strategy : american tech has usually been of higher quality , but more expensive and difficult to use and maintain , while soviet tech has always been cheap and easy to use , but ( with some exceptions ) of poorer quality and less effectiveness .
[native] until russian foreign policy catches up to the 21st century and its foreign ministry establishes itself a proper institutional culture insulated from the whims of the top job then there is simply not a shred of credibility that can be given to russian agreements .
[non-native] there is no rule that you can not stay young mentally when you are getting older ( at least not to a certain degree ) , that you enjoy your body , having accepted its limits and that you try to keep up with change .
[native] i know a lot of the mocking between our countries ( which i fully recognise comes mostly from the british side ) is largely without malice ( such as that guy building the fart machine in dover ) , but i still find it frustrating because it comes off as a reference to a different era when we have such a common history , which itself has brought so many similarities between our countries ( and their place in the world ) .
[non-native] as an old mexican saying states `` if you do not face risky situations , it is hard that you will ever win '' .newspapers are important for persons to read because in there there are many articles and so they can inform themself about the newest things which have happened in the world around them .
[non-native] resolve a problem will not be a problem because you understand the concept and then you can use it in all thefirst of all , i totally agree with the statement because in advertisement they make the product looks shiny and in its perfect conditions and the results we see on it are not real because it was shown to us by actors not real consumers .
[native] you will not find many socialists who will say `` capitalism has never done anything good '' , but you will find that every socialist will say `` capitalism is not benefiting the population anymore , it 's time we need to move on '' , and that stance is very much supported by the facts , and you can see the effects of capitalism very presently in current events .
[native] but the initials would be ee , i would n't want it named after a phone company ... maybe something relative to the fact canada , new zealand and austraila are part of the same thing their parent country is , i 'm sure there 's a name that could be used .
[native] i 'm speaking more generally of people who speak in a very similar way to this post who do hold those views and it boils my blood and aside from pissing off some anonymous random on the internet it also holds back the process of being able to move beyond the old sectarian bullshit .
[native] us take home income after tax dramatically rose [ for almost every income decile ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/23/upshot/the-american-middle-class-is-no-longer-the-worlds-richest.html ) , is still one of the highest in the world at the median , and is doing * really * well for the half of the country over the median .
[native] and if/when it goes to court , i 'd love to see the government trying to justify why they 're going after this small business owner but not the large corporations doing the exact same thing ; either they 'll have to ignore him or confront the issue head-on in the public eye .
[native] heh , i have both in leather , but i originally wanted as much wood in as possible ( including the shift knob and steering wheel ) ... but the cars are so rare in europe that i did n't really get a lot of choice .
[non-native] not only is each day become more and more special with the passage and time , but they also know they can not do everything they would like to in this limited time , so that older people may try to have as many of their dreams as possible come true .
[non-native] on top of what i exposed before , people will work more and more from home , so they would n't need as many cars than today , the boom of the internet is opening the new perspectives for the electronique learning , home offices and electronique shopping and buying trought web sites using their computers and internet connection , we can see this alredy in the mature countries where some people are n't leaving homes for days so that 's giving them less stress and more time for home and familly .
[native] or you could go in there last thing , right as they 're closing to `` get something '' , then hang around outside having a smoke and then you might `` bump into him '' and you can be like `` ayeeeee fancy seeing you here bro '' .
[non-native] and i am sure more and more people will see these advantages and there will be fewer cars .yes , personally i agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
[native] from that same nyt article ( which exposed the ransom payments in the first place and brought all this out into the open ) : > in its early years , al qaeda received most of its money from deep-pocketed donors , but counterterrorism officials ** now believe the group finances the bulk of its recruitment , training and arms purchases from ransoms paid to free europeans ** .
[non-native] hence , though the youngsters are very much entagled in their day todaay activities they should atleast have some time to participate in the community activities and help the people of the communities keeping in a mind that he afterall belongs to the community and his originn is the community .for many companies it is very important to make advertisement .
[non-native] long ago , in the time of goethe and schiller or newton and descartes , it has been possible to acquire an amount of knowledge which offered the possibilty to take part in all important discussions about all scientific topics and even about art , literature and music .
[non-native] it 's better to be an open minded person , define your life 's goal in , work for it and try different options in order to look for the best .in our society , being successful has become a necessity , due to the very strong pressure faced by the individual ever since he is a child in terms of financial , intellectual , cultural and personal achievement .
[non-native] from my point of view organized tour trips are more expensive , they lack of flexibility in order to arrange unexpected activities , and they loose the emotion of travelling to a different country and discover the real life and culture , two aspects you can not find out in the touristic scheduled tours .
[non-native] though we have very good cars today but we could build a stronger engine or the solar cars or the cars working on cells would be a greater idea in this field , letting the general public drive them at a lesser effective cost .
[native] they 're basically saying nato and the eu staged the crisis because the us economy is going to collapse and they need a war to somehow fix it , so they 're being mean to glorious and benevolent russia in hopes of getting them to attack .
[non-native] with the help of these cars , people could enjoy themselves more in an advanced society , and more time would be saved .i have to disagree with this statement , even i would prefer i could agree with it , as this would be the solution of a big problem we have nowadays , and which will be even worse in 20 years .
[native] i compared the gdp per hour worked as a percentage of that of the united states in 2011 for a handful of countries -- a means of comparing working productivity across nations , using the u.s. as a baseline , as is common in international comparisons .
[non-native] firstly , young people do not go for voting for their community , they go for a trip or abroad instead , or some people go to migration to other country , so then they do not participate their community eventhough they have a right to vote .
[non-native] in conclusion what i want to say is any student have to undertand ideas from the classroom not just memorizing and i hope that you will like this ideas .i do not agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do for various reasons .
[non-native] but it is very important to reduce this behaviour of the youth for the common good of the society .these days , many company make an advertisement because they want to market their compnay or introduce their product by using tv , news paper , magagine etc. some people think most these advertisements do n't have affect product seem much better than they really are .
[non-native] but when people who drive are tired , they can rest a little bit in the train or buses and they do not have to be concentrated on the road to go home. , they will not have car accidents which are more and more important nowadays .
[non-native] after college , hopefully you move into graduate studies and your knowledge is directed towards a specific area , its like a diamond shape effect , you learn a little bit of everything as a college student and then you learn a lot about a certain area during graduate school .
[non-native] if we compare an invidual who knows the basics of all subjects with one who knows everything about one particular subject and nothing about anything else , it is but obvious that the former would get an upper hand in more number of fields in life than the latter .
[non-native] i think that in my country right now , committing choices in young people 's learning paths are being way too much anticipated , and the risk is that the professionals of the future be narrow-minded super-experts .due to better possibilities of communicating and optimized wazs of transport , in the last century a process took place that incorporated the world : the globalization .
[native] meanwhile in eu you have countries in germany or austria that are still doing well and they look over to countries like spain and tell them to stop being so morally inferior and lazy and say `` tough shit '' no matter how bad their economy is doing while having zero control over their own fiscal policy that is influenced primarily by berlin .
[non-native] after he got his nessecary funding , he took the risk of shipping into the atlantic ocean , though many people thought that earth was flat , and then eventually , he and his ships will fall down to to the bottom of hell .
[native] it 's not my place to say whether it 's worth it or not , but for a high-pressure , 24/7 job that will cause him a lot of bodily pain for the rest of his life i 'm not at all surprised he 's made that much .
[native] it 's a decent enough reflection of europe in that regard , i suppose , but there is often an absurd amount of racism and general hate speech and what it does is generally bring the discussion down , and personally think that 's a function of users from places like / pol / coming in a flooding specific threads .
[native] they 're looking like they 're going to do very well in the next elections , but not out of their own skill , more out of the sheer incompetence of the current `` big 3 '' - labour/fg/ff sinn féin classes itself as socialist , and is 32-county republican , but the socialist part is debatable , despite the fact their past is historically rooted in the radical left ( i.e.
[native] the firearms law in canada is much looser than any european country , except maybe switzerland and also the czech republic , and we 've had only one mass shooting , 40 years ago , and our firearms homicide rate is comparable to the uk .
[native] this comes as the us schedules to cut $ 200 billion to its annual defense spending reducing it to $ 450 billion per year ; so they can use the money for investment in the north american global cities initiative , which is a ` marshall plan ' for north america .
[native] it 's preferable there 's no agreement and eliminating many problems such as pork barrelling ( less relevant in the eu ) , than guaranteeing some kind of agreement where politicians can screw with it > that goes for both sides then :p good thing i have n't taken a side , but it 's clear that the anti far outweighs the pro - mostly for the fact that the pro does n't have anything to protest for yet .
[native] > so rape of children is just a unfortunate byproduct of the refugee influx that europe just needs to take because they owe it to all these poor refugees fleeing through other countries that are already safe from violence yeah , i never said that .
[native] if you still have n't gotten after roughly 70 posts on the matter that ** the road sign vandalism is done by republican derrymen ** , it 'll take a lot longer to explain both basic macroeconomics and the history of the british empure to you .
[non-native] having a broad knowledge of many topics enables you to give more value to your community or your business , by having a more open view of the daily situations that arise and by knowing where to find a solution or who is the right person who could fix a problem .today innovation is the main task which finds many supporters not only in commercial terms but also in academic , artistic and social ones .
[non-native] for example , if your computer breaks down you will not ask someone who knows about computers but doesnt know how to fix it to reppair it for you , you will ask a specialist , someone that knows alot about computers because that is his strong point and he can fix it for you .
[native] the country is already the rape capital of europe [ source ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/20090427/19102 ) they have already blocked the deportation of a serial rapist because [ prosecutor refuses to pursue extradition of rapist as somali women need to be protected ] ( http://www.europeanknightsproject.com/somalian-man-who-raped-dead-swedish-woman-homeless-man-successfully-fights-deportation-to-somalia-south-africa/ ) it 's like social justice on steroids and then some
[non-native] for example a scientific may be keen on mathematics ; then he will wish to concentrate on the study of this field and drop out a deep study of physics or biology , even if he will need a basic knowledge in these fields since these three sciences interact .
[non-native] there are several ways between the two extrem positions , and people sould be allowed to choose the specialization grade that suits them .some people prefer to arrange a travel by themselves , while others like to join a group led by a tour guide .
[non-native] there are thousands of other examples in this world but my point is that there are always ups in dows in a persons life but if you have the will you will suceed ` as god walks with them who try ' .i do agree that there will be fewer cars twenty years from now because of quite a few reasons .
[non-native] however , no student should ever completely neglect any of these two forms of learning .ideas and concepts when undrestood are the best accompanies of understanding something i agree that its important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn the facts understanding is that all counts and the learned facts are second one to be counted .
[native] a recent multinational population survey using stopwatch assessment of the intravaginal ejaculation latency time ( ielt ) found that turkish men , the vast majority of whom are circumcised , had the shortest ielt ( [ waldinger et al. , 2005 ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16422843 ) ) .
[non-native] on the basis of the reasons and examples citied above and on the basis of my experience i would finally conclude that the advertisemnets are often misleading and do not provide the exact information and the viewers should go into the details of the product before buying them .in the given statement student to understand ideas and concepts that it is for them to learn facts .
[non-native] but its annoying to know that these people who are mostly successful when they have taken the risk or taken a chance have been successful otherwise today we wouldnt be connected to the entire world through the internet if the risk was not taken .
[non-native] so you are able to increase your current selling amout by `` tuning '' your advertisements , but on the long run you will decrease the selling amout of all your products ( not only the product you have communicated in the advertisement ) .
[native] i 'm perfectly happy to just let the un , the australian legal community , not to mention the international community , make all the many ( justified ) criticisms about how the policy is a human rights violation , inhumane , unjust , etc.
[non-native] understanding concepts will lead to the brain experimenting on its own , toying with varoius concepts and ideas , and will light the fire of inspiration and ignite curiousity , which is the foundation for enabling a student to think towards inventions and new techniques .
[non-native] it helps people to getting more interesting in different culture and country ,i agree the following statement `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialise in one specific subject '' .because for several reasons one reason will be a the student will know many subjects in different areas .
[non-native] to recap , specializing students and making them valuable for specific tasks , should help them in the future to find a position in a company where they will feel usefull and suitable .there is long point and short point about taking specialized knwoledgement .
[non-native] now i am young but when i become old i might change my opinion , like they did .in my opinion a lot of advertisement increase the desire of particular things in people and then it seem much better than another that are equal .
[native] to know the author 's work who is writing an article , an article which contains opinion ( or very strong opinion ) this is also where the media comes into play - is the article written from a neutral standpoint , or - for example rt or fox news - is there a general message you should be aware exists before spending time with articles from such sources ?
[non-native] another reason why i think that advertisements make products seem better than they really are is that i have experienced some disappointments with the products for which i was affected by their advertisements , to be more specific , i watch a movie by just looking at its advertisements .
[native] from now on if you want a gun , you have to get a license , go though a bunch of training classes , register all of your guns and new purchases with the government , and pay an extra tax for each weapon .
[non-native] however , by trying out for new tricks or moves that one has not yet done , he or she might be able to find something new that would not only help him or her make that trick , but also on other skills .
[native] i 'm sure the independent republic of chelsea would be prosperous , but hey i suppose the east acton estate descends into further deprivation as they can no longer access a decent standard of living through subsidies in the form of the tax contributions of the wealthy .
[non-native] after all the disadvantaged menioned above , it is very important for people to do some research before booking a group tour led by a tour guides , where you can find people that will be taking the tour , the guide that will be given explanations , the schedules due that most of the times are very thight and boring that do not even worth it .
[non-native] people are starting to realise what a mess of the world we have made , and the changes occuring around us such as the maldives going under water or natural disasters such as the tsunami are all effects of what we are doing to the planet and people are slowly realising what has got to be done .
[non-native] in conclusion , lack of time through their school years and lack of incentives by the their targeted university and lastly ongoing habit of not being involved in a social affair prevent young people of modern times from actively taking part in the community service .
[non-native] the tour guide is the person specialides on this kind of jobs because they have the knowledge of the place that you want to visit , that have a clear understanding of the history of that place , also the right places to visit , what to eat and what to buy as a souvenir .
[native] i definitely have this as my backup plan if all else fails , the only issue with my current flat would be the severe lack of elbow room if you had more than 7 people standing in the lounge ( it 's a bit of a tight squeeze ) .
[non-native] however , whaling or sailing has been always the subject of great travlers whether they like to travle alone or not they accompanied and guided with more experienced ones since there has been always no choice since traveling on the seas has to have a group work ( in most terms ) unless you are a lonely sailor with a small boat which goes not far away from ashore .
[non-native] if we look deepy for our sociaties we will findout that every boody agree with that opinion some where inside him , usually `` how old are you ? '' this is the first question you hear it when you apply to any job , suppose you are amanegar of any company and you want to hire an employ who you will choose old or young man ? .
[native] i mean , even if i was the most dove-ish israeli i would be worried about withdrawing from the west bank given that the last two times israel withdrew from places -- south lebanon and gaza -- terrorists took over and attacked israel from those very locations .
[native] policing the millions and millions of transactions that occur every day is not even remotely feasible , even if on one occasion by getting the attention of the fucking * state department * in the country that both the credit card companies and paypal are * based in * transactions got frozen .
[native] over the next 2 or 3 hundred years , as people slowly transitioned between the areas through trade , the english language evolved to leave behind it 's compound nature ( as half the population compounded them in different ways but if peopel stuck to the root form of the words they could communicate ) , and adopted articles from old norse .
[native] the term liberal used to mean a political philosophy based around protecting the freedom of individuals opposed to the authority of the state , in regards to politicians today it basically just means those who have the decency to apply lube before fucking us up the arse .
[native] i 'm not a big fan of letting in tons of refugees to any western country for a variety of reasons ( cost , bringing their problems/conflicts here , and large demographic change ) , but those that are deemed to be legitimate should get some assistance * at first * to help them get off the ground , but it should only have a finite duration and the program should encourage them to work and contribute to society .
[non-native] in conclution , i believe that understanding concepts first is better in the long run , because it will let students adapt to various problems , and the students will be able to learn more effectively in the limited time .a lot of students read a book and watch a movie when they are students .
[non-native] from the first word a child learns at home to the last book this person reads , each and every stage in that persons life is important .nowadays people have to struggle to become someone , there is competition since the first years of school .
[non-native] if a successful person doing the new thing then there will be another type of environment because all will help him , guide him and make his work easy with their thoughts and ideas and he can take the help of the people with his popularity .
[native] just let the politicians do their work and we 'll judge the result and make all the big decisions , rather than asking a the 500,000,000 people of the eu exactly what they think of the microeconomic effects of the ttip deal on various local industries .
[non-native] my reasons for believing this is because firstly , personally looking at my parents , hearing their experiences of their daily-lives , i picture happy , laughing , relaxed people , not stressed over homework , projects , tests , what they 're going to be later on in their life , or their duties in the house .
[non-native] we have the right to participate an activity that is really interesting to us and this may help us to learn more and experience mor from it .i would strongly agree that successful people do try new things and also take risks rather than sticking to what they already know and continuing work on it .
[non-native] coming to an end i would like to again express my hope , that at some point in time we will be independend from cars as we now know them with their noise , smell and negative consequenses on the environment and our health .the statement i am going to deal with is ` most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are ' .
[non-native] i agree that the young people enjoy life in allcases than the older oneswhen u see in many situation than the another ones some are strong in the allcases in older age also because of the stabilty of the person in the condition the takes place in situation purposes so they can be some what stabity to certain limit
[native] yea i know you were , the other people replying did n't hahaha i was responding in terms of you being uncomfortable seeing gay people , i was trying to explain how that mentality is dangerous because it ostracises a group of people , just because of some harmless form of behaviour .
[non-native] since is said about this product that a new chemical had been included on the general composition of it , and this chemical will help maintaining the hair , that it would make it growth , and it would make it look better , which means : the best product made by now , whoever person would feel the need of buying it since it would help them , and the advertisements are showing the advantages of buying this new idom ; so , this person buys it and uses it , but it does n't bring the results that she or he waited for , instead , it kind of has the opposite effect , in conclusion , almost nothing of what the advertisement showed was real .
[non-native] in biology , students must memorize a large amount of words , and from experience it is just easier if the student is able to split the word into it 's combining forms , with an understanding of the meaning of each combining form .
[non-native] another reason is that people are getting more interested in nature again and the botanical life , so a lot of clubs and tv shows like `` the green light '' are found now to encourage people to get rid of their cars and use different vehicles that wo n't make such pollution as the cars do or may be use public buses eventhogh they are polluting the atmosphere also , but they are moving anyway even if nobody uses them !
[native] there is nothing here with me being ignorant , it 's simply a matter of how the legalities of this work , and me trying to correct the people that were making incorrect statements where people were saying that it was a violation of the right to free speech ( how is removing the freedom of the press a prerequisite for freedom of speech ?
[native] the gats covers hundreds of types of water services -- sewer services , freshwater services , treatment of waste water , nature and landscape protection , construction of water pipes , waterways , tankers , groundwater assessment , irrigation , dams , bottled water , and water transport services , just to name a few .
[native] where our intervention in wwii prevented the iron curtain extending to the channel , where our garrisoning of the fulda gap deterred the soviets from annexing western europe , where the marshall plan helped speed up the post-war recovery of europe & where america 's contribution to nato * ( combined with all the other shit ) * helped provide the stability & foundation needed for pan-european integration to really take off .
[non-native] in the view of above menitioned manifold reasons i agree that to become successful in one 's life one should be bold and must accept and overcome the risks .i agree with the statement that most adevertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
[native] rather , it is the society they grew up in which failed to give them access to such resources as would help them to get meaningful employments , or at least to survive in such a way that did not require degrading and often dangerous work .
[native] i always found it curious , i 'm for a legislative ( ie : quotas ) in the short term approach , the kind that might be phased out after 5-10 years , just because i know that there is an inherent bias towards selecting males over females for better positions .
[native] here 's a lecture series from archaeologist [ dr neil price ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neil_price_ ( archaeologist \ ) ) , who has a specialization in norse culture : [ part 1 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njzbqmglhq8 ) , [ part 2 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uu2gn8n15_a ) , [ part 3 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7db9sg1pssq )
[native] > usa can put pressure on countries to align with its position , its not wise to go against so openly expressed wishes of the usa , especially not for some meaningless gestures like palestine the obama admin hates netanyahu , and the us wo n't defend israel from pressure from * other * western countries .
[non-native] also , the recent technology has increased the efficiency of a car to run more miles on comparatively less number of gallons of fuel , that has attracted a lot customers which will again account in the increase in the number of cars in the next twenty years .
[native] i do n't really know the ins and outs of power dynamics in turkey , but at least here in canada i would say that the beliefs and dress of a politician 's spouse ( unless they too are a politician ) are pretty much off limits even when they make public appearances .
[native] the fall of the berlin wall and the ussr definitely did remove the most apparent threat from western europe , but you still have central europe and eastern europe looking warily at russia , and that 's one of the reasons why they 've been drawn to nato and the eu , so that they can hedge their bets if russia decides to reassert its influences in those regions .
[non-native] well , nowadays many people do not give enough time for helping their communities especially the young people , because for example they are always busy going out with there mates , and going to clubs and malls , playing soccer , and many other sports , thats why they do n't have enough time i guess , thats what a young people at age of 10 to 18 years old people think about most of the time , well it actually depends on which country your'e talking about , because each country differs from the other , for example in this country , young people and old people help their communities most of the time , like they clean the streets sometimes , that 's what me and my mates did last week to make our area clean and good looking .
[non-native] moreover when your visit is led by a tour guide you will not waste time visting places that are no highly important , or that will not give you any idea about essential aspects of the history of the city or the country that you are going to visit .
[native] you talk of just ` democracy and its pros and cons ' , without realising that this is exactly one of those cons that has to exist in democracy , where representatives might have to shield how they voted to stop populist rhetoric pervading the place .
[native] ~ ~ also like to find an older track that sounds like dandy warhols with an organ and theres a point when the music drops away and the male lead sings `` we can work it out ( organ plays ) '' ~ ~ [ found this one , thanks .
[native] the first time the cta was * mentioned * in a public document was in a 2011 non-binding agreement of intent for cooperation on visa policies , which would be nullified by the uk leaving the eu ) or enforce a border * within * the uk between northern ireland and the rest of the uk , which was ireland 's stance at any other time when the uk has controlled immigration from ireland ( that is , at war time ) .
[native] oddly , i read somewhere once that someone ( a tv journalist , or someone ) had done a spot of maths - murders per capita , per year - using an estimated population of the fictional county of midsomer , and the years that the show had been running ; and they found that the murder rate for midsomer was still lower than the just-gun-related murder rate for the usa .
[non-native] to begin with , any product association requires the company 's high quality of product so it actually seem better when people get their product and see what their product has special things on the surface of it than just watching it through advertisement .
[native] - > the sizable traffic safety lead enjoyed by the usa since the 1960s had narrowed significantly by 2002 , with the us improvement percentages lagging in 16th place behind those of australia , austria , canada , denmark , finland , germany , great britain , iceland , japan , luxembourg , the netherlands , new zealand , norway , sweden , and switzerland in terms of deaths per thousand vehicles , while in terms of deaths per 100 million vehicle miles travelled , the usa had dropped from first place to tenth place .
[native] what * is * being said is that the system we have now already works , is already fair ( mostly ) , already allows for massive profits by big pharma , and that this system should not be changed in favour of allowing big pharma to gain more leverage over the nz pharmaceutical market -- this would lead to price gouging exactly the same way it has in the usa .
[non-native] well , if the student only knew that human body is made of carbon and water , nowadays organ transplants would be impossible , a lot of modern medical threatments also would be imposible , genetic therapy also would be impossible too , only cause we knew a partial true instead the big one .there are many young and old people who are enjoying their lives in different ways .
[native] this is why jingoistic blowhards never do well in international politics - everyone has the same history , everyone has bled and died for europe , every country existing in the world today does so because people gave their lives generation after generation for it do so .
[native] i hear what you 're saying , i think you 're a little insensitive for referring to me as my dad 's `` son '' , but aside from that , i completely understand that it can be especially hard for some parents to come to terms with .
[native] the people in the south in the us often have completely different views than mine , and sometimes their opinion wins out in elections , but any talks of secession ( or kicking the southern states out ) is never regarded as a serious option just because they have a different view .
[non-native] however its not easy to take a risk or try a new thing , you have no idea about what will happen and the consequences may be dangerous , but as i said before you hjave to try and take risk if you want success .there are a lot of people , most of them young people , who say that young people enjoy life more than older people do , but is it truth ?
[non-native] therefore , i prefer to knowledge since knowledge save a time than the trying and taking risks actions do .in my point of view i agree that people should have the risk in trying new things instead to doing things in life that he/she is used to doing .
[native] occam 's razor would point to the most obvious answer being the correct one , an incompetent bunch of pricks in eastern ukraine stole this equipment and then used it incorrectly killing hundreds of civilians , these men should be rounded up and put on trial .
[non-native] that was defenetly the best experience of my life and i could n't have the possibility to enjoy it , neither going there on my own for the first time , nor just going there with a group led by a tour guide .in my opinion , it wo n't be an exaggeration that young people do not spend time on their community .
[non-native] on the contrast the younger ones want to go on date with his/her mate this evening , he wants to purchase the latest gadgets melting the ice in the city with its features and hottie looks , what about the latest cars , and wardrobe thats in .
[native] well if you kill the president , then the speaker of the house , then the president pro tempore of the senate , then the secretary of state , then the secretary of the treasury , then the secretary of defense , then the attorney general , then the secretary of the interior , then the secretary of agriculture , then the secretary of commerce , then the secretary of labor , then the secretary of health and human services , then the secretary of housing and urban development , then the secretary of transportation , then the secretary of energy , then the secretary of education , then the secretary of veterans affairs , then the secretary of homeland security i think we would n't have a president any more .
[non-native] first of all they are very comfortable for they can transport individuals easily from one point to the other , avoiding the inconvenients of public transportation ( like suffering the weather while waiting , the noisy and narrow environment that is to be found in buses or trains , etc. ) , bringing you exactly where you have to be ( contrary to public transportation that is only present on main roads ) and being immediately available .
[non-native] the fist one is that old people have lived much more than younger people have and thus they have more experience in life , the second one is that the are more mature and for this reason they do not have extreme attitude changes as youngsters do and the last one is that old people have more money to spend since they are working .
[non-native] as aconclusion , in my opinion in the future there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .i do think that there will be few cars in use in twenty years than there are today , because we do not have enough resources as petrolem and our environment can not stand for the pollution for another twenty years .
[native] > standing shoulder to shoulder with estonian president toomas hendrik ilves , obama ticked through a list of u.s. military resources already at work in the region , and said the u.s. has a duty under the nato charter to the alliance 's collective defense .
[non-native] like , due the the knowledge of the science and technology they are in better position to help the community by gving them the information about epidamics and deasices like malaria , aids , hepititis a , b and c.and almost every young human being is doing so by just taking the jobs like scientist , doctors , working in a ngo , etc .
[non-native] several days ago we were invited as a guest in a family friend , the thing that tooks my attention was their memories about their yought years and they told us young people in the dinner that we are lucky to be young and they advise us to enjoy it .
[non-native] on the other hand if you want ot be an expert in what you aare doing then specialise in the subject that you want to be an expert in as you will have a much greater knowledge about your subject , this is laso becuase you will have more time to concentrate on your subject .i agree with the statement porpoused in wich is stablished that for students it is more important to undertand ideas and concepts than learning facts .
[native] i think some of the bigger factors for kiwis wanting to move over are economic ( higher wages + many products are cheaper ) , coupled with less of a feeling of isolation -- i mean , nz has a small population and it 's about as isolated as it gets geographically , so i think that can impact a lot on your mental health if you do n't have the money to experience much of the outside world .
[native] the only reason it works is because we have 2 giant oceans separating us everyone else ( besides us of course ) and it 's almost impossible to smuggle someone through the airport , therefore picking and choosing who we want is easier compared to europe .
[non-native] however in north america , the school requires the student to help out the communities at least 2 ~ 5 hours a semester , which means while those young people goes to school they receives the idea of helping out the communities instead of just focus on the academics .
[native] i was just trying to explain the protests - uneducated people that are getting kicked into teeth due to globalization but do n't seem to understand that in the face of overwhelming force of globalization such layoff are inevitable , and that over the long run it brings benefits to poland .
[non-native] also when a person is firmiliar with their work , new ways on how to preform a task are developed and this saves time for the person doing the job , and also increases productivity which in turn increases profits the buisness makes , but if a person keeps on jumping from job to job and not getting himself firmiliar with any one job , this will most probably end in a buisness losing profits because the work was not done by a professional .
[native] i did not go to her with these problems , it was purely for my gender issues that i was seeing her , but while i was talking she interrupted to ask if i had been diagnosed with adhd , and from there she made me do a test and requested my school reports .
[native] i fully support the french effort in africa as a peacekeeping operation , and believe it should very much become a european initiative , but do n't pretend that your country is some sort of martyr for the humanitarian cause and we 're selfish pricks for not helping you carry the burden .
[non-native] in the company , we may meet the strong compete , in this case you want keep your work you have to do sonething not belong you , can you image a boss will fire a good helper that he can help he do verything ?
[non-native] indeed , this evolution is of course necessary but requires more time to find a new valid solution and to change people mentalities .according to the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today i think these statement is wrong .
[non-native] for example , they will go to parties when the parents do not agree , or will take risks by travelling to countries where they do not have any acquaintance , just to do it , because it is cool , as they say . ..
[native] basically the tl ; dr conclusion is that western states ( first britain , then america , france and germany ) build their industrial economies through state capital investment and government intervention , and then once their economies were developed they switched over to neoliberalism and free trade policies and began preaching it globally ( either directly or indirectly through the imf , wb , etc. ) .
[non-native] when a ceo of a large company makes a strategic consideration , the process that takes place in his mind subconsciously was obtained in some random academic area he had once studied at school , and that structure of thought serves him very well in that situation .
[non-native] to conclude , i personally agree with the statement and belive in a need for change in respect of the attitude of these young peopole who do not dedicate enough time to the community they live in , and do not understand the importance of giving in something for the good of a group of individuals rather than only one .there might be different argument regarding whether in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
[non-native] in europe ( expecially in the west europe ) and america ( naturally the north of america ) , instead , we are in a different situation : we have many cars and the traffic in our cities is very strong and dangerous for our life .
[non-native] i think that car , even today , is one of the most means of transportation used and i think that this means will be even in the future , even if much people prefer use alternative means , like for example train or airplane in order to speed the travel .
[non-native] thus , as long as the importance of cooporations such as giving one 's hand for their comunities exist , the active participation of youngsters will never be limited .i agree that successful people try to do new things and take risks rather than doing only one thing that they know well .
[native] so i 'd lean towards maybe something like a little tiny shield in the corner of the icon if you 've got a streak freeze equipped , to show you it 's protected , and then the icon to be a `` frozen streak '' for the 24 hours after the streak freeze is used , to alert you to the fact that it 's been used up and your streak has n't increased , and that you 'll need to get another one or do your practice .
[non-native] to sum up , the assertion that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities is wrong and in my opinion all the problems ( small ) must be looked after by the community head .this is a very interesting question because it represents the current challenge in french education .
[native] if it were negotiated in public , vested interests of 29 different countries would be lobbying their government , saying ` if you do n't / do do this then we 'll fund the opposition ' across a wide variety of sectors , leading to deadlock because no one would be able to move .
[native] misleading > update : it looks like the official in question , state secretary of economy and energy , rainer baake , was misquoted and that he says that a mandate by 2030 will be necessary to achieve the emission goal without specifying if or when the zero emission mandate will be implemented -- we will update if baake release a statement .
[native] in the u.s. we had many minorities ( italians , irish , jews , middle easterners , indians , poles ) come in , and while they were sometimes discriminated against their communities did n't turn into 3rd world countries and they did n't blame the u.s. for their problems .
[native] the reason that is the case though , and where i see differences from living in europe , is that there has been much more adaptation to canadian culture ( while retaining aspects of previous culture ) whereas in europe there has been a trend towards creating ghettos ( not always the case , but i notice it a lot more than canada ) and a lack of integration when compared to home .
[non-native] most of the old people that we know takes medicine in order to regulate the ordinary and normal body conditions for example ; my grandmother takes pills in order to regulate her heart beats and grandfather of mine takes medication to avoid his blood presure increase abnormaly .
[native] my point is it does n't matter the ideology , like any organism it will seek to grow and survive using the tools it has at its disposal , do you think the us or russia would n't have invaded poland if it thought it was in its best interest ?
[native] i live with two mexican flatmates who spoke * very * little english when they first moved in , and while it 's improving , it 's still very broken ... and yet , their use of a vocabulary of very british slang and expressions , which they 've picked up from me , ( duolingo does not teach `` knackered '' and `` cor , blimey '' ; also , it 's said in a west country/dorset accent ) is absolutely impeccable .
[native] yeah , because trying out an exotic dish you made yourself without ever having seen , heard , or experienced it before is totally the same as going to a restaurant run by the people coming from those countries whose families have been cooking said dishes for generations .
[non-native] however these 2 reasons i stated are strong enough to make me believe the usage of cars will be fewer in the near future .in my opinion , as a student , it is very important to go deeply to parsue the knowledge in my major .
[native] i think the previsions for 2010 are even scarier : > 11 countries which are expected to lose the most population by 2100 are : the republic of moldova is predicted to lose 54.4 % of its population ; bulgaria -52,4 % ; bosnia and herzegovina - 49,6 % ; romania is predicted to lose 45.2 % of its population 45,2 % ; ukraine - 41,1 % ; latvia 35,2 % of its population , and japan - 34,3 % from its population ; while hungary is predicted to lose 34 % of its population .
[non-native] i think that the joy of life increases by time because we are given a chance to understand what 's going on in our life , getting familiar with so many aspects of it or even to get rid of some parameters of it , if we are lucky enough .
[native] over my dead body * '' ** ] ( http://www.cataloniadirect.info/2012/08/spanish-military-threatens-catalonias-independence-over-my-dead-body/ ) > spanish army colonel francisco alamán castro has declared on an interview to a spanish website that * `` catalonia 's independence will be over my dead body and many others ' too .
[non-native] i feel that , success is base in how much you know and that would be the key factor in order to get hired in the futurei agree about the saying that there will be fewer cars in twenty years than there are today , because there is more and more pollution in the air and because , in twenty years , new transportation vehicules will be invented .
[non-native] in case we see the other means of transporatation say for example buses or train they are not able to reach every where as they can not reach the remot villages the high mountain range so over there its easier for the car users to reach .
[non-native] we should study alternative system of trasport incresing the use of modern and faster machine as the magnetic train already in use in germany and china , or we just have to give a look to the past as some countryes done , reintroducing the use of pratic and . .
[non-native] but i would n't say that this is more important than learning facts , because if you have your ideas and concepts but ca n't use them for they do n't fit with reality nor with what history tells us , you will never be able to bring an interesting point of view about any topic given .
[non-native] for example if a person who already has business of his own which is running well-off but that business is older and he want to establish a new business that is not familiar to him and which is the fastest and innovative in the market , so the main essence is that how could he establish that business .
[non-native] for example , when you go to a museum , before you go , if you are alone , you need to investigate about it , and learn about it and things of that nature , so you can confirm that this museum is a good place for you to visit .
[non-native] also they have exelent health servecise they have the most advanced health facilitis in the world , you can see now that the avarage life span for the female in the usa is 79 years & for the male is 73 years , so they have every thing to enjoy thier life .
[non-native] as a result , people should be very careful in buying products and not trust to the advertisements completely .one thing i have learned from both experience in reality and in academic training is that truth should be stated with qualifications , so i would say that this statement is not a hundred percent true .
[non-native] the young who is now at the crucial stage of the life with lots of demanding responsibilities resting on his shoulders and the dreams to be realised and pinnacles to be reached , goals to be accomplished to save his face in his view as well as those who count on him , looks at the life and the obstacles in the path only with the view of overcoming them but not with a view of apprecitaion that the troubles and tough times are not forever .
[non-native] but now , when the general culture comprises more and more of a wide spectrum of cultural , religious , economic and political possibilities , i have the impression that an enormous number of people still feel attached to the culture they come from , their parents , their ancestors etc .
[non-native] this group was working from 1983 , and the most beautifull thing is that old men and women are very happy to meet new people , to tell stories in which they often recognize each other , to have a good time during the weekend ; on the other hand all the young people are very happy and satisfied to learn a lot of new things of their 's granparents lifes , of their jobs , of their loves . ..
[native] admittedly , i have n't kept up as well as i could 've and a lot of my knowledge has slipped , but these are the general trends between the us and the eu when it comes to the link between military procurement and protectionism .
[non-native] in conclusion , i believe that ideas and concepts should always be related and applied to facts , even though i can understand that that is not always the case .i disagree that it is more important for student to anderstand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
[non-native] also if you have a command one very specific subject then he can take that for his research work and come up of naive steps to really ameliorate the current state of that particular suject and this is only and only possible when you hone your talent on one subject and study its every aspect in detail ,, and mind you it will require atleast 10 to 15 years to a good command on one subject ,, so , one need to go for his subject of his choice like chemisrtry , physics , dynamics , fluid machnics etc ..
[native] one goal seems to be to create an impossible trap that entangles the non-corporate world inextricably before it becomes fully aware of this even happening . . or perhaps to eliminate any vestigial moral frameworks or sense of shared wealth or common sense or human dignity or human rights or justice , that might get in the way of the most extreme mercantile dominion possible .
[native] i see your point though , a lot of muslim bashing going on here because of how it influences the masses in what * we * see as a `` regressive '' manner not consistent with the evolution of europe ... but in reality , some european states were guilty of much worse up until recently .
[native] > a study by the centre for economic policy research ( cepr ) estimated the ** potential ** gains for the eu ** as up to ** $ 119bn ( # 91.5 bn ; $ 133bn ) a year and $ 95bn for the us .
[native] very little of it is high skill tech industry like r&d or actual development , which is why i find it amusing when people call leixlip , or dublin , or ireland in general , the `` silicon valley of europe '' , because the amount of high skill tech industry here is actually very minimal .
[non-native] for example , a successful colombian singer who goes to music school in colombia and then goes to a music academy in india will have not only the knowledge of indian music but the experience of being in another country surrounded with a different culture and people .
[non-native] people belonging to the first group have advantages in many different situations , such as academical , professional , interactional as well as emotional ones , as stated above .yes i do agree with the statement above that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
[non-native] for all those resons , i do n't belive the number of cars in use will decrease in the next twenty years although it is necessary to achieve a sustainable development of the planet .there are many opinions between the to have broad knowlege or to specilalize in one part .
[non-native] secondly , the confidence level which will be present inside him towards the subject will definetly increse to a level which can be just imaginable , so he will definetly gain a confidence due to which he can listen to any kind of doubts which arrises between other people around him and he can even make a try to clear those doubts , by which he can handle almost any different situation given to him in his life .
[non-native] to sum up , i agree with the given statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do because this only the time when they are free from boundation , responsibilities and also problems , sufferings which they have to face in future while attening their goal .
[non-native] so as an conclusion i suppose that in twenty there will be fever cars than there are today , since at least on of the aspects above will become true .many of people prefer to know only facts of something such as painting which is drown .
[non-native] i think that the mental and emotional framework in which people based their actions determines how much they enjoy life regarless their age .i think that being succesful in life depends on your personal perseption of goals , determination and commintment to your plans .
[non-native] i will not defintly blame a single factor , i believe that there are a lot of factor why advertisements make products seem much better that they really are .i do agree with the statement that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' .
[native] so , europe can fix this with quantitative easing to help balance out a undervalued german exchange rate & overvalued european exchange rate , as well as fiscal transfers from northern countries to southern countries to help bolster the economy , shore up production & stave off stagnation .
[native] > if that 's the case , best to just keep the legislative impetus at the nation-state level and they can put in common standards for human rights , defence policy , new members , and single market regulations through treaty change , if he 's really into minarchism .
[native] like , america for instance has tons of people that think america is best county in the world even if they never even left their own state and lots of nationalism/patriotism/whatever , but there are also tons of americans that openly criticize it even when there are times america is n't even doing anything wrong or involved in something .
[native] i 'm insulting a giant who blindly followed the same flawed philosophy of his flawed predecessor onto the edge of a deep , dark , bottomless pit and only when he finally fucking looked down did he stop at the last possible minute and change course .
[native] > i consider myself a post-nationalist , sorry to digress but that 's very interesting , i have a similar opinion , except i feel that nations are evolving outside of their materialistic embodiments ( race , genes , territory , language etc. ) .
[non-native] the first reason why i agree with the statment is because you are going to travel with some one who knows the place very will so you will not get lost there where if you went alone you will get lost or even you might face trouble with the people if you do not know their trditions .
[non-native] however , i am against of the idea of broadening knowledge in the acdemic subjects instead of specializing in one subject because these day requires specialist in one part and those who have a skillful in one realm also exact well in other field .
[native] there have been numerous images demonstrating how far they skew the situation just today on / r/europe as to the conspiracy comment , for that i apologise , but surely you see that a considerable portion of that userbase has a very strong aversion to msm and tends to believe the opposite of the msm narrative in an effort to seem smarter than the ` sheeple ' .
[non-native] my personal experience taught me that older people can play more sports than yonger people and older people know more about what is good for them , i , therefore , disagree that yonger people enjoy life more than older people do .i do not agree with this statement that in twenty years there will be fewer usage of cars than there are today .
[non-native] a person wont become successful just wishing and dreaming they were successful , what they need to do is get up and go out and overcome all types of adversities .since ever there are dicussions if young people enjoy life more than older people do .
[native] > such shallow self-definitions may get us through a few more years , but they have no chance at all of being able to call on the deeper loyalties that societies must be able to reach if they are going to survive for long .
[native] > the reason for the imperial action against protestants was more political than theological - it was n't a matter of religious freedom vs. persecution ( the protestants were as much against religious freedom ) , it was about the power of the emperor ( backed by the church ) vs. the power of independent princes .
[non-native] moreover , they onely focus on the theory that i used the same thing in order to at save sides , what they fail to say , is that i they did the same thing several times , you will got the same result .
[non-native] a new idea , a different vision of life , market , and so on , can cause a sudden success into our work place , family , group of friend or even into our school , and is important to elevate ourselves from the regular level of people in order to hang a better position into this selective society where almost everyone has the possibility to study , to find a job , to be competitive in a single word .
[non-native] personally i am not critic about advertisements ; sometimes i like to focus my attention on them , i do like buying some magazines just to take a look on fashion advertisements and i have to admit some of them are reallly funny and smart .
[native] i consider myself a left-leaning american on nearly all issues ( except gun rights , nuclear power and gmos ) but it 's silly to not acknowledge success in the private sector as any less impressive or meaningful as success in the public sector .
[native] had you followed other news than your eurocratic bubble i suspect you willingly close yourself in , you might have noticed a rather clear trend showing both massive arrogance and spitefulness of eu representatives as well as their desire to punish britain for daring to escape their centralist experiment .
[native] i 've done a little * rolludo * in eo before - forum rp , like [ this sort of thing ] ( http://whoniverserp.proboards.com/ ) , only one-off threads rather than a whole forum , and in eo - but unfortunately , none of them have ever lasted very long .
[native] the former colony never saw the fruit of those labours in the form of investment into the country , education , infrastructure , and so on and so forth , and as such they are seeking those benefits , which is , if you read it , what the lawsuit is for .
[non-native] you can put anything else on that measure as for example the human heart consists of four chambers that is a fact but how those chambers get filled of blood and how they process the circulation in the body that is impossible to learn or just to know without explaning till you understand the ideas and the concept to believe .
[non-native] as long the individual is involved in something that is constructive or beneficial to at least the person himself , the overall community is bound to get the benefits sooner or later , not neccesarily in explicit terms but in more subtle and impactful ways .i agree with the statement because people who takes risks and i f try new things has more chance catch the success rather than the other people who lives with the things that they already know .
[non-native] finally , on an economic scale , because of the wars , the tensions in the countries that belong to the organization of petroleum exporting countries ( opec ) , the prices of oil have increased up to more than 70 dollars per barrel .
[native] in response to the late and disgraceful conduct of this criminal in the wanton vandalism of private property in hamburg , in order that if the war against this barbarism continues the council and lawmakers hamburg should , if they judge it advisable , put into force the necessary measures which shall deter these `` artists '' from a repetition of similar outrages .
[native] and you mentioned christ-loving , and honestly i 'm an agnostic who holds no holdup of religion or whatever ; but christianity is a lot less rigid and legalistic - this has allowed christians to have more personal control over their beliefs ( which exploded after the printing press ) .
[native] > i 'm going to attribute it to the late hour and a few drinks you may have had , but attributing eastern european hostility towards russia to proper judgement while at the same time disregarding `` ostpolitik '' as failing time and time again could n't be more one sided if you tried .
[non-native] to put it in a nutshell i definitely prefer to think that human being will succeed in creating a pollution-free way of transportation , the '' new cars '' , rather than to think that we will all disappear because of ouri agree with this statement .
[non-native] i think the community spirit disappears to let place to the individualism but only in developped countries , we can see that in emerging countries the community spirit is still important , the man is less individualist and young people are more concerned by their community .young people nowadays do not give enough time to help their communities , i agree with this statement .
[native] i think any conflict with japan or the philippines is as likely as russian aggression against a nato or eu member , but i can definitely see vietnam being china 's ukraine * ( especially since they 've been increasing ties with america , but have no mdp with us ) * .
[native] [ to any philosophy people , i know this is n't the case , just popular perception of it ] > the things mathematicians/engineers deal with are the things that will ultimately dictate the outcome of any conversation you are the worst kind of stemlord .
[non-native] if they are not happy with there standarts of life or if they are so greedy that they just want more and more and they will never stop wanting or if they will not continue successfully in this buisnees for the rest of their lifes .
[non-native] because studying is not only being able to learn facts but it is also the development from a child to an adult , i agree that understand ideas and concepts is the more important .doing something which is very different from other people lies the secret of success for successful people .
[native] > i would prefer the uk to be part of a union that actually has enough economic/military ( still needs work ) power to protect our assets and push for our interests abroad , especially in the face of such recent belligerence from super powers such as russia .
[non-native] from all of the above the only conclusion came in mind is that the future of car industry and its usage as primary way of transportation will not last longer for the coming 20 years therfore the world should look for another alternative that is healthy for the enviroment and economically visible .i disagree with the stated idea .
[native] it seems that lauren - who , unexpectedly for her name , had turned out to be an asian chick - had taken her secret santa gift home , and her mother had been terribly offended and informed her daughter that i had sent her an awful racial slur .
[non-native] all in all i must say that it is not correct to claim that young people enjoy life more than older people do , because there are so many differences among all people .specialization was not the beginning of academics but after the industrial revolution specialization became important .
[non-native] however , they by far do not play such an important role as facts , or other skills not discussed in this essay , for example the ability to speak coherently and clearly , arguing and solving social problems , or teamwork .even if i agree with one aspect of the subject , i disagree with an other .
[native] just keep in mind that if you get it with the magnetic ride control shocks , they * will * eventually die on you and then you have to replace them either with new mrc shocks ( quite costly ) or do some workarounds and install regular suspension instead .
[non-native] for example , if a student of engineering pursues courses in performing arts , like dance , it might enhance the talent and social value of the person but it would not contribute to his performance in his role as an academician or a professional as an engineer .
[native] there 's a * big * difference between having a cup of coffee or tea in the morning to help wake you up and taking a highly addictive narcotic with severe side effects and withdrawal symptoms that can cause sudden cardiac arrest from regular use .
[native] `` hey , poland , i know we 've been allies for the past 200 years now and i know that you 've bailed me out of countless situations , but i 'm just gon na take this big chunk of land on our border .
[non-native] people who get amused with a certain advertisment that pop out on the television every couple of minutes , in my opinion these people are sick , because they get attracted to a certain product without even knowing what does this product consists of .
[non-native] because i believe there are several reasons that prevent youngers to be more effective in their own lives which can be based on the fact that the young people should spend much time by studying for exams or by having stress because of the uncertainity of what they will confront in their future .
[non-native] the problem is that young people do not benefit from televisions nowadays , where instead of watching useful stuff , such as ` the discovery chanel ' or ` animal planet ' , they tend to watch things that are noxious and ` brain washers ' .
[native] sorry if you disapprove but i guess that 's just the nature of the reddit beast , the platform this community is built upon , all user data is freely accessible , and in fact reddit ( the company ) has deliberately made it a trivial matter to parse/collect it .

[non-native] in the reasons stated above , i believe those who have broad knowledge of many academic subjects are more highly appreciated than are those who specialize in one specific subject , especially in the future business world .deciding whether it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject is a complex issue .
[native] the eu has little to do with this - either they request asylum when picked up by the italian navy and hence , according to un conventions , are the responsibility of the italians , or they do n't request asylum when they get to italy , in which case italy is directly going against the schengen agreement .
[non-native] so to sum up , it will be hard to realize this wish , but with an optimized concept and the co-operation of all countries , a realistic chance exists .i support that successful people try out new things and take risks than only doing what they have already know how to do well .
[non-native] the other day i was walking on a street and i see that on the other side of a road there is this man beging with a note in his hand `` need food '' and wen i looked at him and tried to walk away he had taken out another note with '' need booze '' and asking me to give him some money for what ever note i liked for .
[non-native] for exemple , you could meet a really cool 60-years-old man that does everything in his power to have fun and make life worth of being lived , and a very boring 20-years-old boy who will never step out of his house except to go to school .
[native] the closest thing we have to a railway is our train tracks ... we are building just a streetcar in downtown cincinnati and even that little thing is facing huge opposition because of `` costs '' we even got a bunch of money from the federal government for it and we 're still bitching .
[native] for instance , learning grammar and reading a history of modern britain by andrew mar ( also a good book , if you 're into british politics ) take money from the same reserve , but if i grind vocabulary it takes from the same reserve as doing mindless work ( filling in a questionnaire , doing the weekly shop , whatever ) .
[native] > apparently it 's ok for you to demand , and receive , and whine , and insult , but when it gets to chipping in with a few pennies it 's suddenly such a big deal yes , it 's perfectly ok to demand and receive what was agreed on .
[non-native] for example , i live in a littel town near milan , and if i have n't the car i can not come to work or to study in milano , because the train is ever on late , and there is n't other way .
[native] i would like to give an officer the right to shoot in self defence or defence of others and just make it mandatory for all police to wear body cameras like some regions of north america do now and design them so they ca n't be turned off .
[native] safe too drink , but run by regional privatised monopolies , who do n't have the right to cut you off but do have the right to avoid paying tax , in wales and northern ireland i believe that water is still in state hands .
[native] furthermore , there has been no dramatic reduction in wages , nor worker 's rights , because the uk is a properly developed country which has to meet the same worker 's rights laws as the rest of the eu , not a frontier free-for-all society .
[native] out of three the leaders we could have now i would arguably say he is first if he had a bit of a spine , definitely beats ed millipede and would beat cameron in my books if he just got out there a bit more .
[non-native] i remembered a historical place where i went in my country , there was no one to tell us about history of that places , it wasnt exciting like the one i had in the u.s. it is the best travel to lead by a tour guiede .it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
[non-native] in my opinion , all these examples proove that trying new things and taking risks contributes possitively to success .presently , so many people hold opionion that successful people would do what they already know how to do well by their own experiense , life style and emotional evention .
[non-native] if we take all of the factors mentioned above into consideration after a detailed observation of each point , we can come to a conclusion that , because of negative effects of the cars to environment and high gas prices , the usage of the cars will drop .
[non-native] old people have when they got to this aeg they need to enjoy the rest of their days and spend what they have saved all the past years , it is their time now spicially when beleves that they have done their jobs and it 's somebody eals times .
[native] but the large question is does the economy in which this household ( s ) operates also gain so that you have a large shadow effect that is a benefit for a larger complex system rather than the pair of shoes that you buy for less money .
[non-native] maybe it 's just another way of enjoying life , even though most people consider it boring and worthless .in this essay i would like to discuss the statement , if there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today .
[native] however , let me ask you , if you had $ 10 to spend on a bottle a wine , and your choice was a bad wine from france or a good wine from california , would you still pick the french wine to support a french wine maker ?
[non-native] this also makes a disadvantage in advertisings which shows products much better than they actually are , because if a consumer is disappointed with its buy , chances are that he will tell to at least ten persons that the product he buyed , atractted by a false advertisement is not as good as they offered , thus , these other ten persons will also chat to other people the feeling of the first disappointed consumer , making them consider other options in the same range of products to buy instead of the one advertised .
[native] especially with petrol prices so cheap ( here where i live , they are around $ 1 cad per litre or 0.67 euro , in the usa it is 2 euro per gallon ) i can sympathise with those who would prefer not to own a small city car .
[native] so we 're going to sell off our government service to someone who 's interest is entirely profit-motive , then we 're going to pay tax payer money * anyways * and then force tax payers to pay for the service itself , which will be more expensive than when it was government run .
