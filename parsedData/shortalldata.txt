[native] i 'm not saying that europe is especially racist , but no one doubts that individuals making comments about `` urban youths '' and `` melanin enriched individuals '' in american centric threads are being racist , but comments about the roma and asylum-seekers seem to be a-okay in this sub .
[non-native] second , most ads make some particular products seem better then they are and even if they are extremely expensive , especially female customers may afford to buy any cosmetique product such as powders , creams , lashes or perfumes without checking their essential needs or the utility of that product .
[non-native] its qualities as a general statement are certainly lacking .i belive that travel with a group led by a tour guide is so important and nice becoues there a lot of dangras places in the word and also maby u dont know the city vare good .
[non-native] to conclude , young people should be taught to engage in more community activities which will help them to understand an important part of lives , which is to help others to make the society more beautiful .i agree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many acadamic subjects is important a student up to his secondary school level , that is up to his ten plus two level .
[native] the elites create a set of rules which impose an ever growing burden of tribute which grows ever more outrageous until the common people convulse with anger and shake that batch off , installing `` reformers '' who over the space of several generations become corrupt in turn and then the whole process repeats again .
[native] personally , in today 's world where you live in some apartment in a town you did n't grow up in and you drive your car to some other town to work , i do n't see how you can actually form any sense of community at all .
[native] it might also be worth noting , absent any other information , that cepr is * the most * renowned and respected economic think tank in europe , primarily funded by central banks and staffed by university professors , whilst the capaldo is just a phd student .
[native] italy 's northern border is defined by the alps : arbitrary line [ here 's an image of us states that have borders defined by rivers ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:us_states_riverine_borders.jpg ) the rhine between france and germany ; completely and utterly arbitrary and , obviously , as the other guy said , tectonic plates do n't define continents .
[non-native] in last two decades the sales of cars has continuously shown upwar trend , right from small segment to large segment cars sales has increased and it is predicted that the trend will continue and so will be the increase in use of cars for coming decades .
[non-native] if the programmer knows only facts on which command leads to which result then he wil face problem in the upgraded version but if he knows the concept on which procedure the compliler works then he can also use the upgraded version though with some difficulty in the beginning .
[non-native] thus in my opinion a person who is older would be leading a more content life and would enjoy his life much more for the reason that he has time to pursue his passions and also the financial independence to do so , both of which might be a hindrance in the case of young people .some people often discus that old people enjoy life more than young people however i strongly believe that young people more enjoy thieir life than old people because they 're more heathy it means they have more opportunity and time
[native] right and you can either have an alliance of nations with trade agreements that still maintain sovereignty and identity of their nation or you can try and force a large centralized state with a primary culture and language and `` romanize '' the rest of the population and make them abandon their identity .
[non-native] if youth donot find time in helping communities then how these many communities are there , every community has its own passion , they have different cultures , they have many aims to their credit people often participatein community meetings .i do agree to the statement `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' in many ways here are the some
[non-native] another quit good example is the group of some pupils who meet older people / seniors during christmas-time for giving some hope and the feeling of being part of the society and i personally think that this is a great supportment for the whole community in a city .
[non-native] indeed , a host of countries which are nowadays in development , may reach their maturity in these twenty years -- for instance , when the asian world , such as china or india , will be considered as industrialized countries , i suppose that an indian or a chinese car constructor would be next to the toyota 's rank -- a car major companie .
[non-native] in a global world today , we also get benefits from advertisements .glance through a piece of newspapers and you will in all likelikhood see news concerned with the future trends of such careers as accountants , lawyers , doctors , and so on .
[native] it also will make countries think twice about negotiating a fta with the eu , spending all that time and money and effort only to have it shot down by one of the 28 ( soon to be 27 ) nations that all need to ratify it .
[native] if it were n't for her blue collar neighbours , aussies whose families had been living there for at least three generations , inviting her over to events with them often , despite her absolutely atrocious english , teaching her the morals and values of australian society , she would 've probably ended up just hanging out with people who were from her country .
[non-native] for example , a student can easily get what happened in canada in 1870 from the internet , he or she just simply type : `` what happened in canada in 1870 '' , he or she can get thousands of ariticles and tests which are related to the topic .
[non-native] based on those above points , i think it 's better for a morden person to specialize on a specific subject to give himself a big change to success as well as change our world .in twenty years , i think there will be more cars in use than there are today due to the development of technology in automobile industry and to the general trend of the statistics versus years .
[native] if you break off from the uk , a conservative party will pop up in scotland and suddenly the relatively-conservative scots who refused point-blank to vote for thatcher 's party will remember they have principles , and vote for the most tory-esque party that emerges .
[native] they were n't bloody joking when they called it `` operation unthinkable '' people seem to think the nukes were the answer to life 's problems , but the allies would 've gotten their shit kicked in by the red army in europe no matter how many nukes they dropped in russia .
[non-native] because of the more and more competitive educational circumstance , young people are indused to spend a great deal of time on study and preparing for exams , decreasing their concerning about other things such as family chore , community activities , to name a few .
[native] however , there 's also a large lobby group of parents who do n't like their children being able to view such things felt that most internet service providers did not do enough to help them `` protect ' their children from such influences .
[non-native] to conclude , i would say that doing new things and taking risks is totally necessary for the individual to face the diferent sides of his personality , but they do not always match with being successful in the social meaninf of the word .the issue of knowing many academic subjects or to be specialized in a specific one is difficult to deal with .
[native] he was hoping cameron would bring back a fundamental change in the relationship between britain and europe ; that britain was n't to be part of the european project , but an associate member that managed it 's own affairs but remained in the common market .

[native] there , now i 've stooped to your level and we 're both being childish and all of a sudden this entire topic is derailed because you do n't know how to shut the fuck up and accept criticism and downvote everyone that objects .
[non-native] if he knows that french people was almost starving while the queen made costume-parties at palace , he may be able to understand why the furious inhabitants of paris took `` la bastille '' , france 's most important jail and , consequently , he will remember easily the fact itself : the assault of `` la bastille '' .
[non-native] a hint that supports this point is the fact that a lot of huge car companies invested a lot of money in the developing regions of the world because it 's obvious that the future market for cars lies in these countries due to the huge amount of people that still do not own cars .i totally disagree with this statement .
[native] the western powers were not dictatorships , they were and are democracies , and the people of those countries would not have suddenly acquiesced to fighting a nation that had up to that point been their valuable allies who did the brunt of the fighting against the nazi forces .
[native] although the rules on `` indirect expropriation '' and isds seem to prohibit increases in minimum wages after an fta is signed , there is no prohibition against lowering them , so its possible that lowered minimum wages and benefits may become common , as suuply increases and demand is falling due to huge improvements in labor saving technology .
[native] do you guys think russia is all like , chip chip cheerio absorb ukraine which has been in our sphere-of-influence for centuries & deprive us of a member-state for our eurasian union while simultaneously seriously cutting down our influence in eastern europe please european union .
[non-native] this stament greatly works in the case of computer programmers , computer programmers are always confronted with the task of finding newer ways to program in order to increase the efficiency and throughput of the target systems , and so the most successful men for instance microsoft have always been ones those who did things differently .
[non-native] more and more countries nowadays use cars : in china , for example , the car industry is in great development , and as there are really many inhabitants , we must consider that it will be one of the most attractive market in a few years .
[native] if people want to leave your country you need to ask some hard questions about why that is , if people feel more european than a part of cyprus , then again , you need to ask some questions about what kind of society permits the level of hatred that can make someone want to abandon their own birthplace and nationality .
[native] i thought it was a constitutional issue , that the estonian government ca n't take away the citizenship of someone born in estonia , so if an estonian wants to get a second citizenship there 's nothing much that can be done about it .
[non-native] let me put this in another way , if one wants to go to work and he/she wants to take the bus , first he/she must wait for the bus to arrive , and when the bus arrives he/she must check if the bus is full or not and after taking the bus and arriving to work , he/she will pay for the ride which annoy most of the people .
[non-native] of course people are searching for other energy resources for cars like solar energy , and there are cars working with solar energy , but those technologies are far away from today and most probably in 20 years they would still be unusable in real life situations as the engineers believe in so .
[native] us car companies ( along with any japanese and european ones ) that wanted to sell over here in north america needed to meet those limits , which forced them all to change how they built cars and the engines that go in them .
[native] this is n't to say that the other countries were not at fault , loading the gun and pulling the trigger are two different but equally important acts , and in the same manner , germany who was the first to flout economic regulations , and acted in a totally selfish manner when it came to several economic matters , helped set up the conditions in which countries such as greece , italy and ireland could have acted with irresponsibility in the first place .
[non-native] infact a society must to send us a message that is fondamental for its life : that his product or service is good , or however really better in comparison with the ones made by the concurrency , and that we need absolutely it .
[native] not only was it filled with blatant victim blaming , it 's extremely clear that the writer has not only never been raped , but also he/she has absolutely no sympathy for those who are rape survivors , and who also want to play online games like the rest of us without being constantly reminded of an event in their life where they were subjugated and sexually abused by someone much more powerful than themselves .
[native] i 'm not a cypriot or greek so it does n't really bother me on a personal level , i just find it ridiculous that the world is pointing fingers at russia while a nato member and eu `` hopeful '' is still militarily occupying over a third of an eu country , and at the same time many have the audacity to get angry at cyprus whenever they boast relations with russia , when obviously the eu or nato does n't give a shit about them .
[non-native] so , why being closed-minded and focused on one thing we suppose the best for us when there is too many fascinating things to know ?* in my opinion it is better to specialize on one subject rather than many academic subjects but at the same time we should have a little basic knowledge about the other subjects too .
[non-native] i strongly believe that all areas of knowledge complete each other , so if a person knows about math , science , history , art , music , language and other areas of knowledge , he will be able to view life and its different situations in a better way than a person who is narrow minded by only one specific subject .
[native] not sure why the down-votes , i am not advocating them being picked up , i am illustrating that you cant expect people to fear death and turn back just because they come to a body of water , when they have already faced death and hardship in other forms earlier in the journey .
[native] > the former general , who was overall commander of polish land troops in the past and is ** currently deputy defense minister responsible for defense procurement ** , is a known advocate of having a strong polish army and being on guard for possible russian aggression .
[native] > the courts at all three levels noted that the case of accidental contamination beyond the farmer 's control was not under consideration but rather that mr. schmeiser 's action of having identified , isolated and saved the roundup-resistant seed placed the case in a different category yeah , sounds totally evil of monsanto ...
[native] essentially , the shale gas countries ( uk , poland , hungary and the czech republic ) have made it clear to the commission through lobbying that they wo n't support binding targets - and since the commission only * proposes * legislation , the best it can do under such circumstances is to put forward non-binding recommendations .
[non-native] for example , honey mooners are not likely to be keen to travel within groups let alone having a tour guide with them most of the time since privacy is valuable and treasured by newly weds and even couples seeking to spend quality romantic times together .
[non-native] for example , at schools , we all learn about theories and formulas that were invented to use to resolve problems , and that 's what we do at schools , we make a simulation of some problems that can be resolved with those tools .
[native] as mentioned earlier in my original post on this thread , ireland has a lot going for it that is unconnected to the eu ( language , highly educated workforce , good legal system , business-friendly tax system ) ... what was astonishing about ireland was that it was relatively slow to boom , when the rest of its anglophone peers succeeded .
[non-native] so i have to become older and maybe then i will be able to answer this question in a better way .i personally agree with the statement that `` it is important to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts '' . cause it is enough for a student to understand the ideas and concepts .
[native] basically , this study says that only one city in the largest economy by far in the world belongs within the top 20 global cities , while 10 cities in europe ( combining for a similar economic size ) make it into the top 20 .
[non-native] for instance , if you have seen a stone falling down from the top floor of a building you know that when you throught a stone from a high place , the stone falls down , but you do not why what phisical aspects caused it .
[native] perhaps not related to this post but i have noticed that a lot of my fellow irish people gladly call ireland `` a shit hole '' and other pleasant terms yet have never lived in another country or travelled anywhere other than to tourist enclaves in spain .
[native] however , many commercial contracts and financing contracts ( including between sovereign entities ) have provisions in them that are along the lines of the following : `` a party is not liable for failure to perform the party 's obligations if such failure is as a result of acts of god ( including fire , flood , earthquake , storm , hurricane or other natural disaster ) , war , invasion , act of foreign enemies , hostilities ( regardless of whether war is declared ) , civil war , rebellion , revolution , insurrection , military or usurped power or confiscation , terrorist activities , nationalisation , government sanction , blockage , embargo , labor dispute , strike , lockout or interruption or failure of electricity or telephone service ... '' these provisions are specifically designed to ensure that in certain circumstances the contract does not need to be honoured and ( as a lawyer i would always insist that my client includes some kind of clause like this in their contracts ) .
[non-native] for these reasons , i think it is better to know wide range of academic subjects .the agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today because of the scarcity of fuel needed to run the cars and the awareness created about the amount of pollution these vehicles cause .
[native] also to close the strait they do n't have to physically close it , a crew served missile launched from hidden tunnels/caches/bunkers will cripple any tanker it hits , simply having the ability to do this is enough to stop them sending tankers through .
[native] > they 're a low chalk escarpment , which tends to mean pretty excellent water -- the water is filtered really well through the bedrock , the slight alkalinity can depress the microbial population a bit , and streams tend to be relatively broad and shallow with very low turbidity , which means excellent uv exposure and fewer bugs .
[non-native] once they operate the computer and connect the internet , they can be , they can work , they can shop , they can chat with friends , they can take classes , they can do anything they do in the real life outside .
[native] it depends what we mean by spirituality , what i have in mind by the term is belief in non-observable forces and entities but i can see that it is often also extended to philosophies that try to come to grips with existential issues but i did n't have such a meaning in mind .
[native] the commission should also ensure that nothing in the agreement prevents the parties from applying their national law , regulations and requirements regarding entry and stay , ** provided that , in doing so , they do not nullify or impair the benefits accruing from the agreement ** .
[native] even now , with economies contracting , germany is still obsessed with deficit reduction for all governments , while its opposition to monetary easing has meant that the ecb , to the obvious despair of mr draghi , has done far less than other big central banks in terms of quantitative easing ( notwithstanding this week 's move to start buying `` covered bonds '' ) .
[non-native] this is obviously against the nature of the travel , we need more time to talk to people and share the wisdom of life , which seems a tough and even impossible task for the tour guide , since to some extent , they had to follow the simple principle , time is money .
[non-native] for instance , every human science tries to explain how human beings behave in a society : economy , philosophy , psychology , anthropology , they all give us a different theory about the way we choose , decide , react in our environment .
[native] they are also attacking the pyd in syria , so this chart is n't completely correct , yet turkish shills are doing their best in this thread to make it look like turkey is only against a small group of kurds , the largest group outside of the government in syria who is doing anything meaningful against isis and other terrorists groups .
[native] there are indoor growers but it 's hard to get because all the bush weed is n't soaking up demand , most weed you get at the moment is shit stuff , tinnies are $ 25 instead of $ 20 , or you only get 0.8 g tinnies for $ 20 , i 've had worse than that .
[non-native] but owning a car is - and will always be - a pride and a feature of independence , which leads me to assume that cars have a bright future .the situation of learnning simplely but deeply or widely is a thing depends on the time .
[non-native] in one hand , f you go by your self , you can arrange your time whatever you want , so you will be free to choose when you want to do one thing or another ; in the other hand , if you choose to go with an already confomed tourist group you can also enjoy to be with another people and have the chance to meet different persons and maybe different cultures than yours .
[native] i believe we do need to have a tough immigration policy because , yes , people do die at sea trying to come to australia , and also , lets be honest , if we did let everyone in , many many many people would come because australia is amazing ( most of the time ) .
[non-native] for example i can talk about the tooth paste that is presented more and more contolled by tests to grant security , or i can think about any other product that reguard our sanity and needs to be tested clinically and that advertisement demonstrate : i use a very great quantity of creams that i buy only with the granted name of a famous beauty factory , and this security in my shopping is given by advertisements that states their good proprieties , year by year .
[native] this would go a way towards helping to solve this , but would bring back all the problems that lead to the founding of the euro in the first place - and yes , that was a very political move but it did have its reasons .
[native] > even if in germany the german names for the cities are still the names that are used til , i thought germany would walk down from that , but given germany 's current global position , i 'm guessing it 's too late now .
[native] obviously i think the political manifestation of islam is absolutely horrific and we should work to depose isis and those like them and we should never be afraid to criticise a culture or religion but we should make sure we 're not playing into their hands .
[non-native] they all will be count the number of cars which will not decline the next - at least - 20 years .i do agree , the best way to travel is in group led by a tour guide , because even if you know the place where you are traveling , you still get very good deals at traveling fares , hotel discounts and special admission discounts on events that are going in the city where you are visiting .
[native] `` we have to accept that , because of berlin 's specific relationship with russia , we can not count on germany in matters of regional security , '' he writes , * adding that germany is treating russia `` like a special needs child who has to be raised without stress '' .
[native] buses in the uk ( except in london ) are not regulated , anyone can set a route wherever they want and charge what they like , consequently buses in leeds are more expensive than continental cities ( even london ) so i do n't tend to use them , its cheaper to share a taxi with three/four people if you 're going out so i tend to do that .
[non-native] the whole point is that as a younger person , we are at an immature stage in our lives and things may not affect us that adversely and this is a big advantage and a huge motivational factor to go out and try different things .
[native] well if you understood that , then the most logical conclusion is that you 're too stupid to understand that they achieve * different outcomes in different circumstances * , as , for example , in the difference between voting on legislation and voting in an election , which was my point and had nothing to do with historical meanings of the word , but rather what it meant in this specific example .
[native] exactly , and you did n't go into specifics on purpose , to uphold the guise that * all * allegations are false ( exemplified by your final sentence pertaining to ` they 're just looking for excuses to paint her as a criminal ' .
[non-native] however , it might be in some cases disadvantageous , as it would be a waste of money , as in the case of the hair remover .i am totally agree with this statement , i think that always the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are and this is because that is the intention of the advertisements .
[native] i was struck by this vision of community/crowdsourced translations of bits of wikipedia pages , to grow the esperanto wikipedia - like , a few sentences from a page each day , and then eventually i 'd stick 'em all together and upload the whole article .
[non-native] as a results , learning about facts and understand the points is most important than just understanding ideas and concepts .i disagree with the statement that young people nowadays donot give enough time to helping their communities.the reasons which i quote for supporting this statement are as follows :
[native] ( i 'd recently been speaking to a friend who 's a less-experienced esperantist who wanted me to correct her on things , and i had to bite my tongue the first time i heard a denaskulo drop an accusative , and get out of that mindset !
[native] gim me a few days to find some time alone to record a few samples ( not sure my flatmates want to hear me belting things out anywhere outside the shower , and not sure you want to hear them watching spanish movies and slamming doors in the background ! )
[native] ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7841890.stm ) ( as one example of many ) you write as though the fda is some banana republic arm of a junta somewhere , and ( as a more general example ) germans tend to write opinions on economics as though the [ deutsche bank had no role in the 2008 global financial crisis .
[non-native] in conclusion , at the present day there are a lot of cars that produce a lot of pollution , but i think that man is more counscious about this problem now as he was in the past , so i think that there will be fewer cars in twentcar-one of the few things which people are proud to posses .
[native] when people ask a question , and you reply with `` your mom '' then your opinion should be taken as worthless because you are either a ) a child 2 ) an idiot 3 ) a stupid child either way , not worth any more of my time .
[non-native] for example there was an advertisement about some food and they chalenge any one who can prove that is the product has any unnatural products so when some peoples do some tests for this product they say it was true the product does not contain any unnatural products .
[non-native] thus , try new things , taking risk may give a improvement of life and happiness .most of people sort some bias aganist traveling , some consider it is more fun to travel alone , but other choose to traval in agroup led by a tour guide .
[non-native] first of all , if somebody wants to travel somewhere certainly she/he must get tour or tour guide because if you have no idea where are you and you need some help from someone this person shoul be your tour guide moreover if you spend a lot money for this travel it is so normal to wants to see important places .
[non-native] so looking at the points mentioned above i am confident to say that young people enjoy life more then older people and among the various points mentioned above i feel that 's health is something thatreally against the older people is their heath .the above statement mentions that `` most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are '' .
[non-native] but at the same time our lives are filled with work and expectations for our futur , that need to be accomplished in the first place for us to go on .i 'm not agree with this sentence for different reasons that emerged from my personal experience .
[non-native] i can say this to my fellow and my younger frineds , that if you guys have wide range of subject then i will encourage you to take it as much as it can , this will surely give you positive way of your style .
[native] i get unlimited paid vacation days ( it 's up to my judgement of course , i would n't be able to take 5 months off because i feel like it ) , my health insurance through my state and employer ( i can double up ) covers pretty much everything .
[non-native] so , according to me i feel that for every student its more important to undestand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .while it is always difficult to make such strong claims and there are for sure some exceptions , i overall agree with the statement .
[non-native] obiously , the way some products are presented in advertisements make them appear better than what they really are : advertisements for pastas always shows them cooked with delicious sauces ; advertisements for burgers always show us big , perfect burgers , whereas everyone knows they do not look at all like this when we go to mac donald 's !
[non-native] as a conlusion i would say that both are importants - ideas and concepts on one hand and facts on the other hands - because they are part of a general process , they do not exclude each other and one without the other is worth nothing .
[native] there was some stuff in there about being historical friends with spain and france , oh and i 'm pretty some locals butchered some shipwrecked spanish sailors for their shoes a few hundred years ago or so but we try not to advertise that too much .
[non-native] but on the contrary , if he starts trying new jobs , specially in something he does n't know anything about , he 's taking too much risks , and he may not succeed as well as if he would have stayed in his domain and specialized himself .
[native] there 's only so much you can do when you 're a country that 's about 5-6 million ( and less if you only count the yes campaign ) against the hundreds of millions that constitute the western nations , some of the most powerful intelligence agencies etc. . . combined with all the influence and economic clout of some of the richest entities in the world .
[native] in other places in central europe i would see allot of brattish behaviour on the roads , for example at a restaurant on a roadside rest stop while i was eating my meal their was this huge commotion because germans would keep parking their cars in the parking spots that are for the truckers .
[native] maybe we could propose creating a new subreddit , / r/europeimmigration , where all posts regarding refugees , immigrants , and so on go so we do n't even have to deal with the issue of racism in this subreddit , we can pretend it 's not filled with bigots and racists - just like we do with europe in general .
[native] and you 're using slander ` republicans are acting like fascists ' , which is obviously not true as they 're not remotely interested in tripartite corporatism , a spiritual nationalism revolving around strength/resistance to pressure nor fascist-totalitarianism ( which is more liberal than authoritarianism and is a completely different concept to the standard definition , see : giovanni gentile 's explanation of ` totalitario ' , which can be found in the ` fundamental ideas ' of the doctrine of fascism ) .
[native] > 4 . the united states of america , the russian federation , and the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland , reaffirm their commitment to seek immediate united nations security council action to provide assistance to ukraine , as a non-nuclear-weapon state party to the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , if ukraine should become a victim of an act of aggression or an object of a threat of aggression in which nuclear weapons are used .
[non-native] when you think about all the different products offered for your hair , shampoos and such , for which i am very interrested , it becomes impossible to see which one you really want to buy , because they all promise to make your hair beautifull .
[native] plus , it sounds like they 're being paid for their company more than for sex , i mean why would someone pay so much money for sex when they could just go to a brothel and fuck someone for a fraction of the price ?
[native] far left parties everywhere are getting stronger , if not in the voting polls than with grass roots support , and as voter apathy maintains , these parties will be able to attract larger voting bases that * will * go out and vote for them in elections .
[non-native] to conclude , i give importance to both points of view , becaude ideas and concept are essential to start life well , but the facts will remain the best thing we can learn because the experience will always be the most important ressource for each !my altitude toward advertisemets have changed .
[non-native] to end my paper i want to decair my adversion to tour guide vacation , you spend more and enjoy less .in my opinion i generally believe when people want to be successful in their life they have to try out new things and take risks .
[native] it 's dressed up in terms of equality or social justice or `` deciding our own way '' but most of the major secessionist movements in europe ultimately come down to the idea that there 's more money going alone than there is as part of the whole .
[non-native] consequently , managing concepts and with their interaction reaching conclusion is much more productive than memorizing loads of books .well according to the question if i am agree or disagree the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
[native] what the west needs to do is provide a credible counterpoint using homegrown moderate islamic clerics to provide more western interpretations as a guideline for muslims to follow , instead of leaving it up to councils from much more extreme muslim countries to try and set the tone .
[non-native] for me , the adventure and liberty in decision are important to travel .i agree with the statement , i think that for the students is more important understand ideas and concepts , because when a person understand ideas ( he or she ) can applicate this in real life or can teach to ather people that concept .
[native] you 're being proud of being american and you 're proud of being texan , but you do n't want to be associated with the far right stereotype that often comes with being texan and therefore call yourself american over texan , even though you like being texan .
[non-native] the companies are trying to attract consumers by showing them false attributes of the products and by this way the companies will have to replant their advertisments , because it would cause damage in their image and the people will not buy again their products .academic knoweledge is very important to each individual in our days in the society .
[non-native] mostly old age people by this time are free from their family liabilities , there children are well settled and they have not worry about them , they can spend there money completely accoring to there wish and do every thing that they once wanted to do in their l on the other hand the of so called energetic young person is loses a lot of his energy fighting and keeping himself up in the cutting age competition .
[native] iran and venezuela might not have a gun to their heads yet , but they are definetely in the crosshairs of the u.s. ; especially iran , for many years now has been the apparent next big target that america wants to `` liberate '' .
[native] other than that , i 'd say one of the people most widely admired is michael collins - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/michael_collins_ ( irish_leader ) - who essentially went to negotiate with rebels knowing they 'd try to kill him , because he wanted to `` take the gun out of irish politics '' .
[non-native] population rise , the development of alternative fuels and the rapid economic development in countries with large populations will contribute to an increase in the number of people able and willing to afford their own car and thus to an increase in the number of cars in use .i agree with the statement , that young people do not give enough time helping their communities .
[non-native] in order to decrease the number of cars in use , people must be offered something new and better to use .one day i woke up i heard my dad fighting with my mom for who takes the car and goes to work and the other to go by a cap , from that reason my dad bought to my mom a car so i disagree that will be fewer cars in the coming twenty years .
[native] books like this make it out as if lgb people could n't have normal lives in this world , so they make up a fantasy place where all the virtually non-existent problems do n't exist and that is what makes it magical or something .
[native] it 's about that diesels take much longer to warm up ( thanks to better burning efficiency ) , so the engine does n't get a lot of `` warmed up '' time ... but it 's mostly about dpf , short distances kill those things .
[native] there was an interesting factoid i heard for the 1992 uk general election , which was that ~ 30 % of the electorate who voted , decided who they were voting for in * in the last 7 days * before the election was due , and an additional 5 % made up their mind * on the day * .
[native] * pacifist propaganda usually boils down to saying that * one side is as bad as the other * , but if one looks closely at the writing of the younger intellectual pacifists , one finds that ** they do not by any means express impartial disapproval ** but are directed almost entirely against ** britain and the united states ** .
[non-native] no only did i prefer to agree with this point , but also i were a witness , too .nowadays making new things is not so easy ; we live in an hyper-technological society where most of the things we have to do every day are assisted , controlled and in some cases partially performed by on or some technological devices .
[non-native] at that point , i know that people not necessarily have a lot of money to live more enjoyably but money has a considerable effect on well being and more money means more opportunities to evaluate to have fun or to enjoyment in life .
[native] outside germanic the only instance of this formation is in lithuanian , which uses - lika `` left over '' and continues the series to 19 ( vienio-lika `` eleven , '' dvy-lika `` twelve , '' try-lika `` thirteen , '' keturio-lika `` fourteen , '' etc. )
[non-native] for example if a chemistry student tries to teach physics then he surely be less effective in explaining every point because he has only limited knowledge of the subject , this will be harmful for the students he is addresing and this is quite possible that something wrong can be construed from his teachings .
[non-native] there are a lot of products that seem to be much better than they really are but with that kind of plubicity we cant denied to buy it so we buy it and we tried it but we have to beware about what it is and what it has made of so we cant have that type of problem .knowledge is an important thing for a person 's life .
[non-native] plus , a way to travel can be associated with the personality you have , because if you are a person who likes the adventure you might want to travel alone , without any plann at all , so in this way you just need to pack a small bag and have enough money to eat .
[native] before anyone asks what requirements they do n't have a central bank , which would also need a new currency , which then kicks off the requirement that they can prove they can `` withstand the pressures both within and without the eu '' .
[native] i 'm also a strong proponent of the eu principle of subsidiarity , but i 'd take it further and say it should go to subnational units , rather than national , though i 'll fairly admit i 'm in the considerable minority when it comes to this subject .
[non-native] however now , once a year , during a spring event people clean for free those riversides , and in few years it became a nice river where some people start even to fish , something that was unbeliveable until about ten years ago .
[non-native] i consider much of the advertising companies an obstacle in face of the true human progress .i totally agree with people who have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , because there are some reasons why it is better than to specialize in one specific subject .
[native] my parents would also have been some of the people you * de facto * condemned to death on the other side of the border , but fuck them right , i guess they just ran shit out of luck because they were born on the wrong side of the mediterranean .
[native] i could not care less if someone is brown or romanian who immigrates to the uk provided that there is an economic need for them and they come to work and that the uk has the infrastructure to accommodate them and they respect the uk 's values .
[native] `` on the other hand imports and holidays abroad are getting more expensive with a weaker currency which harms common citizens '' it would if german holiday destinations were n't normally southern europe ... who just so happen to be desperate enough for business to lower their prices to keep their businesses afloat .
[native] some examples : * `` monarch in talks with pm '' * `` osborne warns scots ... '' * `` queen in talks with cameron '' and `` rush to produce timetable ... '' ( its westminster producing this timetable ) * '' ... george osborne promises more devolution powers ... '' * `` westminster parties unite over scotland '' * `` leaders pledge to fast track further devolution '' this has relevance to the entire uk ( though its absolutely scotland 's decision alone ) , hence why its in the newspapers across the uk .
[native] the phrasing of the issue as `` fighting against equality '' presupposes precisely what is in question , though : if the pro-same sex marriage side are correct that marriage is between two people , then the law ought to be changed to reflect that ethical reality .
[native] but put that into the light of the study i first linked to ( cvs with swedish names vs non-swedish that showed that swedes were twice as likely to get interviews ) and i think there 's a strong case for a good deal of that discrepancy down to implicit xenophobia .
[non-native] student who understanding the ideas and concepts this makes them to achive major tasks like if we take an example of any experiment in sciences that student should know all the concepts to do that experiment like take example of a frog if the student want to experement a frog he need to know all the respiratery organs and how its lives in water and also on the land if we go just by fast that it can live in water and aslo on land that is not sufficient to do experiment on it this may lead to the death of the frog so one student should have the idea when nd in which condition like at what weather condition it servive on the land on in the water so by knowing this student can experiment it .
[non-native] another type of company is a company who wants to sell its product for 1 time and leave with the profits , so this type of company has to pay alot in a very fansy way of advertising method so the consumer can buy once only .
[native] - rebels argued among themselves whether to agree to a brief cease-fire to allow bodies of victims to be taken to morgues and about a `` fuller international presence at the scene . '' - monitors were given access to the site for 75 minutes .
[non-native] therefore i think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .there are a lot of things that a good student have to do ; indeed , i think that to study in the right way ia a very difficult thing to do .
[native] i do n't think wahabbists and salafists should be let in here just because there 's literally nothing they offer except backwards ideology , unlike the rest of islam , but if we 're going to ban them based on fighting in foreign territories then we should be pretty worried about europeans fighting in israel , ukraine and various other military forces around the world where they 'll be getting trained and radicalized .
[non-native] few concepts are often challenged if they do not have enough support of facts , to name few some of the modern scientists say that there is global warming but other do challenge them , as there is no physical evidence showing that the phenomen is relivent and do exisist
[native] the dialect of siena and surrounding areas of italy is definitely unique : they have difficulty pronouncing a hard ` c ' sound and make it sound like the h in `` hat '' ( so `` coca-cola '' becomes `` hoha-hola '' ) .
[native] there was a lot of fear of civil unrest after the war , war-time patriotism had suppressed a lot of disputes , but if that tolerance ends at the same time as a lot of young men fresh from a terrible war come back to find their jobs `` taken '' behind their back , they might not take it well .
[native] the difference between european culture and american culture in this regard is that most europeans think of any other european country as an equal and so the jokes and making fun for us , does n't have the possibility of have a sinister tone about it .
[native] the ecb intervention came at a time when irish sovereign bond yields were rocketing upwards , deposits were fleeing the banks , and the banks had already borrowed something around $ 100billion from the ecb to pay off the bonds the government had unilaterally guaranteed in 2008 .
[native] from a comment in / r/unitedkingdom > a single retired un official ≠ `` the un '' > edit ( for clarity ) : [ alfred-maurice de zayas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alfred-maurice_de_zayas ) , does currently have a role in the un as an ' ** independent ** expert on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order ' .
[non-native] to conclude , i do agee with the quotation that there will be fewer cars in the next twenty years , but at the same time i say that it would be very costly affair to get the quote right with every individual . .it is good to have knowledge on many academic subjects , however , upto what extent we need that amount of knowledge is questionable .
[native] i think it 's more than likely that the economy will correct these difficulties in the long-term -- prices will probably rise at first but then they will go down , and professions will be able to capitalize on specialized labour if the demand exists ( and certainly there is perpetual need in some fields , like medicine ) -- but the situation might not be particularly enviable at first .
[native] i might 've mischaracterized the situation before with the * `` much smaller '' * logistical footprint comment , but i do n't know the exact specifics so i ca n't say , although * i do know * the less fuel you need , the more food you have & the less targets * ( resupply ships ) * you give the enemy is not something you should underestimate in a conflict .
[native] even having an ancestor history of being ` australian ' for hundreds of years i was still ` english ' to my friends mum , who like her son was born in australia but was still as ` greek ' as ever a greek could be , because her parents were greek .
[non-native] i think that this is true because now everithing is linked to one another , you may find many things that are related to your job but are not the base of your focus , this will force you to adapt to the problem in matter .
[non-native] it does not matter whether science advances so far as to transport a person from one point to other through virtual domain but science would have certainly progressed enough to discourage people from using cars by providing them with ample of other transportation facilities which would finally lead to a reduction in number of cars in use twenty years later then there are today .nowadays , people argue that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
[non-native] finally each of the car & internet services have their advantages & disadvantages , i believe in twenty years there will be modern technolog service more that the cars & internt also .i agree with that young people enjoy life more than older people ,
[native] i 'm also saying that devaluing the eur relative to usd is neutral as regards italy 's ability to service its debts as the the devuation of the eur to usd impacts the size of the debt and the size of the gdp in the same way .
[non-native] eventhough you can get some knowledge from books and internet about the cities and important places , tour guides give you the exact information you need to know such as theorical facts but also myths , leyends and beliefs , which many times are more interesting and not found in books .
[non-native] in certain cases luck does not favour us even though we worked hardly to achive our goals , though we trust our hard work and self confidence some times things go wrong when we were trying to achieve success by single trail it self .
[non-native] people say that the communiteis and the culture is built on there young people hands and that explains that young people have lots of enjoiable things that they live for and old people must give the cahnce for the young people becuse they had theier own chance .students education should be complete in order to let young people develop their own way of thinking in all the majors like maths , physics , psicology and art .
[non-native] to sum up , in my opinion expenses of car usage , environmental problems that car usage cause and developing alternatives to the cars with improved technology will cause a reduction in car usage in twenty years .i believe learning ideas and concepts is far more rewarding for students than only learning a bunch of meaningless facts .
[native] other people have made some very good points , one thing i 'd like to add about litterbox training ... if you find she piddles on the couch/bed etc , it 's cause bunnies like to go up out of their burrow to pee ... if you raise her litterbox off the ground a little , it might help her feel good about going up to pee ... got ta let her fulfill her instincts :)
[non-native] for conclusion , i think if you want to be successful , you should be creative enough to undertake the risks that can be follow your creativity , because in that way , you can have your own solutions to be successful , and that you can learn from the failure if you had failed .from the primary school to the end of highschool , in france , england or in the united states , students learned a significant number of various subject which means they not have to operate a decisive choice in one or two subject they will have to study .
[native] i think it 's just sad that instead of using the council of europe as a tool for putting pressure on governments to improve human rights and democratic freedoms , it seems to be used as a cover to legitimise the behaviour of dodgy regimes .
[non-native] after all , all the concepts are from the real life and they are changing by the experience of fact as time passes .in the present world as their is a rapid change in the development in student in all the aspects i.e in iq , sports , information technology , electornics , media and many other fields and more over in school studies .
[non-native] however , there are still certain examples today of people who have left colleges and their well paying jobs to start some venture to help their community , the example of a famour nri is inspiration for all who left his multi million dollars job to start micro finance project in rural india which has become the first and biggest organisation of such kind .
[non-native] for instance , one one of my friends decided to go to a town that is known not only its water falls but also for mafia groups that it hold and when i advised him to be careful and acompany a tour guide , he refused .
[non-native] so in my opinoun the student who understand ideas and concepts is more important than the students who learn facts so as to face different compitative exams which are likely to held in every part of the life , where they test only the output of the student rather than how much he knows about factsit can not be denied that travel may bring lots of fun and pleasure to the people who travel .
[non-native] the first one would be to travel in a very small group , and to take notes from internet web pages such as www.asmallworld.com which offers opinions from people who actually recommend the best places to go to , and rank them , and even explain the real situation of every country by their own citizens views , one can even talk to them and find out about almost everything there is to know about any city .
[native] while i hate that appealing to the median voter is enough to get elected here in canada under fptp , in new democracies like bosnia or egypt it would really help if political parties tried to find common ground on issues ( say the economy ) that transcends ethnopolitical lines .
[native] so , health care in the usa is not locked up in privatization as they say , because the people have never and would never agree , we 've been [ promised single payer is right around the corner ] ( http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/aug/10/reid-says-obamacare-just-step-toward-eventual-sing/ ) , even as they work [ behind closed doors ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_ppqnbxpa4 ) to cut off any hope of it .
[non-native] the first reason that i agree that there will be fewer cars in the future is the pace of the technolegy which is improve very quickly in the recent years so after twenty years the people will use a vichle more modern than cars .
[non-native] that what they encourage now in the very high standared art schools all over the world , you take few years leaning how to draw and paint and see musumes but the main pat in there plane to make good artists is to give a big space to think .
[native] before long the european commission , the council of europe , the uk government , human rights watch , amnesty international and many other non-governmental and international organisations had all sent their own tweets deploring what they depicted as an attack on free speech .
[native] standing on the sidelines and making statements that have no real bearing on the present conversation but * appear * to introduce doubt in the concerns being raised is an all too common and unfortunately effective way of unjustly dismissing those concerns in people 's minds .
[native] also , this : > many roles were decided on personal favour -- hence how a first world war fighter pilot with no financial experience would be selected to run germany 's attempt at centralised economy , rather than the accomplished and experienced banker hjalmar schacht .
[non-native] in conclusion , people should n't believe all the advertisents they sea in th road or on tv because it 's not true everytimei disagree that , successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
[native] no , this is all russia 's fault , even though isis has lost more territory since the russian campaign in syria started than all the time previous , no , this is just all some ploy by putin to distract from ukraine and not support their biggest ally in the region against terrorists .
[non-native] if we try to make a general analysis about what is beleived in modern societies that succes may bring to a person , the arguments would orbit around phraes like `` money eventually can make you succesful '' , the same thing with fame .
[non-native] second , becouse of the growth of the world and the technological advances poeple are more often expossed to advertisement , and competition has grown , so the only way of wining is by advertising anything , and as long as it sails is fine for any company who needs advertising .
[native] compared to wp ie it has incomparably better tab management , it does not stupidly display each tab as a new process , it has a forward button , it can clear only cookies without wiping the history as well , it has speed-dial page .
[native] so while yes people can set up democratic firms in todays system their attempts are always undermined by the superior resources of the already existing capitalist firms , they will be bought out , pushed aside and undercut by economies of scale far outside their capacity .
[non-native] if we compare the number of the cars present 20 years ago and the cars present now we can see that the number of cars have deen increased , wide variety of cars are now pr4esent in the market and also the feature the the car should have is also improved a lot .
[non-native] even their new project does not work out , they will not be hopeless because they already had their time and they think , in my opinion , that it will come back if they try harder contrary to someone who has never succeeded in something who will take less risks because , if he fails , he will loose everything .
[non-native] the community will never be improved or developed if there is no specialists , and cultures will not be formed if there is no specialists where every person is doing his job to form a beautiful culture finally at the end .i think its true that most of the young people in an age of 20 bi 21 enjoy there live more than wsome old people in an age of 70 bi 75 .
[native] from * the socialist revolution and the right of nations to self-determination * ; > victorious socialism must achieve complete democracy and , consequently , not only bring about the complete equality of nations , but also give effect to the right of oppressed nations to self-determination , i.e. , the right to free political secession .
[non-native] this is by far the preferred method as its intention is not to propagandize or sensationalize ( as would be the case of the first case ) , but to use language in a lyrically enticing form that catches the roll of a tongue or that particular inflection that might season a simple phrase to the point of perfection in the ear of the beholder .
[non-native] the number of cars globally seen will therefore strongly increase during the next 10 years and begin to decrease rapidly in the 2030s .young people nowadays do n't care much about helping their communities , because the do n't have the idea that is , it is imprortant to partcipate in the commuinity social serveses .
[non-native] but in stead of that if i try to understand the philosophical fundaments of the modern movement , the reasons of le corbusier that made him design a diferent kind of building ( never seem untill that year ) and explain the origins and reasons of this architecture i will surely explain to everybody , including mysefl the results of my investigation making not just remember it but know the who , when , and most important of al , the why .
[non-native] for instance , a friend of mine who has a kilo problem , began to use a material advertised as a ` losing calorie miracle in 3 months ' , it has been 6 months and she is not looking lose much more than only 1 kilo . ..
[non-native] i live in cairo , and i believe there will come a time when we will not find a place on ground to have another underground station and i ca n't even imagine where are they going to find space to build more bridges .
[non-native] for example , when you go to buenos aires , argentina , is better that you do it with a tourist agent , because they would take you to the most historical and representative places of the city and you will know their history and learn special information about them .
[native] they drove a toyota echo [ here is one for reference ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/toyota-echo-sedan.jpg ) and they had the back seats removed , extra long rails installed for the seats and double seat belt extenders , tons of empty chip bags and soda bottles ( 2l ) in the back seats .
[native] its in everything about the two , the scope of time and population the regimes took place in , the way in which the killings occurred , the intent of the killings , the targets of the killings , certainly you see the difference between gassing a six year old girl because she comes from a certain ethnic group and shooting a 40 year old man for dissenting against your authoritarian rule , both are horrible but one is certainly worse and of a different nature than the other in my eyes at least .
[non-native] but the line between success and failure is very thin and it always depends on your point of view whether someone is successful or not .i completely disagree with the statement that , most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
[non-native] next time i went with a tour guide and it was fabulous i knew the dynasity the culture and living of people and every detail of the emperor , how they lived and the way they ruled the kingdom , minute to minute detail was covered , which made the trip very fulfilling and informative .
[non-native] for me traveling in a group led by a tour guide is one of the worst and most unconfortable ways of traveling since i am an adventurer and in those kinds of trips it is difficult to get so much flexibility as i like .
[native] for what it 's worth , i used to only buy nokia phones , i prefer fiskars garden tools and buy them for their quality , and i 've collaborated with finnish scientists before , so there 's my investment in the finnish economy .
[native] ** there is scope to protect policy space by including specific exclusions and/or exceptions during negotiation of trade and investment agreements like the tppa , and by strengthening global health frameworks for nutrition to enable them to be used as reference during disputes in trade fora .
[native] - eurosceptics love to pretend that the commission is the whole eu because it is ( admittedly ) the least democratic institution , but the fact is that it can only draw up the first draft of any legislation and is completely powerless to pass laws itself .
[non-native] in many situations we can find a lot a trubles , but is necessary to work very hard with the clear goals in our life , for example to take this test it was for me a new risk in my life , and if this time i can get do it i am ; proud to make my best , i now next time is possible .
[non-native] in conclusions , i find that in every domain of life , one should always try new things and live new experience in order to enrich his life and be successful in it .although it is good to specialize in one subject , i agree with the opinion that people have to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
[non-native] when you get the ideas and concepts you can utilize it and it is easy to apply to various usages or purposes but when you only try to shovel short facts and knowledges into your brain it is highly probable for you to lose the grip of that knowlege and you wo n't retain it long enough to share it with your children or your students .yes i agree that young people do not get time helping their communities .
[native] if you say something inconvenient to the political rulers and the most wildest interpretation of incredibly open-ended and nebulous laws which are not well defined at all unlike the united states of america 's 1st amendment , you can essentially be held as a political prisoner .
[native] we could try make it so it 'd be too economically harmful for them to do anything to us , but that also goes both ways , which is not somewhere we want to be with russia being the way it is right now .
[non-native] to sum up , it is reasonable to conclude that young people have more opportunities than the old ones to enjoy life due to the advanced science and technology , improved economic level as well as some changed culture ideas .i partly inagreement with the statement .
[native] but lloyd george , the british pm , promised that a boundary commission would be set up and that it would be done so that we got most of the land back , which would force the rest of the north to agree to join the free state .
[native] you reply multiple times to a single post , you edit your posts after people have replied to them , you tell people to read books to understand one of your points instead of explaining it yourself , you bring up obscure references without indicating how they link to your point .
[native] granted , there 's a question as to how necessary that ability is , but take libya for example : it was an relatively minor air operation on europe 's doorstep , but france and the uk * still * relied on the us for fairly significant logistical support .
[non-native] the example is that one of my best friend who wants to be a successful medical doctor , he is eightteen years old and he has only one promblem that is facing him and this problem is haveing a good grade in toefl to be accepet in the university , even this is his only problem , he is not working and practicing to have the wanted grade .
[non-native] although some of the advertisements may represent products accurately , the marketing rules lead advertisers to make strong endeavors to represent the product as well as they can to attract the consumer , even if it is not the exact reality .this is a controversial topic since the conditions are different for different countries .
[non-native] in our world today , i think that someone has to be able to discuss or to understand the main academic subjects such as : computer science , business and communication , because i think that they ca n't be understand by someone separetly .
[native] his end goal was to build social democracy on the scandinavian model , `` a socialist beacon for all mankind . '' > at first it seemed that the west also wanted gorbachev to succeed in loosening up the soviet economy and transforming it into something close to sweden 's .
[native] the government has promoted the multicultural aspect of canada so much , that having a family that 's been in canada for generations , i do n't even know what that really means in terms of my identity in the context of the country as a whole going into the future ; i 'm pretty `` typical '' in that i like hockey , maple syrup , the outdoors , i 'm polite , etc.
[non-native] but of course i think that if i had a lot of money and a good job while i am young this will be the best option as i can enjoy travelling , playing soccer matches and practicing some risky activities as climbing mountains and diving .
[native] we had building inspectors and heritage site officials and all sorts in suits with big folders traipsing in and out of the dorm for two weeks , and legend has it , the ex boyfriend was fined $ 4000 ( whether this is true , and if so , whether he appealed it , i can not say ) .
[native] they do n't have the same support networks as locals do ( long standing family and friends , plus in most cases some wealth along with it ) so staying in these communities of people that share common experiences also becomes like an extended support network they can rely on further cementing the ghettoization .
[non-native] here the main aspect in understanding is moving into the deeper meaning of the idea or concept and understanding about the concept it will make the things easier when studied by understanding ideas and concept it will remain in brain for a long time than it is studied according to the studies it has been concluded that most of the students who understand the concept can remember for a long time than we study the facts by understanding the cocnept we can get knowledge about the topic in two ways one is the positive results and the other the negative results from the concept .
[native] there used to be an army base in one of the towns near me that had a decommissioned tank inside the entrance , and twice i was on a school trip when i was 6/7 and 11/12 ish to the place and we got to hold guns and all .
[native] there 's a long-promoted culture of apathy there the likes of which the world has rarely seen , coupled with a self-pitying view of their own history where they somehow think their country has * super * suffered more than anyone else you guys , for real .
[native] it 's normally the most sensitive part of the penis ( [ sorrells , 2007 ] ( http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1464-410x.2006.06685.x/abstract ) -- [ nsfw relevant diagram ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/sorrells.gif ) ) , and the majority of men with intact foreskin agree that it 's the best feeling part of the penis ( [ meislahn & taylor , 2004 ] ( http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4757-4011-0_3 ) ) .
[non-native] to travel with a tour guide is very important because the tour guide know enerything in the city and he knows where is the torist places and where is the shops , museums , restaurant , hotels and alot more things , for example if you travel to a city for the first time and you do n't know about it you wont know where to go and you do n't know where is the tourists places in the city for and where is the good restaurants and museums and it well take you alot of time to know it but if you go with a tour guide he well take to the interesting places in the city and he will explain for you every thing about the city but if you travel alone you wont know where is the inteseting places in the city and also when you go to a country that dont speak your languge who can you talk to the people who can you reed the sings with out the tour guide youin our current society , it is thought that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .
[native] the world is changing and the western world will not be the dominant economic force for much longer ; decisions made in washington , berlin , london , ottawa , canberra , and paris will no longer decide the fate of the global economy .
[non-native] all in all , we can not stop the time , and we should convince in our distiny and fait , we must imagine our selves as we can try to give our age his right in having the rest in the end of our life , and this will not prevent us to try to complete our lives in thinking about the history which we had lived from the young .in the past few decades cars have been the most useful vehicle in the world .
[non-native] so i do not know if young people enjoy life better than older people the only thing i know and i hope for is that everybody enjoys life as much as they can while they still can .a striking feature of the modern world is the explosive growth of information .
[non-native] afterall its not just about completing the task it about compleating it perfectlyit is quite true that the advertisement companies are all over the world today and making a great improvement by enabling the companies to increase the amount of the product they sell and consequently the profit they get .
[non-native] for example , you are a sudent whose major is electronic enginereen moreover you also know some contents about accounting or finance , in this case you have had potential power to own your business in the future because your knowledge is not limited by on specifialize .
[native] personally , i think te reo is an awesome language , it 's so uniquely nz , we got so many of our place names from it , it 's culturally relevant , it 's considered a valuable skill to speak te reo in many jobs ...
[non-native] imagine in mathematics course the student has to understand the idea of parrallellism and the teacher ca n't give a him a real fact or example about parallelism and how two parallel ligns could never meet or in physics he has to understand the concept of the light without giving him a fact how this concept works in reality and what about history course ?
[non-native] studing art , math , history or science allow to people to hav many kind of subjects in thir mind so they could begin many possible works in thir life , and it is a very inportant aspect that we consider for the future .
[non-native] without risk we can not do any thing great and we all people should do something new and find something new and contribute something to world .in a contemporary society , someone who is specialized in one specific subject is more competent , and is more needed than someone who has broad knowledge on general topics .
[native] take a stroll , have some beshoff 's fish and chips on the pier , and finish the night off in the bloody stream pub -- http://howthpathways.com/loopwalks.html - one touristy place that is worth going to is leo burdock 's chipper ( fish and chip shop ) .
[native] the point i was making before was that agriculture needs support now to maintain an educated and advanced workforce that can use modern agricultural practices , so that it does n't require substantial training , education and capital to be recreated in the future when it is economically viable .
[non-native] lastly , learning facts can you learn the communication ability , because when you learn the facts , you probably need to know more details about the facts and you can disscuse and improve that you said it is correct , so you need to explain you ideas to let other peoples know , it good for you to communicate and let you to be a welcome one to them .
[non-native] i think that , besides the decrease in the use of cars in the next two decades , there will be an expand of individuality and a loss of humanity .with the development of society , there are increasing choices to enjoy life as people can play computer games , chat on line , or go to see a live performance etc .
[native] this was something that was repeated by both sides ; a trail of a new , experimental weapon works better than expected , but by the time they 're able to deploy it in force , countermeasures are available and it does n't work nearly as well .
[non-native] indeed , in countries such as india , people ca n't afford a car for every members of a family yet , like it is the case in the united states , but in twenty years the state will be more developped and the citizens might have more money and thus might be able to buy more cars which stay a sort of myth of success .
[non-native] having a broad knowledge is some thing really great from some to get usd from it , it can be very help ful in some positions , for example some people are siting and talking about some field of studing , and they all have a knowledge about many academic subjects exepet one person whose now interested to have aother knowledge of what he have , what if these people opend a subject far from this person field or specific subject , what his position would be like , and what if some of these people askd him about some thing in the other field of his , after that , that person would think that he was wrong about stiking in one specific subject knowing all about it , from that stuiations people change their minds about what they have made .
[native] the tories have raised the amount unis are allowed to charge during this parliament but the initial transition in england and wales from free to priced education was passed by a labour government under blair and it only did so because he had enough scottish labour mps to tip the [ vote ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/west_lothian_question#background ) .
[non-native] in conclusion , with these noticeable benefits of travelling in a group by a tour guide shown above , i strongly believe that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .i strongly agree with this statement that there were very few cars in use twenty years before when compare to today .
[native] i will win if the situation described in the [ resilient societies nrc petition ] ( https://www.nirs.org/reactorwatch/natureandnukes/petrulemaking262011.pdf ) and the greater problem illustrated by fukushima of meltdowns occurring in light water reactors when power is lost for any extended period , is true ... is at its core fundamentally true .
[native] pro-putin americans include : conspiratards who are on the pseudo-left , liberal-left do-gooders who hate us imperialism ( more neutral than pro ) , the for-real stalinist left , some libertarians ( counterpart to liberal-left who also rightfully dislike us interventionism , but who take it too far and believe russian propaganda ) , conservatives who are naturally inclined towards strongmen who attack `` the fags '' and who humiliate obama , neo-nazis , some right-wing jews ( russian jews in brooklyn , mostly ) , fundie muslims , and traditionalist catholics ( who have a whole end-times our lady of fatima thing about russia ) .
[native] the currency union would be best for iscotland and ruk only if you ignore the massive risks involved in underwriting another nations outsize financial sector when you have no control of the governance of such a sector , it also ignores the fact that salmond has declared iscotland would be a direct competitor to ruk .
[non-native] for this reason , i think that everyone should have a global point of view about what is around him , and that a broad knowledge is better than a specialization on a limited , specific subject .there is a prediction that car usage will decline in the future for several reasons .
[non-native] for example , you are playing a game and you reached to the 15th level , that is a success for the first time and your are successful for that instant but if you continue the game and could not go beyond 15th level then you are not successful anymore .
[non-native] finally , i think that what young people is saying about not having enough time to give for their nations is nonsense , because the time is always here but the will and care are not here .from the intotality i would like to cite and support it to my position stating young people enjoy life more than oolder people do .
[non-native] when i go to the larger shopping center i do n't never find to parchege , when i go to the big city i become crazy because the city has became the jungle , i always find queue and the traffic will be always more chaotic .
[non-native] its hard to fail and believe that we have not succeded , we are forced to believe that because we failed some prototype imprinted to us by someone or something , but if we are really whole and concient people , we will see that to fail to ourselves is the only way to fail in life .
[non-native] taking risks and doing something new are the only ways the became a better person in our lives .media in our middle east region and a round the world always speaking about a very hot topic which is come from time to time , this topic is `` the role of young people in supporting their communities '' , i think i am disagree with most of the statement which told that young people nowadays do not give the time to help their communities and i have tow resons for disagree with this statement .
[non-native] we have notce that after the foundiation of the international orgnization in many aspects such as , political , health and social the quality of life has been improved secound it improve sentific movment since it has bult on the base of ideas and knowled finally it is protection of the waild redical ideas which control the socites if there is no fair jujment in my opinion facts will be result of what we belive onpersonally , i think that it is very important for students learning ideas and concepts .
[native] it is indirectly dehumanising people because they protest against a ` fascist-enemy ' persona , and anybody who * says * something that resembles said persona , gets treated as if they 're actually an enemy ; a 'cause r of racial-motivated violence ' .
[non-native] yet have also observed other young people self involved in their day to day life not helping their community either because they do not care or they simply do not have the time as they have other priorities ( play with their friends , go to camp , etc . ) .
[non-native] so if one would like to buy the product only seeing the advertisements , i would like to say the one , ` do not believe most advertisements but be wise and smart consumer ' .advertisements is a important part in selling products and a good advertisements will bring benefits .
[non-native] for instance , when i was a high school student , in order to pass entrance examination to a university , i used to tackle with numbers because i had to memorize years of the particular events happened in a history class without understanding ideas and concepts about why the particular event was caused as a result something preceeding events .
[non-native] from deferring a year before college or graduate school in order to travel and volunteer for social organisations to choosing to work with non profit organisations for their internships , young people are increasingly becomming aware of the ways in which they could help not only their communities but reach out to people across the borders and seas .
[native] first , that post was written specifically about the tpp , and i just copy pasted it for a person who had asked why it was secret , with the caveat at the top that it 's about the tpp ( specifically about us industry trade advisory committees at the end there ) .
[native] it really is a catch 22 for the germans but i feel only 3 countries have the capacity to take on a leadership role and of the 3 germany would be the best because it bridges a gap between west and east and is also the most economically powerful .
[native] reading comments about this here on / r/python and elsewhere , wow , absolutely shocking ... honestly if reddit is in any way representative of the culture in america , i feel extremely sorry for women who have to tolerate such insanity in real life .
[native] i 'm not disagreeing with you that the greek banks had other alternatives ( and we 'll never know how much more insolvent they would be if they 'd stayed open ) , i do n't find it very helpful in debate to dismiss stergthmmy 's argument on the basis of this kind of technical reasoning .
[native] the british forces initially seemed to have no bias , and the majority of catholics were happy to have them there , however this changed when the then prime minister of northern ireland brian faulkner ( an ulster unionist ) had the army brought under ruc control .
[native] my second attempt ( the one i photographed ) , used simple syrup for the bottom layer , everglades espresso and simple syrup at about a 70 / 30 mix for the middle layer , and vok blue curacao and vodka at a 40 / 60 ratio for the top .
[native] soft power is awesome and nobody wants to see conflict but the fact of the matter is that mankind has been fighting and killing each other since we first started walking this planet and recent events do not make me think this is going to change anytime soon if ever .
[non-native] so we have to own out our resposabilities and never give up in front of unforeseeable hindrances , instead we can change our outlook and we can share our sparetime with young people in order to focus togehter on the big opportunity we have to help our communities .students can learn facts , but not necessarily understand them .
[native] from wikipedia : si vis pacem , para bellum is a latin adage translated as , `` if you want peace , prepare for war '' ( usually interpreted as meaning peace through strength -- a strong society being less likely to be attacked by enemies ) .
[native] first , this guy in the video ( who 's probably not studied ir ) says that only in late 2012 did putin `` shift political strategies '' ( whatever that 's supposed to mean ) from `` economic growth to anti-western paranoia , conservative christian orthodoxy , and a russian imperial revival of nationalism '' .
[native] i do n't remember nato forces generating mass graves of civilians which they try to hide instead of publishing number of civilian deaths , parading pows and washing streets afterwards , performing mock executions and putting them online , denying ( keyword ) that they shot down a civilian airliner and then fabricating stories that the enemy did it , making ground incursions into nations and then denying that this is occurring , annexing territory of sovereign nations .
[native] but troika measures did n't focus on any of that , they focused on slashing pensions , increasing vat on essentials , fire-sale privatisations and later on in the game basically making greece dance to show `` who is boss , and let that be a lesson to the rest of you lefties '' .
[non-native] finally , i would say that students should understand concepts and ideas and learn facts becouse no one knows what will happen after days , years or century becouse life is progressinf and science is devolopingwith the recent rapid economic development , the pace of life is becoming faster and faster .
[non-native] she has also contributed so much to the society by building many santoriums and homes for the poor and old aged people .although there is alittle time for young people , because of the high amount of reponsiblities , works , and maybe we can say schools ( if they were not graduated ) any one can order his time and hime self to get the benefits by doing alot of thing in ashort time like studying , working , and helpeng their communitien or famillies , but with out ordering time the person will lose the ability of working well , the person will not have time that he can not do any more works .
[non-native] since he needs , at this time of period , the solid specific subject knowledge to prospell , even accelarate his reasearch in certanin academic field , rather than staying in the phase of exposing to a broad range of knowledge as much as possible .cars are an effective and convinient means of transport that can be owned by the individual person .
[native] one in which moving large numbers of troops , some possibly from another continent , with the heavy metal like mbt 's , ifv 's , artillery , food , fuel and ammunition for all of the above , getting them dug in and set up , does n't happen overnight .
[native] of course we have , every single person in the entire eu has , for decades , being calling for a world where the soviet union is super strong and america is put in its place because we really care that much about hating the evil empire etc.
[non-native] in this context context there can be numerous examples that can be stated among which i would like to state two which are as follows : firstly , in the case of a doctor , one can not go to a general physician for a heart problem .
[native] it is equally undeniable that the old regime was a hierarchical feudal serfdom with china improving quality of life considerably for them over the years with the area far more developed than neighboring nepal and also undeniable that china 's take over was based only on imperialist agenda with no heed of the democratic consent of the tibetans since .
[non-native] and finally travelling with a group of people it is a very fun thing to do , because you can get to know a lot of them , it always happens that may be in the group there is the lady that nobody can not stands because of her behavoir , or may be there is the weird couple with their freek kid .
[non-native] yes , with such a working style you are working on a wide range of subjects , and you are continuously changing your study topic , and you know some of everything , and you seem to be successful with a lot of work fields you have , but you lack one , and a very important thing : experience .
[non-native] most of the times as a parent it is vey difficult to explain to your younger children why a certain brand of cereal is liked by so many children on telivision and when you bring it home everybody runs away from it after first tatsing session .
[native] it 's absolutely reasonable to use this in some sort of political context , but you have to admit that it 's being overused to the point when rotherham is n't merely the city where the event occurred but `` rotherham '' itself is the event .
[native] not exactly true , your channel could be horribly insecure but you can simply encrypt the messages ( not that most people are remotely competent enough to not use crypto in a way that completely does n't work ) , and then constantly occupy the channel while not in use .
[non-native] for exmaple , if we look into our everyday lives , we can see that most millionares and billionares are the people who have actually tried something in thier lives and the people with normal wages are the people who are working for them .
[native] we 're having a big ukrainian-themed dinner tonight , just for fun ( and because it 's a good excuse to chow down on one of canada 's favourite foods : perogies ) , per the association between easter and ukrainian easter eggs ( yeah i know about faberge , but ukrainian eggs are [ kind of a big deal here in canada ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/vegreville_pysanka_august_2008.jpg ) .
[non-native] with people getting busier by the day and chances of buying a car increasing , and speed becoming such a vital thing , i believe that in the next twenty years cars will not only not decrease , but they will increase and the numbers of cars will sore .i agree with this statement for many resons .
[non-native] in moderen countrys such as japan they still use cara even they have new modren metroos and transption > aslo yung guyts like to putt it in accation mostly so they like to drive not driven or buy using some sort of new teghnalge that do n't have .
[native] i do n't understand politics at all , but my mum has been to a part of indonesia not far away from bandung ( i 'm not sure where ) and reports being warned not to talk to the police at all , me ( as a pre-school age child - i have a * vague * memory of this , actually , though i did n't know at the time ) finding drugs on the beach , and her being in a taxi that got pulled over and the driver arrested at gunpoint with more police pointing guns at my mum .
[non-native] the debate taking place about climate change and the convincing arguments scholars are giving us for the fact that , if we go on emissing such large ammounts of co2 , we are going to face a serious climate catastrophe , shows that we are forced to think of alternatives to the nowadays used cars .
[non-native] of course , when people get older , they have more and more responsabilities , and it becomes harder for them to free themselve , to spare time for their leisure if they are working , and , if they are retired , they probably do not wish to enjoy life in the same way as young people do .
[non-native] thus all these aspects not only require the support of the older population but must include the younger generation too since these young minds are considered to be tomorrow 's future in pure terms thus forming an example fr he future generations to come by influencing them by inculcating values like unity and culture and tradition of the community by leading to the better progress of the community thus i feel that today younger people must be encourged to spend atleast sometime with their community from their busy lives which is not only important for the moment but also for a better tomorrow and for a good and bright future of the community as well as the world thus making the world a better place to live in .yes , i definitely agree with this statement that young people nowadays dont give enough time to helping their communities .
[non-native] also , the energy supplies that are needed to run conventional automobiles are getting lesser everyday , unless a new energy source will be found , which will also have to be very cheap , driving a car will become much more expensive than today .
[native] of course most of these issues have died out and the last of the mongoloids have been shunned to the furthest recesses of civilization ( they exist but they mostly just exist as outlandish callers on radio shows and are honestly mostly harmless at this point ) but the issues that formed some of the violent and negative reputation the south got were mostly due to how the end of the us civil war was handled .
[non-native] to summarize , my opinion is that older people enjoy life more than young people , not only because of the oportunities that life present to them , but mainly because of the way they see life .it is true : youngsters do not care much about their communities or at least a fewer part of them do it with respect to elder generations .
[native] then explain why `` amd optimized '' games run better and on everything , and scale better , while `` nvidia optimized '' games have often generally poor optimization , which does n't get better over time , with some exclusive licensed crap added to it .
[non-native] my mainpoint is that it would be to much work to do when you want to have knowledge in all academic subjects , especially for me . ..there are a lot of people that think that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , but in my opinion it is better to specialize in one .
[native] under the un convention on refugees , if any of them get to italian , or spanish , or whatever soil and claim asylum , by ** law ** they are allowed to stay until their asylum claim is processed , so immediate deportation is both illegal , and immoral .
[native] so you 've paid back your 10 % bond back ( let 's say 10000 euro at 10 % - the interest is paid back periodically ) , but to pay back the principal you take a new loan ( 10000 euro at 3 % ) .
[native] that political crisis probably would have been very much larger had the uk also been in the eurozone , given the size of its own crisis and its often different outlook - theoretically , strong uk leadership could have made the political crisis less severe , but , eh , cameron , so no .
[native] they even attempted to claim a field used ( as in , in * current * use ) for cattle as their own because of some longstanding agreement they had apparently had with the field 's previous owner and began to dig foundations in the middle of it for a huge mansion .
[non-native] in conclusion , i guess it is really difficult sometimes to resist to the power of advertisements , but everybody should try to be a mature consumer , aware of the risks of not considering all the aspects related to our consumistic behaviour , as advertisement tries to make only money . .do people nowaday give enogh time to help their comunities ?
[native] > is someone using their typical we-no-idea-what-these-words-mean lingo like `` toxic '' ( thanks , riot ... ) , `` problematic '' , `` poisonous '' , `` misogynist '' , `` sexist '' , `` trigger '' ( sorry kiddies , you are n't ptsd sufferers ) or any of the other ones ?
[non-native] i did a professinal education as a media designer and now i am studying media sciences , political sciences and cultural sciences , and therefore i can tell from my own experience , that it is very important today , to have knowledge of a variety of topics .
[non-native] the both are hardly linked in my experience working only in an abstract way using combination of concepts to explain something would be , at first , very hard to understand because at the first concept you do n't understand you would be lost and furthermore you may not remember what you ' ve been listening for hours long .
[non-native] obviously , everyone should know when some important events ( such as the world wars , the american or french revolutions ) have happened but what we really have to care about is why they happened and what kind of consequences they have had for us .
[native] he may not be as big of a fucking clown as the guy in op , but it 's sadder because more people voted for him and he 's far more serious about it - when he bothers to show up in a suit .
[native] my visits to a dietitian are more about working through anxiety and identifying why i do n't eat when i should ( which leads to binging ) and identifying the little progresses i make so i do n't slide downhill back to bad habits .
[non-native] i believe this because advertising a product is n't usually about how good they are and what qualities it brings with it.a product needs to be sold and that 's why companies need to advertise in a positive way about it in order to sell the product .
[native] we have 10 + different german carts and [ our local best bratwurst ] ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/altengartz-portland ) is better than anything i had in germany since i first visited in 1992 , and i know it sounds gay but i fucking love a good sausage in my mouth .
[non-native] one of the papular movement called ` six sigma ' was thought to be a perfact solution of the future market , but it became a cause of less inovation of company because it based on a particular fact in the short time period and ignored lots of key concepts in business principles .
[native] i 'm in favor of banning an athlete whose nation has engaged in systemic doping and circumvention , since it 's very probable the athlete has benefited from this and has n't been caught yet , and furthermore , it 's important to discourage such actions on behalf of nations in the future .
[non-native] to sum up i want to ask a question ; living is risk by its own why to take more risks ?today , a growing number of people that led by a tour guide , when they have a travel to the other nation .
[non-native] see todyay if you are specialized in your field then you have a better chance of making to the top in this field and you cant earn a lot of fame and recognition in that field and you can also become a dr in that fields but incase of trying to know a lot of subjects would you might not be able to as good in either of the subjects .
[non-native] this is my experience but in conclusion i agree with this statemen : `` the best way to travel is travel that are accomplish with your motivations '' .i disagree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
[non-native] in the end peopel can change and young peopel also they just need some one to show them the way so they can help , like the teashers in school or advertysment in the different media like tv , news paper , radio , this will help them yo understand that their is other thing need them and that is not every thing for the money .in now day , many students learn things by memorize but not getting the main ideas .
[non-native] in fact , only few people having the experience about new things and risk can be possible to know the skill , like as `` how to do this dangerous position '' , `` how to manage some risk '' as `` the statistic of the management ability in the dangerous environment . ''
[non-native] though , there are a few advantages of a group travel , i prefer to travel alone as it offers the flexibility which is of foremost importance to me .in general it is better to have a broad knowledge of many subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
[non-native] and may be in future they might advertise it genunely ( the way it is ) , but as of now my option is that i agree that most of the advertisments make products seem much better than they really are .it is often better to have a wider perception of many academic subjects rather than confining oneself to a specialisation in a particular subject .
[non-native] i am a person who always keep a heart of curious , i want to know every thing around me , why the birds fly , why machines work , i ask and ask , my friends give the answers , i think they are mr.know-all .
[non-native] with proper motivation from the older generation this can be changed as was the case in my community when we in first moved to the community where i live now there was no proper waste disposal , people would just trow there waste in front of their neighbours house are on the roads which intern affected them with fly and mosqutioes .
[non-native] another reason , i support this statement is young people are full of sprits as they have not seen the hardships of life and they have the companion or a partner to enjoy with them , on the other hand , old people have seen many problems and they usually stay alone as their partner are not with them or their children are far away .
[non-native] i know that it wo n't be easy to reduce the number of cars , but i think it is a task to be done in order to keep the world a clean place and i am sure that it will be done !a community needs the help of every members to be a nice and pleasant place to live in .
[native] the uk would help if poland or the baltic states were attacked because it is firmly bound under no uncertain terms to do so , as would every single nato ally including the us , france , germany , canada , greece , norway , netherlands , spain , italy , czech republic , turkey , etc.
[non-native] it is possible to argue that in general , the pleasures of the young are more simple and pure as they tend to be carefree , with little responsibility , especially when compared to older people who probably have jobs to go to every morning and a family to support .
[non-native] if einstein had not paid specific attention to his specialization subject of physics , there would have been no development because all human creations of this date are based on his many thoeries like three laws of motion , theory of relativity , quantum physics etc .
[non-native] another reason for my favouring of learning facts as against understanding of ideas and concepts would be that by only learning ideas and concepts of any subject the student would not be successfull in his life or career because without any practical experience or going through with facts he can not able to show his talent or performance on the field or practise area .
[native] perhaps you 're forgetting the part where i specifically stated that i was fine with it since it would open up the debate about how we want democracy to function and would allow for the use of new technologies and ideas in the democratic process .
[non-native] because of all those benefits of travelling in a group led by a tour guide , i believe it is the best way for me to travel .everyone lives in a communty that consists of peoples , in which , all the people , old and young , are supposed to join the community activities , and to help their community in many of aspects .
[non-native] but not all the studies could be related with facts or we have facts with it , so ideas & concepts will be the major for those studies , in astronomy it 's hard to see everything about those away planets or stars from the earth but the ideas & concepts could work to explain things it 's maybe impossible to have facts about but it 'll not be as clear as facts but it 'll do the work .
[native] and you could also object that this is a `` group of people '' , but i 'd say ( although i hate to say it ) that everyone has to see how `` foreigners '' is a little bit more general , broader word than lgb .
[non-native] in my opinion the use of the car are more confortable that the use of pubblic transport , for istance , when i go to my university it is better for my to go with my car because i have a parking near my college , if i go with the bus or walking with my feet the time to arrive to my campus will be more than if i go with my car .
[non-native] you get to communicate with the local people , maybe try speaking a foreign language , find out what is considered a good food in the place and how to use the public transportation , and line up in the restaurant and eat , learning the `` local '' way of doing things .
[non-native] young people , for example go to pubs , disco , enjoy the night lifeof the city , can ride on a motorcycle through out the city while old people cant even imagine do that , they just sit at home and enjoy the tv .
