[native] of course the civil war was a rich mans war .
[native] you can deduce that : the loudest people are the latter .
[non-native] i think there are a lot of products which are in fact not as useful or of the quality the commercial lets them look like .
[non-native] after all , i agree with the statement that advertisements make product seem more attracted .
[non-native] so there should be something which has impact or words that are very interesting .
[non-native] as i understand old people tell young people to enjoy their life because they think that school is not too hard and there is no illness .
[native] i was actually suggesting that the less wealthier states set up factories and r&d facilities to attract companies from other states .
[native] they 've fought side by side with the americans for the past decade - we do n't forget that sort of thing .
[non-native] the government give a possibility to use an other instrumen for travele , there is an airplain for the long long travel , there is a train for a long travel or bus for short travel , but the moder people prefore using a car , why ?
[non-native] the younger people is , the quicker he/she moves .
[non-native] you fear the ultimate truth ie death approachinhg towards you with a lot of thing which are still pending .
[native] like i said ... sovereignty is important . ~ ~
[native] i 'm not sure whether or not you know what `` unit labour cost '' means , but if not , that might be the first place to start .
[non-native] he is generally percieved to be a master in his field .
[non-native] so , i think that it is really important to understand ideas and concepts .
[non-native] but if u try to be unhappy u can do this it is very easy .
[non-native] because people will arrive to their destination faster , less frustrated .
[non-native] successful people are unique and risques are always part of thier life .
[native] it 's events like this which make me glad for the `` what happened in your country this week '' series .
[native] but as that older generation dies out and are replaced by the catholics of habit ( as opposed to their catholics of conviction forbearers ) their kids will see no need to pretend anymore .
[native] it would mean that sinn fÃ©in ( who 're highest in the polls at the minute ) would be the largest party and if they got in they would literally ruin the country ( their leadership is composed of uneducated former terrorists ) and they 'd probably stir shite in northern ireland again .
[non-native] at that age they need help aproximatly as the child need .
[native] what 's the most comparable us plane to this .
[native] as long as they have nukes this will continue .
[native] it goes well with his character on the show .
[native] i 've seen this guy in action on other subs .
[non-native] therefore , i think it is a natural sequence that advertisements try to make prtoducts seem better as much as possible .
[non-native] its really a good thing for a student to get the main ideas of a particular topic .
[native] and you can pretend this is just semantics all you want , that the guy really meant the same thing either way .
[non-native] but the old people - the more wiser and the more matured , those who have seen what life is all about - have a different and a more fulfilling way of enjoyment .
[native] it 's not spreading throughout europe or north america , it 's spreading through west africa , where black people come from , it 's not any type of racism just really logic .
[non-native] i belive that there are to different mobilities : the personal and the economical mobility .
[native] imelda marcos bought one , and in the process became a tongan citizen .
[native] the will to rebuild managed to give the historic centre a new life .
[non-native] so , actually advertisements are not better than real product .
[native] and stop editing your posts after i reply to them you dishonest gnat .
[native] many people are still baptized and will attend church for christmas and funerals .
[native] well , i find i generally like pilsners and lagers .
[non-native] i think , in mordern world one should be specific towards the subject , because there is a limitation for human beings .
[non-native] if someone has a talent and does it well , then there arent many reasons for the person to fail except , of course , the skill or talent is dormant and of no use .
[native] you asked me to define the discrimination , i felt the easiest way to do that was through an example to show you how this discrimination happens .
[non-native] someone who always try new things is not sure to succed in all this things .
[non-native] i 'm sure there will be alot of poeple who would drive that kind of car .
[native] `` it 's not my fault i 'm being overly reactionary .
[native] we have a lot of jews here in canada ( they make up nearly 5 % of the population of my city ) and i can attest that at least here , israel 's actions are highly divisive amongst the jewish population .
[native] i do n't know much slavic languages , but it is true that bulgarian grammar is highly divergent .
[non-native] they made everyone believe the stories told by some different people who , acording to them used the product and had amazing results in a limited number of days .
[native] uh , are you seriously comparing sex between adults to sex with children ?
[non-native] during the last years more and more people are aware that the use of cars contribute highly to the pollution .
[native] it 's why nasheed 's and other religious songs are all vocal .
[non-native] according to the reporter lastly , he still the most rich guy in the world .
[non-native] this is true particularly as many of them strive to fit in by wearing the right clothes and using the right terms .
[native] and trying to paint a moral western europe with its track record is laughable and very hypocritical .
[non-native] since we already know that most of products are commercialized and exaggurated in a better and good way by the advertisement , we could avoid buying any fake or bad products .
[non-native] for this reason people learn their past and their history .
[native] i asked my hungarian so parents and they said the biggest difference was that there was ques for everything .
[non-native] they are embedded in their normal day situation which often only consists of business and family .
[non-native] third , i have experienced many times that i thought advertisment has tricked me .
[native] now i live way up north in ontario , and not a single one to be found .
[non-native] they are an evidence of economic power and they provide independence , a feeling of freedom .
[native] look at the fact that matthew rimmer [ is taking approximately the same positions ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-opnhrbnme ) as i have been on isds , * and he 's being consulted as an expert by your government * .
[native] if you 're going to call serbia srbija , could you be consistent and call all the other countries by their native language names .
[native] in return for the big marginal profits , however , the network costs a shittonne to deploy and upgrade repeatedly .
[native] > there 's no point in trying to have a rational discussion with someone who calls you so many vile things and threatens you for an opinion .
[native] i will say this when i turn on my canadian news channels , i do not have to hear about all the gun violence that took place in canada , those news stories only come from the usa and seem to have way to often .
[non-native] i was free to stop by a comestic shop whenever i felt like it .
[native] that is because canada has not been a province of another nation ( s ) for a thousand years .
[native] i 'm convinced some of them would have been great even off drugs .
[non-native] in spite of the fact that it is more important and preferable choice to learn the facts instead of learning same ideas and concepts all the time , it is necessary for students to be successful in their class , and also many teachers do n't open new facts in the world .
[native] anyways it sounds like you 're trying to make this a competition and say that the us is more racist than europe towards roma which makes me laugh .
[native] when i logged in from denmark or sweden i was subscribed , plus a smattering of danish or swedish subreddits .
[native] 1 ) crimeans were barely involved in leaving ukraine .
[native] i 'm learning what i can now , then in about a year i move over .
[non-native] with cars we can also have more convinent features we can also listen music by playing audio in our car it makes our drive more interesting .
[native] > that law was n't what you claim it to be .
[non-native] etc but today even people such as artisans , computer enigeers , pilots , artists to name a few are doing incredibly well since recent societies demand diversity and if you choose a profession which is likely to become a hit with society then you know that your risk or gamble paid off since you will be successful .with the rapid growth of our civilization , more and more people start paying attentions to enjoy their lives .
[non-native] they not only advertise their products and their name .
[non-native] imagine that you are in class , being taught about history .
[non-native] first of all , i think that people 's awareness on protecting the environment is improving .
[native] on certain subjects , wikipedia is an * extremely * biased source of information .
[non-native] so men has to think to a possible solution , for example electrical cars or other means of transport to substitute cars .
[native] 90 % of americans wo n't know what a roma is until you tell them gypsies and then they would say `` oh like from borrat or the holocaust ?
[non-native] to stay on the main idea and learn the facts or understand the idea , consepts and be able to demonstarate your ideas ?
[native] eh , i 'm just explaining the rationale , i do n't know enough about it to definitively say it 's the better option .
[non-native] another thing about advertisements is that , than to spend money in producing an attractive advertisement , companies should invest more on improving the quality of product that they are producing .
[non-native] therefore , my agreement with the statement about travel in a group is the best , should not influence the opinion of people who want to join me in the trip .i agree that the majority of advertisements do make products seem much better than they really are .
[native] what we do have is sympathy for a state with a bully neighbour ... let me clarify my support of palestine , i think hamas are scum and guilty of everything israel has said they do .
[native] calculating the geographical centre can be done in many different ways , depending on if you include all the small outer islands in the far north and in the atlantic , where the line dividing europe from asia is drawn in russia , etc.
[non-native] for example my position in my current project is quite secure although many lay-offs are going on since there is not anyone to replace me .
[non-native] all this is being done due to a change in thinking and a new approach of wider horizons and not a mental block that one should be efficient only in his or her related field of work .
[non-native] in the past , for me , most situation was very different , because probably in the past there were a lot of questions , there were another problems .
[native] you can decide for yourself if it 's an abrasive opinion .
[native] [ report here for those that would like to check for themselves ] ( http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2013/march/tradoc_150737.pdf ) .
[native] if the wife/husband could n't get a job in whatever podunk town we dropped them in , the soldier financially struggled , stole shit , and then quit on our ass .
[native] i 've a very strong feeling when it comes down to it , when/if there is a referendum the uk population will vote to stay in the eu .
[non-native] by using this type of cars their many advantages like as we disscused the faster mode of transportation , which not only improves ones only status but improves the whole economic development of the country .
[native] i 'm learning french at school ( in my last year ) and i 'm looking to learn spanish and/or german soon after , because i 'm looking to spend time living in some of those countries when i 'm older ( i 'm an irish citizen ) .
[non-native] after graduating school students have a job and work to do for their life .
[non-native] the youth now are more interested in community work then ever before .
[non-native] are things that maybe at the beginig it doesnt put attention but at the end would be very an important thing to him .
[non-native] even though his experience made him as his dream strong and deterministic .
[non-native] because they know that if you want to make customer satisfied , you need to take risk and try to find new things for them .
[native] should probably repaint it as it 's currently a huge russian flag .
[non-native] it is a fast way of transportation , but cars increase day by day which also increases the pollution and the park problem in modern cities .
[non-native] furthermore , knowing many subjects , we can apply one thing to another .
[native] special lanes targeting any particular group are just not gon na work .
[native] humans have been smoking for thousands of years , many of histories greatest men smoked well into their old age .
[non-native] for this many ways had been organised by us and one of the most important way to do this work is to attain excellence in science , research , arts and technology .
[non-native] and what the results were made after these war or great events ?
[native] its the so called `` race to the bottom '' .
[non-native] peadvertisements are everywhere : in the streets , at work , at home on tv and on the radio .
[native] he 's an unprincipled opportunist , so he 'll choose the latter .
[non-native] if one has to travel from one place to another , everytime he can not afford to go by aeroplane , trains , when he is having the cheaper means of transport .
[non-native] me myself i 'm a very lazy person and i would preffer if we do n't study academic subjects , but if you think about it for a few seconds and imagine how you 're life would be you will imaditely change you mind , because there wo n't be anything to complain on and life would be useless .i believe that facts can be learned in many different ways and that school has a different object than teaching students facts .
[native] most definitely not but thats what happen in ulster albeit in reverse but you get the picture .
[native] i do n't know what she said exactly but he was wrong to call her that .
[native] the us navy is hanging onto the growler even after the f-35 acquisition because the growler has a wider range of electronic jamming options , something that would be good to have around in the defense of finland .
[non-native] so , with the increase of the percapita income of the individual the sale of the cars areb also increasing and also the increase of population increases the growth sales of cars which are basic means of transport in the form of taxis , cabs e.t.c .
[native] interesting submission , and not only because it largely aligns with my view .
[non-native] on the other hand , this could be a reason for older people to enjoy life more actively and intensively , since they feel that they will not life forever .
[non-native] but this year i wanted to change something in my life , so in september i decided to get in an organisation that helps old people .
[non-native] if they sell a product that way they lose their credibility and that is way to bad .
[non-native] so , if a students recivied an idea or a concept without having the solid basics , he wil not be able to make his decision about it .
[non-native] people are almost all fooled if they believed in the facts in which they does n't have enough understanding ideas and concepts .
[native] socialist party , socialist workers party , and sinn fÃ©in have been winning a lot quite recently , and at the expense of government parties , though the government was successful at squeezing the radicals out of european parliament ( mostly due to people before profit alliance running against the socialist party in the same constituency , which was considered an incredibly sectarian move ) .
[non-native] second , i think my choice is better because of lack of problem solving ability .
[native] what i mean is , you are n't being sold a resource , you 're being sold the service of having it brought to your premises .
[native] whenever they 're in a slump , the eastern states ( where most of the real cities , like melbourne , canberra , and brisbane lie ) support them .
[native] the west is more critical of israel than it is of far more oppressive regimes ( china , sudan , saudi arabia , qatar , uae , etc. )
[native] that is the whole point of a nuclear weapon .
[non-native] later , work tensions builts up stressing in all aspects .
[native] my city has a large somali community , as well as lots of people from pakistan .
[non-native] but if you look at people such as the dalay lama , you can hardly be afraid of getting old .
[native] the ottomans were stopped at the gates of vienna by a unified force of european kingdoms .
[native] what if barroso and juncker are actually ukip plants ?
[non-native] improving knowledges is not the only way to be admitted among successful people .
[non-native] i have some important reasons to think like that .
[non-native] what kind of a cake makes a girl kiss a boy .
[non-native] wheras if try to gain knowledge on all academic subjects no one can say what you are , i mean whether you are mathematicin or an engineer or an doctor .
[native] i did n't realize `` i ca n't feel my face '' was about cocaine addiction .
[native] maybe we like the euro more than everyone else .
[non-native] the new technology develop to overcome this problem will result in new types of machines , which can be similar to cars , but will be no longer the traditional cars .
[native] first , i 'm not a ` ttip cheerleader ' .
[non-native] my mother always used to complin this creepy sensation in her legs which would keep her from sleeping at night , we did everything even went to the doctor but he also could not help her much , till the time i saw this advertisement on the tv for restless leg syndrome and a specific medicine for curing it .
[native] any problem you can think of there is a solution that involves relying on a foreign system .
[native] the us economy is in decline , and to be bound to it is to go down with the sinking ship .
[native] i 'm not even sure how you got to that from what i said .
[non-native] so i disagree the statement mainly because of the following reasons , by reading many subjects a person might get a broad knowledge but he can not implement that knowledge perfectly because of imperfection in those particular subjects .
[non-native] i hope young people can understand that point of view , and contribute their time to their communities , and then make their communities much better .the statement at hand expresses a strongly generalized opinion on a nowadays very fervent issue .
[native] especially since what you were wrong about the choice being between german or uk multinationals .
[non-native] also , i tried to communicate with chinese people with chinese to find some famous places , to buy gifts and to eat traditional foods .
[non-native] the food , that we watch on tv , is more better than they really are .
[native] personally i quite like having a polish delacatessen around the corner , and the biggest culture clashes come from immigrants from outside europe .
[non-native] if they do not do this , their funs can loose their interest to them .
[non-native] most of all , even though students know facts , if they ca n't understand them , they ca n't use their knowledge .
[native] i thought you would be happy for la vrai langue to be promoted ?
[non-native] although i acknowledge the generous contribution of some young people in helping their community , i agree with the statement that `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities '' .
[native] its only being reported on by a bullshit tabloid paper though
[native] the uk would no longer have such a massive influence on europe at that point though .
[non-native] however with this planned trip , there would be no time for spending time by without doing anything .
[non-native] on the other hand , older people see much more risks in freedom .
[non-native] most people say that they need a car to be flexible and have the controlle over their personal timetabel where they can decide where they want to be at any time .
[native] / s the prevalence of `` lukashenko '' over `` lukashenka '' does show how russified belarus is though .
[non-native] many companies they made many dm and adertisments to attract their coutomers .
[native] its part of a global race to the bottom .
[non-native] they do not shy away from exploiting the resources of their community to climb up the ladder of their own success .
[non-native] and then they can get the reward from hard work .
[native] when push comes to shove smokers are filthy fucks .
[native] it employs a model of taxing some things incredibly heavily , and not taxing other things at all .
[native] today there was a massive discussion about the tpp in / r/worldnews , why did n't you go there ?
[native] they should be put in place because they are * good * laws , effective laws , that do n't contravene rights and freedoms that people enjoy .
[non-native] in exams and quizzes their understanding will be assessed based on whether they have memorized the specific facts in addition to whether they can apply the equations introduced .
[non-native] i had a good chance that i could already know concept choosing art 's works .
[non-native] for example , a twenty year is certainly not dealing with the problem of near death or the challenge of raising a child .
[non-native] one specific reason that strikes me is that it can be said that young people can feel more interesting or can be more impressed than older people even about the same incident .
[non-native] so that the person can be proid of herself / himself .
[non-native] this situation can be seen at the same way for the developing countries in a few decades , therefore this can be a sign to support my disagree with the statement .
[non-native] thus it is helpful for every individual to have broad knowlege of all the subjects in order to get sucess in their life which will be helpful in order to shape there careers bright and good .i do disagree with the idea according to which young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their own communities .
[native] what we 've had here is a string of successes for the radical left and the populist left across council elections and by elections .
[non-native] they consider personal enjoyment more important than societal development .
[non-native] you would be majored in any of you 're favoured topics and the rest would only help finishing you 're credits and wasting time so you would n't get bored .
[native] there is an inevitable outcome to this if crossing into austria becomes more difficult for migrants and the traffickers .
[native] uk has a much better history of standing up to russia ( think 1980s ) than energy-dependent countries like germany and ee who do not fulfil their nato obligations of 2 % gdp military spending and instead rely on the anglosphere countries .
[native] that would be fine if everything was self contained , but its not .
[non-native] this gives him the offset of a `` jack of all trades '' .
[non-native] many old people have problems in their mucels and that made pain for them .
[native] you 're a nut , in the sense of most probably being mentally unstable , and you accusing me of using sock-puppets ( as if enough of my posts do n't get downvoted below zero regardless ) just displays your paranoia .
[native] even if just one isp does n't obey , people from other isps still get ( slower ) international access since the isps all have peering agreements with each other .
[non-native] first of all in a laboral enviroment people specialized in one specific subject are more likely to be hired , because they have a bigger knowledge about the job what are they going to do .
[non-native] it is then easily understandable that through all the main evolutions , such as the industrial revolution , or the internet , people who wanted to take risks had very high potential of being successful .
[non-native] he uses his car for many resons such as to go for work , to go out etc .
[native] it has the potential to be a very influential nation in the region * ( much more than now ) * and it being outside of the eurozone insulates it from the above to a degree .
[non-native] or else , i 'll waste most of my time , finding and reaching all the tourist spots on my own .
[non-native] some old people go in schools to tell their experiences thisis very important to the community .
[non-native] can be concluded , that the facts , and the ideas and concepts , are both very important to have a better knowlege about something , that when we see the concept , we also have to consider the facts that are behind .i agree with the statement .
[native] basically , if the us does it one way , and europe does it a different way , then the us is automatically wrong .
[native] insulting america is one thing but insulting democracy is retarded , fuck you .
[native] i 'm not happy with it , but i think it 's understandable .
[native] do they have a direction they want to take their economy , or is it simply trying to survive at this point ?
[native] there wont be much gravity so it will be very interesting what happens when those screws go out .
[native] in what actual way is canada more progressive and liberal than the uk ?
[native] even if it was consensual , which there is no evidence it was and plenty it was n't , she was 13 which makes it rape .
[non-native] also the decisions , once made , are known to level the number of exciting things to do , museums to visit , to a strict minimum .
[native] ` hey , one report quoted by bill clinton predicted jobs would rise and they did n't so obviously all reported about trade deals are lies ! '
[non-native] now they are 3 years that he enjoy working there .
[non-native] they spend most of their time to enjoy their own interest such as watching moves , shopping , or playing games .
[native] maybe that will happen eventually though , or maybe it will happen in another case , but at the moment it 's hard to claim that the uk is influencing other eu countries in any way at all .
[non-native] additionally , old people like life more than younger because they have many reasons to enjoy life .
[non-native] in this comptetive society , all the parents in the world intend to keep their children from danger .
[native] learning other languages is always easiest in the pub :) ` nech sa pÃ¡Äi ' is definitely what a shopkeeper would say in that context , it 's an unusual expression .
[native] people 's motivations for opposing the eu are varied .
[non-native] for example , bill gates a well recognized business man in the united states started off with a business idea in college , and instead of continuing his studies he took his idea and put it into action , he now is the owner of an internationally recognized computer software company microsoft .
[non-native] in addition to economical and social reasons in making the advertisement to show products much better than they are , the political reasons can be demonstrated as a proof .
[native] it would have stopped decades ago if you guys did n't half-arse it .
[non-native] also , we can meet many people who study other feilds , and speak to each other .
[non-native] second , i think that puclic translation is not convinient at country sides .
[non-native] furthermore , we call these `` academic subjects '' because they are nothing alike with subjects such as maths or geography learned in high school .
[native] the only people who lose out are importers who just slap on a made in wherever label to add artificial quality .
[native] russia at one point was even talking about joining the eu , but things went to shit .
[non-native] people should not only look on the money they can earn in their professions .
[non-native] they test each item and rank all of them afterwards in terms of quality or price .
[native] - june 2010 http://www.conservativehome.com/parliament/2010/06/iceland-must-repay-uk-depositors-if-it-wants-to-join-eu-warns-cameron.html i guess it would be more surprising if cameron said something and * was n't * being hypocritical .
[native] what 's a better media title > cameron crumbles under eu pressure for 1.7 bn fee > eu bill to be halved as cameron claims victory over eu if you think cameron bowing down and paying the charge in full would drive support away from ukip , you 're sorely mistaken .
[native] the eusceptic press have views that are more aligned to the views of the british public generally , and also in relation to the eu .
[non-native] in the past , people wanted to visit as many places as they can in a period of time .
[native] that 's something that becomes very clear once you start working within the machinery of european projects .
[native] dear god i havent heard boom boom boom boom since 2004 .
[native] though the likelihood of him doing something that stupid is decidedly less .
[native] then you turn the heat up a tiny bit more and say to the frog , `` do n't worry !
[non-native] also , the modern city tends to be larger and larger in size , and there is usuarally huge distance between people 's home and their work places .
[native] this site is an absolute joke , and has only been submitted to the racist subreddits .
[non-native] this can be said because younger people have more opportunities to do certain things than older people like play a sport , or go naked in your yard .
[non-native] all people should learn the most important elements out of all academic subjects .
[native] but it is not the girl 's fault her religion/husband/culture dictates that she wear a burqa .
[non-native] secondly probing into the facts and understanding them also helps a student on a personal front .
[non-native] is very difficult , in my opinion , think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
[non-native] besides , the costs of providing an own car increase more and more .
[native] true , you could argue that this can only be achieved through investment , and that could be achieved through increased use of the eib and private investment facilitated by the esm .
[non-native] on the contrary , if you travel alone or in a small group without a travel guide , you are responsible for managing all aspects of the trip .
[native] i said that there already was a temporary shutdown whilst a comprehensive safety review was undertaken .
[non-native] it was really difficult to do , but they got good grade at the end .
[non-native] however , students are also expected to understand the background ideas and concepts that lie behind such specific events to fully understand the learning material in a larger context .
[non-native] and teachers must make their structure of teaching easier to point out the basics ideas .every person in his or her life would have a golden period to enjoy his or her life in more than other periods , and in my opinion this golden period is in the age between 20 - 29 years , acording to that i absolotly agree with the statment thay says `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' and thats for many reaseons .
[non-native] they may have fun , but they get tired more quick and need more time to rest .
[native] i 'm guessing capitals , and they just did n't bother to check where capitals actually are .
[non-native] however , if they do not have time and money for their communities , there is no way to help others .
[non-native] i think that this is mainly because the drastic change that we are facing on the global level .
[native] i do n't know about in europe , but in canada , the bureaucracy around our various social assistance programs costs more that the actual amount of money granted to people through those systems .
[non-native] for my application for a student exchange programm with the government i was asked to spend some time in a place where people need my help .
[native] what is this about russia owning oil assets in serbia and why is that relevant to gas sales ?
[native] we 're going to keep going in this boom-bust cycle and it 's only going to get worse .
[non-native] it is going to stay for a bit longer time than people expect .i think that a general knowledge of many academic subject is the best way to understand which will be my future work .
[non-native] but after 18 you become a student and i am sure that everyone had liked its life at this period .
[non-native] in addition , the background of the house is very beautiful in only newspapers .
[non-native] with my personal experience , i think when you arrive at the university is important to understand ideas as well as learn facts .
[non-native] first , using cars will be more convenient in twenty years .
[non-native] however , this represents the beginning of the cars death .
[native] > one little point though , these were just the negotation directives .
[non-native] to begin with , broad knowledge allows us to chance to meet other people .
[native] > a eu without britain will be much more vulnerable to southern incompetence .
[native] if i was that wealthy i would pick a bigger city than dublin .
[non-native] doing always same things and waiting or watching the other ones doesnt make to earn much thing .
[non-native] accordingly so , others might find themselves proud and in tune with the aspects of their personality which they have deemed powerfull .
[native] you 're proposing invading a sovereign country and dumping ` undesirables ' there .
[non-native] i feel that half knowledge is just like `` half cup is always empty '' it never gets filled up .
[non-native] it seems as if education is always a main topic in a life .
[native] the eu will never be a rival power to the future china without a huge expansion in its militaries .
[native] an ex brought back a lovely instant coffee from thailand for me and after one cup , i resolved only to use it for iced coffee .
[native] i 'm a eu-sceptic and work professionally as an economist , so perhaps you should be more open-minded .
[native] either in `` western '' europe or the soviet bloc ?
[non-native] i think this is natural and what you need to do is see before you buy it .
[native] after the soviet union fell apart , the us was seriously considering ending nato as its purpose seemed moot .
[non-native] in favour to my decision i can suggest the examples of physics area in which newton has made a theory that every body in the universe is attracted towards the earth due to gravitational force .
[native] as a north american ( canadian , not from the u.s ) - what is it with italian politicians and racism ?
[native] > the question is if they left the eu how many of those created jobs would be lost ?
[native] it does n't mean they 've been granted anything .
[non-native] for example , momentous discoveries like computer , internet , telescope , etc. would not have been possible without taking the risk and considering the possiblity of failures .
[non-native] tour guids are very well educated about the historical , and cultural background of the places the group is visiting .
[non-native] you have to compare the prices and even you must have a look on the product .
[native] it 's not enough to just get on the phone to the police and make shit up .
[non-native] for instance , think a teacher who gives an assignment to the students about a political issue .
[native] your beaches , your food , your architecture , your history , your array of things for tourists to do ... the list goes on .
[non-native] thus , it is important not only to spot an opportunity at a given time but also to be constantly able to look for new opportunities .i agree with the statement , which said it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to sepcialized in one specific subject .
[non-native] thus , in my opinion it is better to attend the high school in a good way in order to achieve a broad knowdledge of many subjects , and then specialize in what you like the most when you are going to the university .i have always believed that all advertisements make products seem more efficient than they really are .
[native] there are also a lot of brazilians here with portuguese passports .
[non-native] while older people start to realise that they have less time , to make something of their lives , than they had , they start to focuse more on their careers and they devote all thier time to thier work and jobs .
[non-native] often we just buy a new product because the man in the newspaper had such a nice smile .
[non-native] firstly , when we look into the technological growth taking place aroung the world , one will understand that the humans are not satisfied with what they have .
[non-native] it is unknown whether by the rapid development in technology will replace something else with our precious cars but in this sequence we are having now i would say that there will be more cars in twenty years time than we have now .i think i would agree with the statement that it 's better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
[non-native] due to these reasons , i believe that young people do not spend enough time on helping in their communities .
[non-native] when we first meet a person , we do n't talk about specific subject deeply except some kind of academic meetings .
[native] stories emerge that tens of thousands of israeli pows have been killed and thrown in ditches in the sinai and the hauran , which raises israeli civilian/militia fear into hysterical rage and makes israeli resistance resolute .
[non-native] in today 's developing world media and advertisements do play in major role in enhancing the product .
[non-native] but it highlight that the important of the way .
[non-native] from these reasons , i prefer travelling by ourselves might be the best way to travel .
[native] the political elite knew this would happen , except they thought the west would have their back which is a stupid mistake to make .
[non-native] acording to the pofessor kim man-ho who is one of the famous socialist in korea , 68.2 % of students want to learn broad knowlwdge of mant academic subjects .
[native] it may seem like bluff , but i do n't think it is .
[native] the shareholders , those employed by the company , etc.
[native] the jewish banksters go all the way back to the medieval ages though , and i do n't believe in any of this zionist nwo bullshit because of it .
[native] my mother , who is also a government official in a different department , on the other hand , believes `` every politician is a liar , except nigel farage .
[non-native] what ever we learn will be a drop in the ocean , so it imposiible to persue in many acedamics .
[non-native] for example , talking with a person who have a defferent thinking towoad the art is very exaiting .
[non-native] they need to follow the tour guide 's schudel .
[native] theres a difference between shitty economic polices as in mass non payment of tax as was the case in greece and private entities bankrupting a state as was the case in ireland .
[native] the live with the cold the same way we live with the rain .
[native] > the euro yeah didnt work out great for us all ...
[native] * kolya ( kolja ) * - czech 1996 * burnt by the sun * - russia/france 1994
[native] even in the fucking article you told me to check ( which you edited out ) , it lists gats as a positive list approach , meaning only those areas specifically listed in the agreement are affected .
[native] what i do n't understand is why the shared competence of territorial cohesion is allowed to thwart willing participants who wish to be eu participants , but also sovereign nations .
[native] again , an arbitrary one which you picked for no practical reason .
[native] it probably is a magical number , in other words not real .
[non-native] their way to sell more product is to show their products better and they can do this easily since there is no control over the kinds of misrepresentations .
[non-native] it is troublesome , as it seems , but it keeps me freash in information and with a good status among my colleagues .
[native] republika srpska is one of two administrative entities in bosnia and herzegovina ; the other entity is the federation of bosnia and herzegovina .
[non-native] spending the trip withe experienced tour guide as well as a whole group of people , will give a great oppportunity to learn more in an informal and interesting environment .
[native] my assumption is that most of them are n't used to being challenged about their negative views on the eu , so any positive comments seem to be disproportionate to them .
[non-native] from this i can conclude that some people take risks and become successful persons and some people do the things which are already known .the first questions that comes to my mind after reading that statement is `` did people in the past spend more time helping their communities ? ''
[native] while you say there are ` points and counter points ' , i say there are legal principles and respect for other countries jurisdictions .
[non-native] then , what factors do we need in order to be successful people who try new things ?
[non-native] in combination with this families have started to purchase cars for each of the family member and you can easily witness the fact that in most of the families there are more than one car .
[native] yeah , it 's amazing how much massive economic growth can paper over all sorts of issues .
[non-native] the fear of encounting constant blizzards that has terrorized earth 's species over time should be quite enough to make people give up cars .
[native] the swedish army will put up a bit of a fight but after a week or so , your government will surrender to prevent more bloodshed , even though maybe a couple hundred soldiers will have died .
[non-native] this give us the impression that they are more relax but as always reality is by far more complex and comes in different colours and forms .
[non-native] well , i think this is all thing i want to say .
[non-native] if you go for research work later in your life then this understanding of topic would help you to take your research easily .
[native] well from an australian perspective there are a lot of risks , which i 'll ramble on about , one would be that education is our third largest export which we would n't be able to export to europeans anymore - as european students would be eligible for hecs and could n't be charged our very high international student course prices .
[non-native] the task of education is to learn general skills , concepts and cultural abilities that can be useful in different situations .
[non-native] for example for an elcectronics engineer in order to take very large scale integrated circuits ( vlsi ) as the career we need to have the complete knowledge of chip designing at the miniature levels .
[native] i ran into a group of such germans once on their first night in krakow .
[non-native] therefore , i think older people can enjoy more than young people .
[native] you still do n't get to steal someone else 's fucking home and divide their land up into apartheid cantonments .
[non-native] also they realize the futility of what they think to be enjoyable .
[native] the russian 's are as wary as anyone about the risks in some extremist group getting its hands on weapons that could threaten them .
[non-native] thirdly , i feel that one should be concious of that fact while taking risks/chances that success is not always a surity becasue we always do not get what we aim for .
[native] the best part of nz is the south island which is beautiful but much colder .
[non-native] also if a person is satisfied with whatever he has got and achieved it leads to its stagnation and he does not grow as an individual .
[non-native] though there are reasons i partly liked to travel in a group led by a tour guide , i do not think that is the best way to travel .
[non-native] we are able to live on the moon even .
[native] it 's not a matter of being politically correct , it 's a matter of you being an outright racist .
[non-native] i believe that these three personal features are requiered to be a talent and succesful person nowadays .
[native] why should the government shut them down if the production process is safe ?
[native] if it had been a college student or someone of less means they probably would n't have had as steep a fine .
[non-native] colleges in taiwan , however , put very little emphasis on community service when viewing applications .
[native] generally people who study stem degrees at mit are not complete idiots .
[native] hopefully we will leave the eu , but in the mean time we can seek to apply an `` emergency brake '' to reduce net migration .
[native] they did a study where they found that , on average , an eu migrant will pay more into the system than they 'll get .
[native] it was a political choice to wait for the european commission 's release of the exact figures be the start of the story instead of getting ahead of * that .
[native] it 's important to understand that pretty much every ratified treaty impinges on the sovereignty of the ratifying countries , as by definition they limit the actions the government can take , and in return that government gets certain benefits .
[non-native] those people having specialization in one subject will have less chances and oppertunities to get job compared to others .
[non-native] some companies just made their advertisements incompleated , as i said before they show you just the good part of the product , and sometimes they overfull you of their advertisements , so you will make your desition based on what you seen more often , you get to tell youself `` if you see it every where it most be good , so i will buy it '' .
[non-native] also general to specific will lead to attend different classes , interaction with different speciality of professor and making frinds with different area of interest , who may be helpful in future if you need any assisatnce when you are trying to get combine two or more feilds and get rid of many social problems .
[non-native] therefore , it will cost us too much to park our own cars in the city .
[native] if anything , it 's become a very mcarthian response where it 's like the whole ` red under your bed ' , only with ` shills ' .
[native] the vast majority of the public would like to repatriate at least some powers , and a good 40 % wish to leave .
[native] citing completely unspecified `` documents tombs and buildings '' is always the sign of a strong argument , is n't it ?
[native] actually , producers are paid to under-produce to prevent the butter mountains and wine lakes of the past .
[non-native] make it thinner , stronger , more attractive or affordable but not revolutionnary .
[native] i 'm not in touch with my local group here in sydney , but it 's my next step for sure !
[non-native] they can not discuss or protest something is oppsed to their country .
[non-native] for example > if i am specialized in a subject i can after start to read about diferent thing and learn aout it a little , while if i am someone who just know a little about some things i have to study very hard o have the specialized knowledge .
[native] he just assumed that which is generally true , that reddit users will not read the article , just the headline .
[native] > my whole point is you are not going to get anywhere in the world by having nothing to offer it besides a tax cut or `` patent box '' i got your overall point and disagree .
[native] the will of the people in those regions to be united , which obviously does n't exist in crimea .
[non-native] to make their advertisements liked by the companies that hire them they should prepare the advertisements such that they will persuade the company workers that this product will be sold .
[non-native] i also think that it would be easier to find a job when you are specialized on one subject .
[native] economically we just are n't that tied to europe in terms of trade , though there is a lot of investment both ways , we are much more tied to asia economically .
[non-native] i hold the opinion that the less subjects they take and the deeper they go into details in their study , the better it is .
[non-native] people usually said young people can to everything but older people are diffcult .
[non-native] thanks to mr. suzuki , i could cure my disease and came back to japan .
[native] i ca n't pick one so i 'll show a few that i like the most : * [ minnesota ] ( http://img860.imageshack.us/img860/4862/minnesotastatecapitol02.jpg ) * [ connecticut ] ( http://commons.trincoll.edu/policyvoice/files/2011/03/cfiles25066.jpg ) * [ idaho ] ( http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4041/4389958675_7ca0eca64f_b.jpg ) * [ missouri ] ( http://tomforst.com/statecaps/missouri/mo11165.jpg ) * [ california ] ( http://farm2.staticflickr.com/1254/5124211372_a7d5a196f2_b.jpg ) as for my favorite building in europe it would be [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rbj5ysd.jpg ) house in poland
[non-native] students to understand ideas and concepts is not good idea because come to the subjects like physics and chemistry its not provide good understanding and concepts these subjects very difficulty to understand because this subjects very vague from ancient time .
[native] i actually went to go check if it really is day 35,988 .
[native] i think you 're pretending we live in a world where the niceties of international law are still respected .
[non-native] for example , someone is excellent at washing clothes and washes them really well , but that skill will not be awarded because everyone washes clothes in a washing machine and so the skill is useless .
[native] listen to how he 's played every side for the past 15 + years in order to get to the top .
[native] > > refused to abort one of the children > > are we talking about mammals ?
[native] unfortunately more recently the once legendary tv presenter jimmy savvile turned out to have molested people in our main hospital :( in good news the city is very diverse with major jewish and sikh communities .
[native] it 'd be a massive win for brussels if it went through .
[native] your flag is similar to the skÃ¥ne flag but it turns out to be from a completely different country hehehe
[non-native] every scholar is expected to focus on a specific issue .
[native] this means the west will always have some leverage over russia .
[native] which is why i would strongly support the uk holding a referendum soon to decide their membership .
[native] that 's an * awful * justification for serbian war crimes , and even more * awful * justification for a serbian victim narrative .
[non-native] then they took the next step or `` risk '' of questioning it and redefining it with a new startegy .
[native] corporations in japan are typically sharded into lots of shares which are owned by possibly multiple holding companies , with * their * shares that are sharded between tons of ppl , etc.
[non-native] i argue that it is better to specialize in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
[non-native] it could be advisable to use time efficiently during our life because time is valuable .
[non-native] in brief , i firmly beleive that now , young peole do not use their time to working at their communites , because their parents let them focus on only their studies .
[non-native] in my opinion , people who have achieved success can definately try and work on more things and get involved with the element of risk .
[native] to understand their motives , you need to look at it from their point of view .
[non-native] in my opinion , i can not agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
[native] decentralisation is the only real model for such diverse nations in southern europe like spain
[non-native] so , the factories can not stop building more cars in the next twenty years , because they want more money .
[native] jokes aside , that ranks egypt as 121st in the world .
[non-native] true understanding of any subject is to be said - when all the ideas and the purpose should be clearly known but how one can imply thes into practicality ?
[native] well , proudhon did n't mean it * literally * .
[non-native] there are many number of ways to feell enjoyment and to make enjoyment .
[native] edit : if anyone else has some other sources for this , i 'd like to see them .
[native] correct , but that was out of protest that developing countries like india and china were exempted from it .
[native] it 's the middle of winter here in new zealand , be happy that it 's summer !
[non-native] it 's not usually feeling show that product is good even though it is new .
[non-native] if news deals with politics and the role of the government or the whole political organization , the student has to understand ideas and concepts of different parties of the government for instance , in order to understand better and to be able to learn more easily the facts of the society and understand why the society react in this way .
[non-native] there is a wide range of persons and institutions that require our time .
[native] a divided , weak europe that 's under constant russian threat & incapable of responding to regional security concerns , thus making them more dependent on my country and forcing both our resources & focus away from asia and back to europe .
[non-native] however to reach a sustainable state of security and stability , so you can enjoy life more , some plannig is indeed necesary at any stage of your life .you are active enough when you are young and this enables young ones to go for making enjoyment .
[non-native] so it is clear that it is up to everyone to do what he wants to do but i think everyone has also the task to show respect for the community itself and for what they do for every part of the society you live in .young people nowadays tend to be less helpful to the community .
[native] voting ukip is the best way of increasing the chance of a brexit .
[non-native] the time we life now we can have lot of usefull tools or good medthion to keep our life more easiler and healther , we all have to thanks about thoser sucessful people , the are not just sucessfllthe topic discuss about the less time that the young people have to halping their communities .

[native] in the us beers comes in 16 or 20 oz .
[native] when they 're in a boom , however , they start getting really uppity and start talking about secession .

[native] on the isds > and should be without prejudice to the right of the eu and the member states to adopt and enforce , in accordance with their respective competences , measures necessary to pursue legitimate public policy objectives such as social , environmental , security , stability of the financial system , public health and safety in a non-discriminatory manner i 've been telling you people for months that it 's not going to prevent the eu implementing environmental laws and the like ` because companies can sue for lost future profits !!!! ' .

[native] in these cases new modern houses and building blocks were built , sometimes in a social realist style other times in the international style of late modernism .

[non-native] we need both kind of people to go on evolving .
[non-native] this will promote the use of the car , nowadays a little bit pinpointed due to the contaminating effect they produce .i agree .
[native] whether christianity has become a good religion is a different matter , but i would n't dispute christ was a good prophet or a good person .
[native] maybe i am doing legatum institute an injustice but i get the feeling they have some odd methodology .
[native] this way is completly democratic , provides a checks-and-balances system that always goes with the will of the people and has minimum bueracracy , and will keep the population engaged with politics .
[native] no , but they use it in reference to any western intervention , even by a secular nation such as the united states .
[native] or are you dead set on a dick wagging contest just to show off who can be the biggest arsehole ?
[native] i work in toronto and holy crap , every east asian nationality has one ineffable thing in common : they all dump on the filipinos .
[non-native] also , as a treasurer of the high school , i organize a fundrasing event to send some money to the local hospitals ; the turn outs are great , proving that the young people still care about their communities , and the only problem is that they do n't have enough spare time to help the communities everyday .
[native] regarding the commission : they are not * directly elected * , but they are * indirectly elected * through national parliaments .
[native] it 's completely true that the eastern countries desired to get into nato very much .
[non-native] in my opinion it is important to know that broad knownledge of many sectors/subjects is important but it is even more important to specify in a specific sector/subject .
[non-native] it is said that there will be 25 % of old people living .
[native] putin is a scrub , what makes you so sure i like him ?
[non-native] if a person finds one work interesting , he/she will drive immense enjoyment in doing it , even though the same job might appear extremely drab to another person .

[non-native] they know very well the meaning of death and they will die in anytime .
[native] i agree , the uk loan to ireland did not represent a massive risk to the uk .

[native] why are the snp so incapable of handling the banter ?
[native] you ca n't run the same monster mowers in europe like you can on the american prairie , nor do we have the space to let huge herds of animals roam like in new zealand .
[native] just because they exist does n't mean they 're followed by the majority of warring factions nowadays .
[non-native] if i am with a tour guide , i might need to pay for somthing which i am not willing to spend .

[native] normally one would use `` laughable '' or `` ludicrous '' .
[non-native] u stop and leave of your patterns , not your ae encourage by your relatives and working staff to go on .
[non-native] especially for young people who have their entire life in front of them & its time now for them to decide in what direction they will steer their attention to get to the destination which will take life to the aim that they have to achieve .
[non-native] they can think of new inteserting things to do .
[native] the cap is in an almost constant state of reform all the time .
[native] china 's moves in central asia were going to happen regardless of ukraine .
[non-native] older people or adults are expected to be more mature that children and therefor they are not alowed or more precisly not expected to do these imature things , which everyone finds more fun .
[non-native] many situations in life could determine if a risk is worth taking , and are related to the field in wich the decision are taken and the fallouts of this decision .
[native] furthermore , russia 's economic fate is tied more closely with europe than with china by virtue of its geography .
[native] we are under the protection of a nuclear power .
[native] why not leave them in when they fulfil conditions ?
[non-native] this growth tendency might be reduced if the different governements and non governemental organisations try and work together to control that expansion .
[native] you said that they `` owned that area '' when talking about constantinople .
[non-native] so facts must be teached the students in schools .
[non-native] it is a wide field that has managed to gain control of how we view everything around us , from politics to groceries .
[non-native] and at the end when you want to go somewhere with a tour guide it is always two or three times expensive than you go alone or with your friends .
[native] 100 mile house 108 mile house 108 mile ranch 150 mile house 40 miles flats 7 miles corner 70 mile house 93 mile house all in bc , canada .

[non-native] many experts recommend that if you are to make a success , first you become a specialist .

[native] clarification : not born irish , family moved to america in the 80 's .
[non-native] as a result , a new technology will take place .i agree the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and conceps , though facts are essential to learn some subjects such as history .
[non-native] since much of the world population still lives in developing or under developed countries we can say that number of people owning cars in the present day is less compared to that who do n't own .

[native] the contents of the trucks are unconfirmed , true , but it 's also important to note that 32 * tanks * crossed the border too .

[native] i vote ukip because it makes a brexit more likely .
[native] you are quite crazy , those sources do n't support any of your arguments .

[native] further - through the thin veil of free trade - they 're trying to standardise patients and copyright across nations while at the same time extending the duration they apply .
[native] it would also mean the end of individual take-or-pay contracts , combined with no re-sale clauses , meaning the eu could order less gas than normal .
[native] i refuse to let myself be captured by the downfall of this country because that old bigot down the pub with very pronounced views on immigrants actually * went and did it * when he said he was going to run for prime minister .

[native] there are some jobs which machines can not do - yet .
[native] which is why i started out by pointing out the extreme examples .
[non-native] tipically in young peoples like school ages , they do n't have to work for to living .
[native] that 's why china has n't come out in support of russia in any way that has meaning .

[native] illegally entering their territorial waters to dump shit on the shores is invading .

[native] the public buy newspapers for a whole range of reasons , of which editorial lines is one .
[non-native] that is , because of the less time they get to devote to community service , young people do not understand the joy , purpose and responsiblity involved in the process of community service .
[non-native] teachers and the educational system should put more emphasis on educating students the basic ideas and concepts .travelling around the world is a very interesting and educating experience .
[native] not sure where you 'd get the idea that the ep could have any say in the matter .
[native] if i were you i 'd get used to the idea now .
[native] the majority of people who visit the irish republic are going to visit the rest of the british isles anyway , so it would make perfect sense if we all used sterling .

[native] i think we should be giving more support , funding & equipment , even training , to the ukrainian government , as well as covert support , such as intelligence sharing & even black ops by covert special forces , but a straight-up conventional war & overt intervention is n't going to do any good for anybody , no matter what side of the fence you sit on .
[non-native] in my view , for this fast changing world having broad knowledge in many academic subjects is better .having broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one subject may leads to messing up of subjects .
[non-native] sometimes it works but in this case it does not .

[non-native] apart from the temple they will take us to all the other places which is famous or has some other historic standing .
[native] the eu was great in theory but the execution was sloppy and undemocratic , and now everyone is too afraid to abandon it because it represents the european dream .
[native] you ca n't possibly be worse than those cunts in westminster .
[non-native] young people are becoming unhappy day by day by unemployment , lack of money and lack of care in the community .
[non-native] but , to me , saying that this change will occure within twenty years is false .
[native] also , living in an integrated country with a strong set of common values and a uniting culture is not `` an idyllic bubble '' .
[native] if it turns out nobody is willing to pay for it , then you go back to truck driving , or some other job which is hopefully more appealing , in order to get the supplementary income back , because you 're not content with subsistence living .
[non-native] in my point of view it 's better to have a huge knowledge of academic subjects .
[native] > what if you knew without a doubt you were going to die ?
[non-native] through the mass medium , we can see the negative impacts brought about by our inappropriate treatment to the environment , for example , excessive car emission , which has a profound impact on the envrionment by polluting the air .
[non-native] this would lead to disagreements or unequal time spent at the visited locations .
[native] looking at r/europe , you 'd think the rest of the world is doing just fine and the eu is the only thing holding europe back from greatness .
[non-native] but , in the future , can happen that , if the price of petroleum increase very much , people will not use car in order to not spend much money .

[native] you do not fuck with a croatian mothers perfectly white and meticulously ironed sheets .
[non-native] therefore , most advertisements try to show the products much better at the beginning to have the goverment approval in distributing them .
[native] well , my personal opinion , we should disolve the ` five eyes ' treaty and return communication between states to diplomats and the foreign ministery .
[native] my two cents : i do n't object to free movement of labour .
[native] and if you do n't support this * common sense * you 're a radical leftist as being against * those people * is a very centrist view based in rationality and logical proofs .
[non-native] but the changing mindset is certainly coming because of the incoming of the new generation of people in these fields .
[non-native] even though a car provides comfort that public transportation lacks and is also easier to use for your schedule the cons are largely outnumbering the pros and with the awareness of all the trouble the environment is having , many are rethinking their frequent car use .
[native] good friday brought more involvement in ni from our government not less .
[native] if the allies wanted to stop hitler 's invasion of poland they could n't have helped him .

[native] i use green as good and red as bad .
[non-native] to begin with , we can learn ideas and concpets in class and our teacher , but sometimes they do n't work in the real society .
[non-native] by having knowlege of all the subjects we know the details of each subject and we can make use of it whenever we want it .
[non-native] they are still novice when it comes to the skills of living life .

[native] seriously , read the shit that you submit before submitting it .
[non-native] to tell the truth , to say `` the best way '' is very difficult for me .
[non-native] for example a small test everyday , big exam onece a month and leaving certificate for end of the school which is really important for the colleage .

[native] english sounds easy on paper but the rules have a shitload of exceptions , and it has a basically infinite vocabulary .
[non-native] i love to travel with my parents , but of course , there were many times that we traveled in a group led by a tour guide .
[native] oddly though , ecuador uses us dollar coins all the time , which is hilarious .
[non-native] another point that would support the thesis is that children are relatively sorrowless .
[native] if you compare the gdp in euros : the peak was 189b in 2007 and it will meet that again this year .
[native] Ã¾ as in thigh , Ã° as in thy .
[non-native] like if we had a cardiac doctor if you asked him he well tell you that he is trying to be the best and to invent a new methods to fix the heart .
[native] just accept your government fucked up , and move on .
[non-native] due to his vision and his dare to dream big and try a new way of refining petroleum to create useful by products , dhirubhai ambani ( the late owner of reliance ) was extermely influential and rich and famous by the time he passed awy two years earlier .
[non-native] so i think every one sould at least try once .a man goes for an interview thinking he is right for the job .
[non-native] without learning facts just understaing the ieads and concepts are useless and after a certain time we will forget what what we was learning .
[non-native] secondly , as we are making more and more progress in technology , the prices of the cars would come down .
[native] cast your eyes on the stunning beauty of [ the station in the town i live in ] ( https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7229/7288798878_68044dd9a5_b.jpg ) brutalism was not a good time for architecture .
[native] otherwise you have to release a very angry person at some point .
[non-native] as the deposit of acknowledge is too tremendous for one person 's brain capacity and because of the computer , our past job , which was just accepting knowledge , was substituted by the computer .
[non-native] another example is , in ramadan ( the season of fasting for saudis ) , there are a lot of youths providing dates and water to the drivers in the traffic signs in order to break their fast .
[non-native] the intensity of either kind of happiness can be overwhelming , while each feeling corresponds to the degree of maturity i have reached .
[native] the fall of the ruble does n't affect putin and his billionaire cronies , for most of their money is invested in the west and not within russia .
[non-native] even if they get vacation they are not able enjoy that time because of stress .
[non-native] they said that time they really enjoy their life and did what every they want .
[native] `` benefit tourists '' `` stealing british jobs '' etc.
[native] it was leaked because it was only known by governments .
[non-native] in my opnion , the problem with having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is that the person can not have a strong and deep knowledge of each one of them because he or she will have practically unlimited sources of study , and this will derive in knowing just a few things or very superficial facts of each subject .
[non-native] for example , if a person had a psycology course he would understand the acts of his teenage children .
[native] > here 's hoping nato stays out of it .
[native] > and that will change quickly after the exit .
[non-native] during the discussion , you might have different opinion with others .
[non-native] however , these days there is not so much difference between traveling alone and traveling in a tour thanks to the development of information technology .
[non-native] the old people take every things responsblity and they cannt joke in every thing as young people .
[non-native] tv tells us that we can be as pretty as brittany spears or jennifer lopez only if we wear levi 's low rise jeans .
[non-native] one of them is increase in pollution level in the atmosphere .
[native] or do n't use circles because humans are terrible at telling the difference between sizes of them .
[native] but you have to remember that sinn fÃ©in are a fundamentally nationalist party , regardless of the fact that they 're far left economically , and nationalist parties from all around europe are on the rise .
[non-native] he will continue thinking and planning things in the same way which make his task less interesting and less challenging and at a point of time it might lead to frustration , for example when someone constantly keeps on typing the same format 100 times a day it becomes boring for him too continue it , instead if he tries out a better font style new colour combination or maybe a better matter to fill up the letter sheets then he is definately trying out something that makes a dull job as writting responce letters , interesting .
[non-native] as a society everyone has an important and different contribution to do and the knowledge or academic preparation is what make possible to do it well .
[non-native] so advertisements do deceive us in some way which we fail to recognise when we are watching them .
[native] the truth is that it 's a muslim conspiracy .
[non-native] for instance , a worker in a company could find a job with using a typewriter , fifteen years ago .
[native] [ i always like the theme song for metal gear solid ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jye0uabtln0 ) and [ this avicii cover is pretty good as well .
[non-native] as understanding ideas and concepts , they can feel the joy of discovery .
[native] the us and the ussr were n't exactly trusting , it 's unfathomable that they would have an agreement about something so important and not put it on paper .
[non-native] in fact , our society shows admiration for these kinf of people .
[non-native] instead , you can let others taking risks and watch their results .
[non-native] for exmple a person who is not specialized in the field of computers , but has a vast knowledge of everything where would he be standing in the world of computers , no where , as he wont be able to have the integreity of and wont be having the complete knowledge of computers .
[native] from a username called ` paki criminal ' as well ...
[native] but hey , we keep being told that the eu prevents britain from nuking france ( because trust me we reaallly want to ) , so we should believe it .
[native] > eurosceptics tend to leave the nitty-gritty of committee work and lawmaking to the insiders .
[native] i 'm suggesting that what he caused was an accident essentially , and that he 's fortunate there 's a cost he will avoid paying in tort .
[non-native] they did that because credibility matters and fake advertisements kill credibility .
[non-native] moreover , they has a healthy mind than others .
[native] if the people of crimea want to be a part of russia ( which they obviously do , but very likely not in the overwhelming numbers russia indicates ) , why should russia ` pay ' for annexing it ?
[native] i am sure the canadian government is all ears on your plan to deal with the bogus refugee claimants coming from romania .
[non-native] secondly , coming to the friends community the young people make time in enjoying with the friends , help them in preparing for the exams , also clarify the doubts if any amomg themselves .
[non-native] for example , take the engineering studies the people who take up this course have to be perfect in their field that is either computers , civil , mechanical etc. but they finish their course without any knowledge and after that when they go for job interviews they began to feel the importance of a particular subject and start gaining knowledge of that subject .
[native] all banning burqas will do is restrict their freedom even more .
[native] if by `` fork over extra money '' you mean comply with the state labor laws , then yes .
[native] china has strong institutional systems that can enforce a one-child policy .
[native] completely removing scotland would give you something like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5v6na3m.jpg ) .
[non-native] in bref cars is an main of entertement that is now nessesery for every one and i tkink it would be more in the next few years because of the devlopment of every things and it would be more neede to do what you are eccepected to do .
[native] both paris and germany appear to be keen on heavy regulation , which finance does not like .
[native] where they were have street fairs , large community parties , etc.
[native] the real question is , can it into space ?
[native] he even managed to plug irish tourism while he was at it , pretty damn smooth i must say .
[non-native] maybe it would be possible to learn like that for an university test but there are a lot of possibilities to fail the test because it 's very easy to forget some informations or to invert some facts .
[non-native] maybe , a person that chooses this kind of education will increase his or her ability to understand concepts from many areas of knowledge more easily than other people .
[native] we did krakow with the salt mines and death camps .
[non-native] first of all nowadays young people have a lot of things to do in school .
[non-native] in other words , as people get more educated and concern about the environment more , one can expect the see less cars in the future .
[non-native] this limitates greatly the possibilities for advertisement to make products better on screen than in real life .
[non-native] travelling in a group alone or with friends in a foreign country without a tour guide is like getting lost in a maze .
[native] there was also the soviet union and that whole cold war thing .
[non-native] but on careful consideration , i think the positive factores in my opinion can offset and exceed the negative factors .
[native] it 's present structure is a lot more organic than ours given that it 's powers & authority have been pretty much chipped away at piece-by-piece since the turn of the last century instead of set in stone with clear restrictions .
[native] for example i do n't know why you feel the need to always bring up this obamacare thing , but it appears in at least 20 % of your posts on the ttip as if it 's proof positive that ttip is evil .
[non-native] no one has the right to stop anybody from gaining knowledge for their satisfaction .i think that are both important for the knowledge of the student .
[non-native] taking all these points into consideration , i can say with a good degree of confidence , that the number of cars would definitely decline in the future .
[non-native] so i think , young people nowadays and all age peoples can take enough time to helping their communities .
[native] but what about all the bullshit myths about how evil monsanto is , and that 's why we should n't allow gm ?
[native] the main - and often quoted - argument for joining the eu is that shared sovernty in a supranational union ( the eu ) can protect the sovernty of each member state at the international level more effectively than if they were to negotiate alone .
[non-native] secondly , the tour guide will decide the time they are looking , so you are not able to see it as long as you want .
[non-native] like some one is an engeneering but at the same time he can creat other bussnis away from his major , like he could work at the stocks or open a store to sell any thing .
[non-native] thus , successful people have to try new ones to get more developed world .
[native] then you also think that all cabinet meetings should be done in public , politicians emails should be able to be accessed , etc ?
[non-native] however in modern society most of them enjoy their lives more than the older people .
[non-native] it was such a big difference compare to if i was with a group .
[non-native] moreover , no one can claim to be best at all fields .
[native] > he still thinks that we should respect russia 's sphere of influence rather than deny them it in order make russia feel better that it 's not a superpower anymore .
[non-native] but these people will probably have more contact with locals and a total difference experience and view of the visited country .
[non-native] if i were given the data regarding the growth rate of various countries their population , their economic policies only then can i clearly say whether there would be an increase or decrease in number or cars .every person is having the different nature .
[native] secondly , why do you think this would be the case .
[native] he said on october 1st that he '' ... will not take no for an answer . ''
[native] soon enough they 'll be able to go to spain though .
[native] i 'd much rather have well informed and well-rounded americans than just another ` murica circle jerker .
[native] oh i know like us you have tons of ethnic and quality restaurants by now , but unlike say italy or france , you do n't have excellent food culture present in even the tiniest town .
[native] sorry , that sounds terrible :( how did such a situation happen ?
[native] edit : i forgot to mention , i 've also heard great things about valencia .
[native] > but they 're betting on gaining more power over fiscal policy rather than an exit .
[native] practically no-one from the uk cares what argentina believes about the matter .
[non-native] we can only see the side effects or bad consequences only when there is any law or regulations that they should indicate them like tabbaco or medicine .
[native] only people who are a bit simple would think that 's the truth :)
[native] just like serbs were the victims in the balkan wars , right ?
[native] out of curiosity how did a german person hear about that ?
[non-native] so teachers must teach them many viewpoints and opinions of several people , and then let them make their own idea and evaluate the situation .
[native] ... and to turn the telly off in the ad break until the kettle boils .
[non-native] he must be focused on what he is interested .
[native] why is a fiscal union the solution for europe and not the rest of the world ?
[non-native] in my experience , i was young and i was in korea , i watched the advertisements about new robot toys .
[native] `` squawk box '' ( the show that joe kernen co-hosts ) is a breakfast morning show on cnbc and is mostly humor and business news , and not much actual reporting .
[native] even with the uk in the eu , the eu is not balanced .
[native] the only country of economic consequence they 're aligned with is china , and china wo n't rock the boat where business is concerned .
[native] no one is `` trying '' to stop you , europe is calling for monetary responsibilities from their partner , or i 'm missing the point ?
[non-native] in further analysis the statement is drawing an in appropriate and indefinsible in some cases for example , if successful person is trying a new thing if it will not work meanshis reputation and fame all will lost for making a small mistake .
[native] the only different thing about the two sets of propaganda is the attitude * you * have towards them .
[native] furthermore he was going to kill those that were `` democratically '' elected .
[native] he 'd already been drinking , he is russian after all .
[native] angry tongans demonstrated their opposition to the sale of tongan nationality , called for limitations on the king 's powers ( he was the one to approve the whole thing ) and demanded to know what had happened to the money . ''
[native] i was actually surprised when i realised it 's not widely celebrated across europe .
[non-native] if students understand the concepts and ideas that construct the equations , not only will the students be able to answer the questions correctly , they would be able to complete the course with confidence that they could answer similar questions in the future .
[non-native] however , even in a situation like this the basic fact remains valid that without taking some risk you may miss your chances .
[native] also , if you only promote such brigades , you 're going to have some serious problems to contend with in the future .
[non-native] therefore , it is not the issue to copy and paste informations .
[non-native] the rapid rise of several coountries such as india and china will only increase the car markets for the manufacturer , leading to higher production .
[native] there 's only ever a small number of people who think resorting to violence is the solution .
[non-native] when he was in college , he majored in history .
[non-native] there are a lot of examples one can speak about , for example .
[non-native] i believe the cars increase rate will be reduced , however , there will be more cars in twenty years time .
[non-native] we have to admit that cars , as the fastest land transportation means , save us a lot of time in our daily life .
[non-native] if such a great invention can not be made to either the transportation system or to the marketing of this system to become widespread , the project seems to fail down and people prefer to use their own cars rather than the new system .
[native] that way , the poorer countries would remain financially independent .
[native] i 'd say the numbers for other countries are off as well .
[native] it is a way of describing the efficiency of the workforce in an economy or how much you need to pay in labour costs to achieve a given level of production .
[non-native] with the advancement of medicine and medical research the complexity of each medical field increased and it became harder and harder for an individual to keep up with the advanced knowledge in each field .
[native] in fact i ca n't point to a single occasion where imposed partition has lessened tension and violence , not increased it .
[native] again , there 's no problem if some seeds from the neighbours crop come over to yours and start growing gm plants .
[native] well hamas officially stated they wanted to kill all jews , and israel has done nothing of the sort .
[native] sorry every time switzerland comes up i immediately think of archer .
[non-native] one must pay special attention to the fact that the statement only concerns a particular group in society , which is defined by age , and disregards any other group .
[non-native] people may alternate ways for their transport in feature .
[native] even among the tabloids there is a division of opinion .
[native] / u/christ0ph , i 'm going to ask you very explicitly so maybe you can understand this and provide what i 'm asking for .
[non-native] moreover , the age of this young people represents an advantage , for they are ambitious , they can set themselves future purposes , in the hope to fulfill these objectives .
[non-native] and for getting so deep into the subject i am sure that it is crucial to focus and to specialize in one specific topic .
[native] it 's also hard because they 've been fucked with by the world for so long .
[native] because i 've seen your poor argumentation in the past , and until i see sources with quotes i do n't feel like wasting my time .
[native] did you really wan na hold those countries up as examples ?
[native] the west almost destroyed them in 1991 and after a brief dance with democracy the economy collapsed and we have the same story as before only a weaker russia , threatened from all sides , with less allies etc.
[non-native] one can not say that the risk of hannibal to pass tha alpines ( the mountain above the italy ) in the middle of the winter was not a risk , but at the end he reached with his chosen army to the center of italy to rome .
[non-native] moreover there is the problem of pollution , cars came out many toxic substances and in future will be necessary change about motors and , if it will be not possible , we can obbligatory decrease number of cars .
[native] he did lose his government to a pre-mature general election last year , after all .
[native] all the farms would be better off if britain was still in charge .
[non-native] brand reconition can make one product different to others .
[native] i 'd support the breakup of the us and canada into a bunch of smaller states ( quebec , california , new england etc ) , with a supra-national `` north american union '' .
[native] and yes it is good we live in an age where the worst excesses of clerical power and a christian political structure have been chipped away , but saying that because we live in a `` secular age '' it diminishes the centuries of religious influence is ridiculous .
[native] air superiority is just so obvious on the western side .
[non-native] in the other hand , old people are often ill , not only in their bodies but also in their souls and minds , they have lived throught calamities , heart breaks , forgot , unforgivenness , death of other beloved partners , and thats why they have lost ( the bigger part of them , there is still many old people with hope and inocence ) all the features that can make a human being enjoy life .
[non-native] due to the lack of hours , i can only go there once a month , for i have to prepare for my school work .
[non-native] companies which makes that products have people who they must pay .
[non-native] the point i want to emphasize here is that human spirits never ever get old .
[non-native] this type of thinking by the youngsters is good only upto a certain extent that is upto earning a respectable position in the society , but you have to return something to the the society from which you have taken something and that is your services to the society .
[non-native] concepts and idea sometimes sufficient to deal efficeiently with the problem but it might take longer time than employing formula which is a short-cut method to reach the answer .
[native] all opinion polls indicate that ukip does best with c1 , c2 and d social classes .
[native] ** [ horst wessel lied ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mb5mjwz7kxk ) **
[non-native] these experiences will be good basis for having specific major .
[native] unfortunately it 's just what happens because the issue is so contentious .
[native] it sounds like the legislative quasi-equivalence of the uk position .
[non-native] therefore , it is impossible like the topic predicts that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
[non-native] but here again , i believe that having a guide for a smaller group is more interesting since we have more opportunities to speak with him and to ask him questions than we would have in a larger group .
[native] now the usa has slapped country of label origins on food products from canada , which is meant to help americans buy more food produced in america , canada be damned .
[native] i do n't think regulators should be expected to predict the uk media backlash for something that until then nobody had any strong feelings about .
[native] except that ` net contribution ' does n't account for the depression of native employment and their burden on the state , and the effect it has on wages for the natives .
[native] no , there were death camps in south africa set up by the british .

[native] the report divides possible outcomes into three categories : in `` type 1 '' , such as sweden in the early 1990s , the level of output falls , never to regain its pre-crisis trend , but the growth rate recovers ; in the more damaging `` type 2 '' , as in japan since the 1990s , there is no absolute fall in output , but potential growth falls far short of the pre-crisis rate ; finally , in `` type 3 '' , as in the eurozone now and probably the us and uk , there is both a fall in output and a permanent fall in potential growth .
[native] and if you 're a unionist but scottish ( as you said ) , are you a `` yes '' vote ?
[native] would be analogous to saying `` said a french '' .
[native] heh , i actually wrote a post once [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1ztbsz/the_french_train_company_sncf_has_been_told_it/cfwsy7z ) on the kind of shenanigans that go on with airbus-boeing subsidization , and would be an area where isds would perhaps be extremely beneficial to the eu .
[native] they 're migrants because it has n't been determined yet whether they 're genuine asylum seekers or illegal immigrants .
[non-native] it is because that i think these changes will occur that i say that the number of cars will not diminish in the future .
[non-native] for domiant people and me specalizing in one specific subjects is better , beacuse of the following reasons .
[non-native] furtheremore , if people have a lot of luggage or something , they difficultly carry on the train or bus .
[non-native] anyway , i preferred to be focused on my major .
[non-native] an example that accompnies this point is that a senior with a family can be respected by his/her children or even grandchildren .
[native] i did n't realise erasmus was no longer a thing .
[non-native] i think we can use community relationships for our rehabilitations of emotional problems .
[native] it 'd be great if you did n't use racist codewords like ` enriched ' ( everyone knows what you mean ) .
[native] this was effective in granting independence to the dominions , but i 'm not sure it would be effective in creating a federal structure within a single state with a tradition of parliamentary supremacy .
[native] how do i know it 's a republican who said this ?
[native] australia is about to start having the debate about if we should protect our industries or let them die and ` invest in training ' instead .
[native] you do n't end up in a courtroom unless someone 's thrown a punch .

[non-native] especially for historical places you need to go and see this place to understand and to feel the history better .
[native] they did n't just sit down one day and decide to say fuck it to over 1000 years of constantly shifting boundaries , wars , identities etc.
[non-native] also in my opinion young people have an imagie for community which is too hard .
[non-native] in contrast with just knowing about the ideas and concepts , learning facts is more useful and attractive for students than learning some ideas and concepts just for understanding .
[non-native] when i was in childhood my parents had a car .
[non-native] basically , those activities are not provided by the tour agency .
[native] i like romania 's one better than the ussr 's one ( which has the same tune as russia 's one ) .
[native] all you need to get is proof such as a birth certificate if they have it or check the irish records for the birth record .
[native] yeah there were immigrants , but it kindof all just blended together .
[non-native] i think that adult works all day and maybe they do n't have many times to help other because they are too tired .
[native] add in a couple more smaller eurosceptic papers and you can get to 4 million maybe .
[native] they wo n't vote , the yes vote will be inflated and it 'll push the movement on .
[native] he 's a known nutter who does n't read what you write , just posts more and more articles , each one less relevant and more wrong than the last .
[non-native] as paradoxical as it may sound , i have always experienced it to be the best way never to be alone .helping in communities
[non-native] every one today need to compete on a world level so one need to be very much target oriented if he wants to make significant progress in his professional life .
[non-native] but we usually forget them and focuses only on the big one decision because those can completely change our life .
[non-native] a public poll was even made when the perfume was released and the results supported my opinion greatly .

[native] it actually does n't seam like a bad way to commemorate the people who died in the war .
[native] ireland ca n't comply with the schengen agreement because it shares a border with the uk and has freedom of movement with the uk , which has come about from nearly a century of bilateral relations .
[native] i have n't heard anything about brics in general , but china has n't been overly enthusiastic about russia 's actions .
[non-native] that means , the student can use all the facts and ideas he learned in a hole on a new topic .
[native] i 'm shitty with timezones , but the vote should be over in 7 hours , right ?
[non-native] in addition , these people want to spend more time with their families instead of spending time working .

[non-native] i have the chance to have a friend working in an agency that develops advertisemnts for both italian or foreign clients .
[native] when i 'm still at the `` convert to pounds '' mindset , i normally add about a third .
[native] i think the take away is that our job market is a lot healthier than it is in much of europe , but we still have a ways to go before we get back to where we were in the previous two * recessions * .
[non-native] now i can say that is truth that some young people do not give their time for different motivation but i sure that also only one little help , like a sweety word is important to help someone .
[non-native] after having brought these goods , they may realize that they make a wrong decision to buy such things .
[native] everything that * could * be done legally * was * done legally .
[native] yes , but as the poster above said , when referring to america people associate it with the political entity , rather than the geographic one .
[native] i 'm sure some spanish or portuguese people posting here would be surprised to hear that their history did n't take place in europe from around 711 to 1492 .
[native] i shudder to think of the day when this becomes an official metric for government .
[non-native] some assume that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepsts in , contrary to those , some think that learning facts is more important than understanding them .
[native] > closing down borders and pretending this is n't happening is just not an option .
[native] at this point in time there were plenty of powerful kings and queens across europe as well , it was very standard for the time and hardly tyrannical compared with the events going on in that same period .
[non-native] i think this is fundamental for keeping our academies open to new ideas and to academic as well as professional collaborations that can result from interdisciplinary views .i believe that most of the products we see on tv or magazines are much better than they really are .
[non-native] for example , imaging a person going on a date for the first time .
[native] `` but oh , private enterprise is fine and dandy as long as it is not huge corporations owning everything , we wo n't nationalize * everything * '' , but distinguishing good corp from evil corp becomes really subjective .
[non-native] on day iam asked to my father i want to drive car but my father not accepted the driving car .

[native] lifenews , a pro-kremlin website with links to the law enforcement agencies , said he had cut his hand and then fallen and hit his head after suffering blood loss .
[non-native] the same goes for poor people in developped countries .
[non-native] today there are a lot of organaizations that are very concerned about the pollution and the damaged of the environment .
[native] the internet , and reddit specifically , helped to organize and popularize them , through the subreddit / r/podemos ----- there 's no reason why other political movements ca n't use the internet or different kinds of [ democracy software ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/basicincome/comments/2kvesd/in_spain_we_are_the_best_candidate_oecd_country/clpf6mt ) to organize themselves .
[native] if not then we could leave it up to the teenager to decide .
[non-native] however , from my point of view , it is wise to agree the statement .
[non-native] in conclusion , i predict that the number of cars will rise instead of decline .
[non-native] in the long run a compensation of knowledge will outperform a narrow minded person .i do n't agree with that statement .
[non-native] it is sometimes good to advertise the products more than they really are .
[native] ` expats ' is the term for rich , western , immigrants , whilst ` immigrants ' is the term for those that come from poorer countries .
[non-native] it should therefore be concluded , that it is only a matter of time for cars to decrease in number .
[non-native] hence , i come back to school and start to learn other academic subjects .
[non-native] we can say that there are diferents kinds of travels for example when yo want to travel with ypour family to know new things in this case the best thing taht you can do is travel in a big group let by a tour guide , becasue a tour guide is a person that know very well the place and he is going to carry you to the best places .
[native] i would say brussels felt most like home ; for a number of reasons .
[non-native] today we have many students who are very dull in their studies and they just memorise the answers and reproduce the same in the exam papers .
[native] yes , but from everything recorded about the life of christ he sounded like a decent person .
[native] i 'm all for that , but you need to consider that 79 % are unsure or disagree ... that is an overwhelming majority so its not currently possible in the slightest ...
[non-native] and above those three opinions ithere are some argument wether having broad knowledge of many academic subject or specializing in one object .
[non-native] indeed , i would first underline the fact that older people often - but not always - have something very precious that youngsters do not have : maturity .
[non-native] for example , in chemistry , we can do an experience , observe its , and then we have to understand the reaction .
[non-native] actually , freedom is much more dangerous for grown-up than for teenagers : parents are there to help and to rescue in case of emergency and there is little time when the dangers of freedom can be experienced .
[native] i 've also visited `` centre of europe '' monuments in slovakia and ukraine , and there are many others .
[non-native] the tour guide tries to show everything in a very short amount of time .
[native] yes , some of those athletes also did have phenomenal work ethics and huge cultural pressure too .
[non-native] this education policy ensures that the young people contribute enough time to helping their communities .
[native] on the other side are the people who are in it for the money : the politicians who are paid nearly 2x what barack obama is , the 30 000 corporate lobbyists , the graduate hires whose starting salaries are higher than investment bankers , the euro-funded `` ngos '' who pump out europhile propaganda etc.
[non-native] people know what is `` wrong '' to do in situations , and how not to fail again .
[non-native] i helped to give them warm lunch and dinner and i felt so good when i saw that the homeless people where happy about the meal and that they could laugh again .
[non-native] first of all we have to consider that there are a lot of countries that are in expansion , countries like china , india , brasil .
[native] this is what happens when you build a nation based on genocide .
[non-native] not only is the price of gasoline expensive but it is also destroying the atmosphere , resulting in global warming .
[native] the fall of singapore , like with australia , disillusioned a lot of new zealanders with our future in the commonwealth .
[native] most people are n't expecting to be a waiter for life at applebees - it serves as a nice stop-gap or temporary employment for students , young professionals or working parents who are n't available for 40 hours a week to work .
[native] there are a lot of brazilians i 've met in london with italian passports .
[native] when you hear `` neoliberal '' , what comes to your mind ?
[native] do you really think the world can afford to bail out a 2 trillion or 1 trillion euro economy ?
[non-native] they must be a little brave and learn from their own experience .there is a very popular saying in english which goes `` a jack of all trades is a master of none . ''
[non-native] they donot higher those individuals who have bit of knowledge in all fields but rather they prefer hiring those people who have specialised knowledge of the feild in which the company deals because these inidividuals who are masters in one subject will help in company ' s growth and development .
[non-native] if we compare this with young people than it is seen that young people programs are held twice in a year .
[native] you do n't have to acknowledge us but do n't you * dare * thumb your noses at us or the loss of futures and loved ones we 've gone through to get where we are today .
[non-native] successful poeple seem to try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
[non-native] so i hope that the umanity is not so stupid to loke more at the possesions , likes cars , than at the wealth .i really aggree with this statement .
[native] honestly parts of australia are n't bad , especially in coastal regions where you get a nice sea breeze , but when temperatures routinely reach 40 degrees celcius in summer , it 's too hot for me .
[non-native] the humanity is using up all the petrol ; planes , cars , boats , industries . ..
[non-native] first of all , students in their teens which mostly consist of middle and high school students do not and can not ( due to the limited time frame ) pay much attention to the community .
[native] one of these days i will wake up , check the news , and find footage of russia invading ukraine .
[non-native] that will encourage them to continue developing on that matter .
[native] you know how many more germans we killed as americans or japanese we killed than vice versa ?
[non-native] i wish the statement would have been true but my minds says `` in your dreams '' .
[non-native] many people think that it is better to study a very specific topic and hope to be accepted in a company that works with this field of knowledge , while other perople think that it is convenient to study as many different but related subjects so that his job will become easyer for him to do .
[native] most left wing parties are either opposed to the union altogether or are in favour of a looser confederacy .
[native] but i thought considering the language originates from long before the ottoman period and the writing system is different , that you would n't consider them all that similar .
[native] subsidiarity is not about power moving between different levels , it 's about determining where that power is best exercised .
[non-native] and this is continued by their sons mr. mukesh and mr. anil .
[non-native] first of all , it is important for a younger student to have a broad knowledge of many subjects .
[non-native] in order to keep profits on their previous high level , the producer will have to conduct research in order to invent and introduce new products ; that is , he will have to give up the familiar and try out something different .
[native] the language is actually not hard at all - i study it and find it easier than french , which i am also studying .
[non-native] in addition to that you are unique when you are an specialist .
[non-native] the product of course never crashes down , or is never used in a way where it would n't work as well as in the best conditions .
[native] ] ( http://rbth.com/business/2014/07/07/icao_recognizes_crimean_airspace_as_russian_37997.html ) - '' * in mid-march 2014 , ukrainian air traffic control services closed the airports in simferopol and sevastopol as well as lower airspace over crimea `` until further notice '' .
[non-native] naturally people will be discouraged to use cars not only because of the high running costs ( we should not forget the rising fuel prices ) but also the maintenance cost .
[non-native] i agree with the statement in the above the reasons .i agree with the statement that young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
[non-native] since science and technology requires invention you have to study a lot you have to take some risks .
[native] georgian women were world champions in the 80 's with chiburdinidzi and gaprindashvilli ( apologies for spelling ) .
[native] favourite cities i 've lived in : bratislava , prague , krakow favourite cities to visit : l'viv , tallinn , lisbon , sibiu , bern , wrocÅaw , olomouc , ljubljana
[native] sinn fein supporters tend to be unwelcoming towards immigrants .
[native] here , `` our salespeople are not paid on commission '' is a selling point for some stores .
[native] we normally get on well with scandinavians , these days .
[non-native] i agree with both of the points to some extent .
[non-native] if one wants to succeed , the ability and braviation of trying new things and taking risk is necessary .many people belive that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
[non-native] i think it will be much more convenient for those people who do wo n't use their car and for those who still have their cars , because there will be less traffic and less parking problems .nowadays , most people generally spend a lot of time in their company for their work in daytime .
[non-native] also , older people may be less flexible and less open to change even if it is for their own good .
[native] the cepr , one of the most respected international think tanks in the world , has found that the net effect of the ttip will be that between .2 % and .5 % of the eu workforce will find * better * jobs than they had before ( moving from simple work like steel manufacturing , to auto manufacturing for example ) and not that jobs will be lost .
[non-native] their interest is only focused on their own success not on their communities .
[non-native] for instance , in economics , there are lots of facts concerning the way unemployed agents behave when they try to get information about vacant jobs .
[native] one thing different with oligarchs is that generally , the ceo of a corporation is n't an insanely influential guy , but the corporation as the sum of its management , workers , especially shareholders etc is a super formidable force , probably more influential than eastern europe oligarchs .
[non-native] because the advertisements make the product seem like a magical , the consumers will buy the prodcuct , profitting the company .
[non-native] i recall happiness as a kid as more immediate , combined with less awareness of such a state of emotion , while happiness today is often something i register while enjoying it .
[native] i 'm done trying to engage people in discussion here .
[native] when people ask a question , and you reply with `` your mom '' then your opinion should be taken as worthless because you are either a ) a child 2 ) an idiot 3 ) a stupid child either way , not worth any more of my time .
[native] considering legislation must pass parliament and the council as well , that is hardly supreme per se .
[non-native] but both ca n't work separately : we need comon knowledge to learn how to take a decision and how to behave in society .
[non-native] it gives me more fun and opportunity for learning and experience .modern age has a powerfull impact on a person 's life .
[non-native] if we can not speak to other people in the language it is useless at
[non-native] the public transportation vehicles may go more places than they go now .
[native] yea , i see where it comes from but i can also see where shit and piss come from .
[native] american troops will remain , thankfully , in afghanistan however .
[native] why would the uk be more of a usa satellite than it is now if it left the eu ?
[native] examples : one study [ indicates that up to 600,000 jobs will be lost in the eu as a direct result of ttip ] ( http://ase.tufts.edu/gdae/policy_research/ttip_simulations.html ) a recent [ review of ttip studies ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/regdata/etudes/etudes/join/2014/528798/ipol-join_et ( 2014 ) 528798_en . pdf ) by the european parliamentary research service states : > * `` the regulatory core of ttip makes it extremely difficult for economists to come to grips with the expected economic meaning of the negotiation outcomes .
[non-native] of course there 's people meant to be inventors like edison or da vinci .
[native] eh , no , euros are n't worth quite as much as pounds , i 'd notice the difference .
[non-native] after school , i have activities that i would like to do such as volleyball for every monday , wendseday and friday , math team for every thurseday and model united nation for every tuesday .
[non-native] how do you know that everyone know you is a successful person , they will just think that you do n't know the question so you are not able to tell them .
[non-native] but people are easily influenced by what we see , and it effects on what we think about the food .
[non-native] cars are getting cheaper , and i believe that this trend will continue .
[non-native] for instance , cinema was n't invented by one person .
[non-native] besides enjoying different activities , the feeling of happiness or joy itself has evolved .
[native] no , but it seems true that we do n't we tend not to see people catching foreign spies trying to assassinate people after the cold war .
[non-native] for a example , young people play with their friends and they also know about where to play and which was the best time or place .
[native] but nato is the only one who deserves unshaking support in such a scenario .
[native] sinn fÃ©in did help with the gfa , but they were involved in controversial things afterwards , such as that pira kangaroo court in 2000 for that woman that was raped and other women that were raped .
[non-native] young people , these days are misleaded about the importance of the communities and their uses .
[native] you sort of have to accept it , unless you build a time machine .
[non-native] it may appear as a risk to teh watcher but for a successful person it is the divine pleasure of learning .
[native] the more the world makes fun of putin and ridicules him the more his actions are viewed as being `` truly russian '' and uncompromising to the whims of the west .
[non-native] the world will reject them and it will bee waste of time for them .for the following reasons , i disagree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
[non-native] when cars appeared , this phenomenon actually spread until today , so that the situation is rather critical nowadays .
[non-native] because of these successful persons we are able to see refrigerator , micro owen , television , computer , aeroplane etc .
[native] [ well there were reports of him having cancer .
[native] is there a set list of things the uk and denmark can opt out of , or can they just opt out of any new eu agreement ?
[non-native] they may be made to lure the people for purchasing the product but may be educative and of help too .
[non-native] for example , i had a trip two years ago with a group and i learned alot from them talking about their countries and the best places they saw in other trips .
[native] and to reiterate , all completely in line with what i 've been telling you guys about the ttip and isds for months in the face of heavy downvotes .
[non-native] i have to say , regardless of the weird obsession my parents have for guides , i agree with them .
[native] ukraine is under the exact same shit they were before , except now this guy just put his chips in with someone else and russia just raised the stakes .
[non-native] furtheron , i believe that today the economy is increasing at such a fast pace that there is no shortage of money , that people can not buy a car .
[native] it 's not rewarding or punishing economic policies because they 're * proportionate * .
[native] > i think the uk , the eu , and trucidator will be doing exactly what they were going to do all along .
[non-native] keeping same way and insisting in doing things old fasion way can not be a key for success .
[non-native] also , having more times ables travelling members to make more memories .
[native] it 's fine to be concerned ( maybe you do n't like american foreign policy , or capitalism in general ) , but framing it as an `` assault on democracy '' is pretty dumb .
[non-native] even though there are still a couple of problems to solve these new techniques may one day , lead to much more economic cars or maybe even total independence of the world 's petrol ressources .
[non-native] a good example could give some light to this point .
[non-native] when i look around and observe people from different ages all around me , i can see that they love to do different things and they enjoy different things but they can still enjoy .
[native] ... and in other news [ ikea are going to sell solar panels ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1nfthi/swedish_flatpack_furniture_giant_ikea_will_start/ ) which wo n't help at all unless the sun shines during the ad breaks .
[non-native] every apartments looked to me great from their web page .
[native] i would love to move to estonia , but the migration restrictions seem so harsh ( something like only 1000 allowed into tallinn/year ) , and they do n't have any work for non-estonian speakers in my field .
[non-native] the second important reason is , population around the woprld is increasind and they need the cars .
[non-native] in my opinion , what they should do is to review if and gain satisfactory from it instead of looking forward .
[native] > only drink the 3.5 % fat milk master race eww ... :p
[native] saying `` ergo merkel '' makes me happy for some reason .
[native] marriage can be about love , but there are good reasons to marry for financial incentives and stuff .
[non-native] we had many cultural and histrical questions about this country , but we could n't get an answer .
[native] australia is [ significantly more male ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/australian_ogre_1900.jpg/800px-australian_ogre_1900.jpg ) .
[native] it 's the fasted growing city in the country .
[native] you ca n't find cheaper parts at a car wreckers yard ?
[native] the eu 's major economies have stalled , forecasts are bleak , and the populations of southern and eastern europe and germany are actually in decline !
[non-native] even they can do anything like naughty things in classes to enjoying parties with friends .
[non-native] in conclusion , i think that young people can enjoy life more than old people .
[non-native] but in all , success can not be based only on whether a person takes risks or not .
[native] the guy who has heroically murdered hundreds of thousands of his own people , tortured school children and caused a civil war for the last three years just because he did n't want to have free elections .
[native] lol , nothing changed since the middle ages than , my condolences ( isolation hurts some countries ) as we speak .
[non-native] moreover , in the current society , the old are not viewed as they used to .
[native] it 's be really great if their criticism was based in some kind of reality or nuance , but sadly it 's not .
[native] > people are concerned about the secretive nature of the negotiations , however , ignoring that all fta and investment treaties are negotiated under such conditions , and also by the isds provisions .
[non-native] several years ago , i went to austarila for traveling by myself .
[non-native] each person is different and it 's the beauty of the life !!!
[non-native] in addition , the tour assistants show famous spots for sightseeing ,
[native] the 2022 bid was proposed by the german olympic committee , and a referendum was held in november last year with the citizens voting against it .
[native] http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/ukraine-russland-schickt-offenbar-panzer-nach-westen-a-1001687.html spiegel has it but again just repeating what nato has said .
[non-native] he can decide to become a painter instead of a accountant .
[native] lovely maps , i think it would be interesting to add a third map that gave the debt per capita as a % of average income , as average income does n't equal gdp per capita .
[non-native] if you are really brilliant in math , physics , geography , history and religion it would be hard to find a job where you can improve all your knowledge .
[non-native] student can prepare for future when they are school student and child .
[native] because at least in cities there 's a shit ton of people in most of the bars , and they all want beer and most of them will tip or have boobs .
[native] most big powers do n't go in and commit mass murder against doctors , engineers , officers , lawyers , and anyone else that can stand up to them .
[non-native] to sum up , given these reasons that are discussed above , i strongly commit to the notion that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .technology is going on increasing day-by-day and many of the people are not getting stick to one thing .
[native] euroscepticism is surely a symptom rather than a cause of problems in europe .
[non-native] there are three major explanations for this rapid increasem : `` the decrease in the cost of making cars , the population growth and the overal recovery in people 's financial situatuion around the world . ''
[non-native] so in my opinion the advertisements are sophasticated sources which seems to make products better than they are actually .the author 's assertion that - `` it is more important to understand the concepts and ideas rather than learn facts '' , i partially agree with the saying .
[native] without an unsustainable credit boom somewhere , the world economy seems incapable of generating growth in demand sufficient to absorb potential supply .
[non-native] from these two reasons , i think it is better to have a wide-ranged knowledge .do young people not give enough time to helping the communities they belong ?
[native] it has 10-minute newsflashes every hour or so :p the documentaries are pretty awesome though ; way better than junk like discovery channel .
[non-native] another reason , to have fewer driving cars on the planet in twenty years , will be the , already excisting , high polution .
[native] they also burnt lord nelson the year i last went , how much more of a national symbol do you want ?
[native] that would be like me coming to your house , declaring that `` this is my bedroom and all adjoining rooms are also mine '' and then claim that you started the war by trying to kick me out of your house .
[native] nature 's fireworks are spectacular , lifebringing , and beautiful !
[native] the amount of chips he 's winning with the obviously poor hand he 's been dealt is amazing .
[native] it would n't matter if we were in the middle of world war 3 , the actions of the israeli government , primarily in palestine , are not and never have been defensive actions .

[native] i presume you can link to that discussion then ?
[native] i see these kind of statements as a sign that putin might ease off the pressure and will try to find another way to get control of ukr without outright invasion .
[non-native] tuition fee is extremely high today , young people have to earn more money to pay .
[non-native] who work in the advertising field know how to advertisement a product .
[non-native] ghandhi for one an established lawer in south africa when he started his new non violent ways of protesting againest the harsh authorities .
[native] everyone is scared of `` geopolitical movements '' ; especially big scare is `` cooperation '' of alternative to the west governments ... fiasco in the making ;)
[non-native] in every sport , you spend the main part of your time training in order to be successful at the next competition .
[non-native] i can give you an example which i experienced myself .
[non-native] understaing ideas are very valualbe for students to learn .
[native] i think there will be a system that will allow for you to remain without too much hassle .
[non-native] the advertisement is to have show about items or things such as house , land , workers by televisions , newspapers and magazines or even through internet .
[native] my comment has been that the ` german model ' of enforcing fewer hours on workers and subsidising labour has helped all europeans , not just rich ones with influcence .
[native] con-artists and wife stealers ... so basically italians minus the pizza , right ?
[non-native] it may lead to financial issues with your bank .
[non-native] all depends on everyone 's personaity , mental and physical situation .
[non-native] although the sense of community service has decresed to some extent among the young people , the number of people who conciously take up community service has not decreased .
[native] can governments make laws that actively harm people and their interests and provide no tangible benefit because they 're ` political decisions ' ?
[non-native] to recall of my school days , my professor was always teaching the student about the main key ideas to approach to the main problems , the facts .
[non-native] if i finish my works to do new things perfectly , i would feel sense of achievement and exhausted .
[non-native] indeed most of these people have risked a lot to become what they are now .
[non-native] in the last fifteen years several customers association are born to to contrast every form of unreal illegal advertisements .i deeply agree that undestanding ideas is very much decisive than learning facts .
[native] i ca n't believe putin can just say : `` who are those soldiers restoring order to crimea , brave men indeed ! ''
[native] ** edit : ** [ for those looking for the english version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqxy0gula3u )
[native] thats so wrong , hungarians are pro west and they dont like russia any more than any other country thats been impoverished in the past by russia .
[native] how about i go down the `` grow the fuck up who cares what they call themselves '' road .
[native] [ they lost , and canada remained a british territory ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_of_1812 )
[native] also , ` halloween '' and all saint 's day is the same thing : * all hallowed 's eve * is actually just the old tradition of a holy day starting at sunset the night before , rather than sunrise in the morning .
[non-native] first , one ca n't deny that young people are healthy and it makes their every-day-life easier than for older people : less sleeping problems , many outdoors activities offered , etc .
[native] i hate to link it , but check out the [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/methylcyclopentadienyl_manganese_tricarbonyl ) to show that it 's not considered bad .
[native] the people notoriously do not know what 's good for them .
[native] * controversy continues around the introduction of water charges with [ thousands of people out on the streets of limerick during the week .
[native] as with most of the rest of the last 300 years of british history , the tories are going to be in charge , with some episodes of liberals or the labour party .
[non-native] hence i strongly agree with the people who try to invent new things .
[non-native] for this statement , i have two specific reasons .
[native] the 5th column would also relate to so-called `` counterrevolutionaries '' like anarchists , left communists and trotskyists who opposed stalin 's rule , as seen in the [ show trials which were endorsed by western observers ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moscow_trials ) as well as any old bolsheviks that presented any threat .
[non-native] then , people started to realize how they have been doing something wrong .
[native] if a parent wants their child circumcised they can wait till the kid is 18 and let him make up his own mind .
[non-native] we use so much of this right now that it might not be available in the next decades .
[non-native] so we can not say youn people enjoy life more than older people and we can not say older people enjoy life more than young people .
[non-native] but it is true that , at the same time , runing cars is becoming very expensive .
[native] it 's a holdover from wwii rationing , i believe .
[non-native] another way to justify my point of view is that making products seem much better than they really are is consubstancial to the purpose of advertisements .
[non-native] in conclusion , i believe that enjoyment of life is not a factor of someone 's age but instead a factor of the activity which defines ` enjoyment ' to a particular person .
[non-native] if students just understant the ideas and concepts escept the facts , they wil do not know change when they meet the new facts .
[non-native] in fact , it 's just a simulation that does n't garantee in any way such a result .
[native] people forget that nuclear weapons are real , that nuclear holocaust is horrible , and that russia is n't the soviet union .
[native] statements like this help no one not only do they piss off sweden but it will also detract from israels arguments against recognizing palestine as the media will be concentrating on this comment instead .
[non-native] the knowledge that is created by media hides a secret way of capturing a readers ' attention .
[non-native] to start with , when travelling to the place we do not know individually not using the tour guide , we may wonder where to go and what to do .
[native] the holocaust * would * have been an internal matter , as other pogroms were , or the armenian genocide .
[native] > the uk committee the article does n't mention a uk committee , it was agreed upon by the manufacturers themselves so the german manufacturers outvoted him and he 's accusing the commission of rubber-stamping it .
[native] i 'm saying he had the necessary knowledge to negotiate how this might be paid much earlier but chose not to .
[native] as far as we are concerned the gfa and subsequent referendum was us telling the north to fuck off and sort their shit out by themselves .
[non-native] on the other hand , people who avoid changing and stick to what they now best are not candidates for success .
[non-native] in a word , successfull people take risks and try new procedure to improve their way of doing things .personally i feel that it is better to specialize in one specific subject rather than having broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
[non-native] i agree the statement that explained here which is relevant with my friend .the question being asked is whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to rather specialize in one specific subject .
[non-native] for example , the recent young people have to study from the morning to the midnight every day .
[non-native] if i were someone who knows only chemistry and has no intimate knowledge of other academic fields , people with whom i can make friends would be only someone like me who is a glutton of chemistry .
[native] even english speaking children have problems with english pronunciation .
[non-native] it is also very risky for any individual to keep specializing in one field without knowing the scope and growth of that particular field .
[non-native] on the other hand it is actually a very unstable building .
[native] it 's just so bizzare ; there are the eurovision staples of randomly shouted german numbers and mangled english , all sung by cross-dressing tinfoil men .
[native] we just never went back or reintroduced the tradition of making good coffee .
[non-native] of course they did n't mention such problems in advertising spots nor will they ever do .
[native] generally it would be the opposite , ranging from novel intrigue to not giving a hoot .
[non-native] secondly , the community in which the young people live is also an important factor .
[native] ww2 would have never happened if ww1 never happened .
[native] actually , it depends on what is good for society .
[non-native] i think young people enjoy life more than older people .
[non-native] or even if the return is possible , it would not be in the manner we would like it to be .
[non-native] it is quite relevant in the education of a country , and about it and its consequences a huge controversia has been opened at the spannish university .
[native] to be fair , your welfare system is pretty brutal .
[non-native] as they have limited knowledge , they refer the patients with cardiac problem to the cardiologist , who always has better knowledge of heart activities than them .
[non-native] newspapers , magazines , posters , tv and radio advertisements will try to do their best in this competitive world market .
[non-native] when ther people know this the people change the type of yours live , i think that thay continus to buy a car , is important , i think that there is one car for any family . .
[non-native] in fact this will increase the the general information about many thing in the life .
[non-native] phylosophy , which is the science of concepts is based on example and thus on facts .
[native] and yet , aje has an amazing journalistic streak and calls out corruption and oppression in many of their pieces .
[non-native] the student might know that there is a fact of ` gravity ' , but if he also knows how isaac newton has found it , which thinking ways he tracked and reached this solution , he will have the ambition to go further and try to create concepts of his own .
[non-native] he is japanese who i met in new york .
[non-native] people would live in the streets , and there wo n't be any street except a sandy dirty place .
[native] well it should n't complicate your life too much .
[native] nz is lower than australia on average , with sydney having a terrible housing bubble that 's similar to london prices .
[non-native] the new projects may or may not do well and the company might run into losses .
[native] speaking in terms of `` annexation '' and `` occupation '' makes absolutely perfect sense .
[non-native] so i would need to spend a lot of time for example , on a programming language and learn it to the best of my abilities .
[native] of course , what really makes people feel worse about crimea than guantanamo ( at least in the us ) , is that the people who are in crimea are all just regular people .
[non-native] indeed , in every countries , the citizens have polluted their beaches , their plains , their air etc .
[native] tasmania has a similar climate to us i believe .
[non-native] younger people do not enjoy life more than older people do , they just enjoy it in a diferent way .
[native] if the proposed reforms result in a default or exit from the euro zone , then members who are in the common currency lose out .
[non-native] for example , it is very easy to go from the house to the destinaion for children and disabled people especially .
[native] that was n't a reasonable comment in the slightest , it was a series of unqualified eurosceptic talking points .
[non-native] the low amount of customers that read this information stroke me .
[non-native] at the end i want say that don ` t exist any person that became important limiting himself , but to become successful people need courage and to take difficult choise to improve more and more .for some people , you will suceed in your life just by taking risks .
[native] i realise that those were just a few people , and that shitty ones are in the extreme minority .
[non-native] may be they value more passive activities like reading books and being intellectual more than during their childhood , which does not imply that they are less satisfied with their lives .
[non-native] another reason for most advertisements to show only good parts of the product is that if the advertisement shows the reality of the products , customers are not going to buy it , and producers will not be able to make a profit .
[native] i 'm currently doped-up to heck on cold-and-flu drugs so i 'm just gon na flat-out ask you to explain some things to me : > â¢ ireland unit labour costs are competitive with germany 's and the euro is therefore not overvalued vis-a-vis ireland .
[native] even if you never intend to come to ireland it is still worth getting as an irish passport will allow you to travel to may countries much easier than a us passport e.g.
[non-native] so , she failed the test and then she had to prepare another exam .
[non-native] so , most of his time has been spent in accomplishing his goals and supporting the family .
[non-native] guides can even be quite interfering , poking their noses unecessarily in other people 's affairs , or one might feel restricted to his whims and fancies .
[native] this is wrong , catalan is a gallo-romance , not ibero-romance
[non-native] then , you might start researching what the fact is .
[non-native] i agree with the people who are succesful in doing the thingss ang got succeded in different aspects , will automatically tend to try to do new things , its all depends on his ability to do and way of approaching ideas in doing that thing .
[non-native] population would as usual continue to rise unless a major catastrophe occurs .
[native] i think that it would too hypocritical for podemos ( which seems to draw it 's appeal from that fact that it 's not either of the main parties ) to make a deal with either the pp or the psoe .
[native] do n't you have anything better to do on a friday night than argue with me about stupid bullshit .
[non-native] indeed , you can discover that thanks to this , the world is full of controversions and different things .
[non-native] for those people who are still going to elementrary school , they do n't even know what their life will be like .
[native] if we are so concerned about people getting recruiting from the west into groups like isis , we should also be concerned about people getting recruiting into neo-nazi fighting battalions .
[non-native] now we know that , the advertisements are not the most reliable tools to refer when deciding on what to buy .
[non-native] this works , and it works good .being able to speak about everything , even just a little , is a very attracting idea .
[native] bickering aside , i 've heard very good things about belfast .
[non-native] and the study about hybrid cars or new furuel must be more increased in many countries with their own nature resources .
[non-native] hence the successful people are the who are ready to take the risks and they know how to face the risks rather than doing that of the previous work in a better way .
[non-native] the only challenging point of view is the duration of the `` petrol era ' .
[non-native] another reason for my belief is , due to fact that unemployment is decreasing , contury 's economic level will increase .
[native] i do n't care that tim cook is gay .
[non-native] in twenty years , cars will stilll be in use , but surely as not as much as it is now .a number of people maintain that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
[native] i 'm beginning to think that it is important to have a core export base and attempt to create an environment where as many other industries can ` feed ' off it as possible .
[native] i do n't know , surely the blind are the easiest to hide things from .
[non-native] many experts say that a lot of mass media such as televisions and newspapers are responsible for this .
[native] * ** restaurants ** - 20 % is pretty much standard .
[non-native] every new technology is created by taking risks and trying new things .
[non-native] in order to make the trip better , it is better to traval by my own plan without a tour guide .in my opinion succesfull people ca n't be mesured by the quantity of risks they take , because a man that does not take any risk and focuses on doing what he knows he does very well , can be as succesful as a man that focuses only in taking risks and trying to experiment with new thing everyday .
[non-native] the young people nowadays are lacking the sense of helping .
[non-native] on a trip i made to europe two years ago ( obviously with every member of my family ) , i went to see a city that hundreds of years ago had been covered in lava , and completely destroyed .
[non-native] by cost of driving , i am chiefly refering to the cost of petrol .
[non-native] as a matter of a conclusion , in the future there will be fewer cars because people will try to travell in a fastest and confortable way than in a car and also be concerning about helping and not contaminating the environment .i think that this is a generalization of the young word , and so i think that it is not a true statement .
[native] not really , i just find it funny people defend their own crazy elite but get mad at others
[non-native] some said that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
[native] someone posted this screenshot on boards.ie ( one of the largest forums in ireland ) and now the embassy is claiming that they 're taking legal proceedings against boards.ie .
[native] i 'm sceptical they 'll win , but they have a case to make , and regardless i do n't think they even intend to win - rather , whilst australia is bogged down in negotiations , other countries will refrain from implementing plain packaging themselves ( ireland , for example , appears to be waiting on the verdict before implementing their version of the law ) .
[non-native] i feel tour groups led by tour guides are important , but it depends on travellers discreation to decide if it is the best way to travel .
[native] > many of your responses to posters came down to `` we do n't know anything for sure yet , we should n't discuss speculations '' which i found rather ironic .
[non-native] because knowledge of many academic subjects include in important .
[native] calling back the french that i learned in school a decade and a half ago when i was 14 : `` je voudrais acheter un pain '' ... wait , conjugation ... `` je veux acheter un pain '' ... now `` un '' sounds wrong .
[non-native] i disagree with statement because i think people try new thing have lot of avantages than only doing what they already know how to do well because when you try a thing likes cloth or shoes they can see if it 's good or not and if it is their size .
[non-native] however i think that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
[non-native] in the following essay , i will defend my opinion with pertinet reasons and illustrative examples .
[non-native] it is easy to forget that the x was squared or that what a certain letter meant .
[native] commissioners are nominated by democratically elected parliaments of states , and then must be approved by the democratically elected european parliament .
[native] why not have canada start supplying gas and oil .
[non-native] from my personal experience , one of my friends , soccer player , who well knows only about soccer , always used to talk about soccer .
[non-native] when he was 70 year old , we was rich man again .
[native] i question the glossy nature of it all , the fact that they are all wearing mass produced identical clothing kind of reeks to me of some other party looking to piggy back off the scottish independence bid .
[native] and when russia took crimea and the west did n't lift an eyebrow , ukraine should have started negotiations then instead of waiting 2-3 months for turmoil to ferment in the east because they are not living in reality .
[native] the nato infliltration is fading and euro wants it 's old throne back ...
[non-native] and because of this young generation is not able to give enough time to their community .
[non-native] this is not really good public relations for your company .
[native] this is the face of the right-wing in poland .
[non-native] there are some points to disagree the the topic but can be neglected .
[native] we 're loyal british subjects , so we are , and proud to serve her majesty .
[non-native] therefore , i think older people shoul enjoy life more than young people do .the issue at hand is young people enjoy life more than older people do or not .
[native] > that chart says that just italy and germany alone have created 1 million jobs look again at the italian figures .
[native] just trying to explain why some would be against it .
[non-native] when the advertisement looks very appealing , people get interested in it .
[native] but there has n't been something like this happening in a long time so people are very quick to whitewash them .
[non-native] being good in multiple subjects such as finance and strategic management will allow a management consultant to give advice taking multiple scenarios into consideration .
[non-native] first , to succed you need to take risks .
[native] if they had n't been sent to russia they would have been sold off by now to whatever tin-pot dictator who had the cash to bribe them .
[non-native] lastly , in twenty years time , there will be a new transport that will provide better services to human life than cars will .
[native] all the teams at my work are kind of taking on a team to support during the rugby world cup .
[native] just something for people to keep in mind when weighing opinions .
[native] the information and ideas about germany of the world wars era was still being researched and revised well into the 90 's .
[native] i skimmed through it and got the idea that they dislike the current israeli prime minister but that 's far from saying they would n't mind palestine being recognised as an official state thus this trickles down into ireland which like i said before does a lot to please american multi nationals so its unlikely ireland will be next just from my own experience of how anything is dealt with in this country
[native] [ here ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/visa_requirements_for_british_citizens.png ) is also an interesting map of the places we can already visit visa free anyway , whether the uk stays in the eu or leaves it , can we just be friends ?
[native] classical music ( and that 's individuals , not the nation ) and dashcam videos .
[native] actually , polls show that support for same sex marriage in the us is equal amongst whites and hispanics .
[non-native] i am perfectly aware of how difficult is to handle this problem , since my 15-year-old brother has plenty of time and although both me and my parents keep constantly encouraging him to do something for others , it has really no effect .
[non-native] they do not have time to involve in the activities that help their communities .
[non-native] they simply say that we dont know , and they didnt even try for the answer .
[non-native] to have various knowledge may provide me to communicate with people easily .
[native] i 've never had that issue unless it 's a major film on opening night .
[non-native] when you see the advertisment of product that you want to buy , it seems nice to you .
[native] the rest of the uk has the right to campaign for their continued stay in the union .
[non-native] in conclusion , understanding ideas and concepts is better and more important for students oweing to that they can use their knowedge , become creative and feel joy when they study .
[native] one way to achieve this in the uk would be to make the various national assemblies into houses of parliament , and then create a structure of special legislative procedures and devolved parliaments composed of the appropriate houses of parliament for handling the ordinary legislation of the central and member governments .
[native] the uk is economically , politically , diplomatically , culturally and militarily much more important to the eu than turkey is .
[native] it 's easy to make someone look a dick when you cut their quote in half is n't it ?
[non-native] of course some things ` have ' to be vistited but in every country are several unknown places which are at least as remarkable although they do not appear in every tourist information book .
[non-native] maybe u have not the same energy as u were young but now u have more reasson to fell happy .
[native] > unless you think that the majority of the world 's population sees no difference between a foreigner and a person from their own country ?
[non-native] a person has to decide as to what he is aiming at , and start working towards his aim by taking a specialization in that subject .
[non-native] new things means new lives and new beginning , and risks refers to the awards you will get .i do not agree with the statement .
[native] there is a great deal of internal division within the wessex regionalist movement .
[non-native] so the students can know the fact whenever they want because understanding ideas pass the people to the facts .
[non-native] i hardly imagine that dhirubhai ambani would have been anything but a tea stall owner if he had n't dared to try his hand at something new .some people say that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing whar they already know how to do well while other people disagree .
[non-native] because it says only positive things , and successful stories , people who are suffering or wanting to try the products are willing to try the product .
[native] well if tanks crossing the border are true , it looks like he truly just does n't give a shit about his people .
[non-native] so probably young people in general have n't lot of time to helping their comunity , but they are interested in doing this , and someone of them choose helping people as the main activity of their life .in ancient korea , there was country called cho-sun .
[native] the united kingdom leaving solidifies germany 's position as hegemon of the european union .
[native] most people just ca n't comprehend that cultures are different .
[non-native] in my opinion this would not be interesting for a successful person because these people want to be more and more successful in there work and every part in there life .
[native] there 'll be enough , it 's a supply driven boom .
[native] because the argument i feel i presented and the point i was trying to make and what you just threw back at me and said i was trying to say are so different i 'm not even sure if you read my comment .
[native] yet , without good proxies of those costs and the scope for their reduction , an empirical economic analysis with proper modeling is basically impossible or mere sophisticated ` guess ' work . '' * john hilary of war on want - [ analyzing the cepr study ] ( http://www.thebrokeronline.eu/blogs/employment/ttip-don-t-mention-the-job-losses ) : . . > * `` at least 1.3 million european workers will lose their jobs as a direct result of the agreement .
[non-native] the dancers are tend to choreograph their favorite genre .
[native] tisa mode four will really be a radical change .
[non-native] i also think that with a guide i might not feel insecure and worried about losing my way or wasting my time looking at inappropriate sites or even .
[non-native] also because long-distance communications throughout usa may be really good , but that is not the case when it comes to short distances .
[non-native] seeing all this i then too disagree with the statement because the advantages of fact carry much more weigh than understanding ideas .according to my opinion , schools should be the places where students are thought and made understood the ideas and concepts .
[native] also the senate must approve presidential cabinet positions and supreme court justices .
[non-native] it is well known that the thieves usually attact the people alone , which situation is eaier for them .
[native] did you miss the sentence above where i said i live in poland ?
[native] i find it easier to read it as if it were latin , not spanish , especially the `` sunt '' and `` cÃ¢ÈtigÄm ''
[non-native] as a consequence of this , the firms need to diversify their products among others and they make use of the advertisements .
[non-native] that is why they tell you `` if you call within the next 2 minutes you will get a bonus pack '' , this way they get the attention of the person , by making them think they are getting not only the fabulous product , but also the amazing bonus pack , distracting them from the real product .
[non-native] i would rather keep improving things i am good and skilled at than trying a variety of experiences because it is wasting time and could harm myself .
[non-native] people tend to add to some thoughts in their own way on the fundamental , facts .
[non-native] even they already accomplish something , they have to more try to get new ones for poor people .
[non-native] lets take david beckham 's perfume advertisement for exampe .
[native] > so you want spain to feed off catalonia 's resources against catalonia 's will ?
[native] barcelona is my favourite european city that i 've been to though , it has much more of a heart than paris imo .
[native] then you 're stuck out of the eu with a bunch of lunatics in charge .
[non-native] everytime i would list all the things i need in my notebook .
[native] in my view , by trying harder to integrated them into the mainstream , you 'll do a much more effective job of preventing or dealing with this issue , than by just trying to `` catch the baddies '' like every retarded politician has been going on about .
[native] if they are , that sounds like something that needs to be dealt with through mental health care , not by making not-working particularly unpleasant .
[native] the only reason their husbands allow them to go out in public is because they can wear a burqa .
[native] if by `` native anatolians '' you mean the hittites or earlier - we 're talking the very dawn of civilisation here - they 're not known to have ever been at byzantium .
[native] i 'm not an expert or anything but i do n't see russia lasting more than 20-25 years at this point .
[native] i do n't understand that ; the legality of it is a key part of the issue and explains every participants actions .
[native] and that 's just the reality , in my opinion , which many people do n't want to acknowledge .
[non-native] some student will work more harder in understanding the fact an some will not .
[native] you always reduce my points to stupid shit i never said like calling ukrainians sub human .
[native] personally , i think that things should change in guantanamo , and that these people should get their day in court .
[non-native] but i think a capable man can benifit from his wide interest , for his interest will finally help his to do achieve in his majorfirst , i must say i completely agree with the statment .
[non-native] for instance , according to the article , people found out rat in kfc chicken then they got serious disease for a year .
[native] all the top comments are anti-eu and anti-mass immigration .
[native] > it 's neither for you nor me to decide .
[non-native] people tend to study more in order to have the necessary knowledge to work and live in society .
[native] the one that i 've disproven because it does n't say lost , it says changed due to pull factors ( ie : people move onto other jobs because they 're ` pulled ' towards them because of better pay , conditions , etc ) .
[native] perhaps we need to restore order in the colonies ?
[native] you need to give them the social assistance necessary to keep them off the street so that they can effectively seek work .
[native] mother tongue primary schools are used in similar marginalised communities in new zealand , india and parts of africa .
[non-native] thus , the producer will have to decrease the sales price of his product if he still wants to sell it , and his profits will be reduced .
[non-native] and logiquely we understand that the experience play a great part in ower logic and comprehension , and you ca n't that understand you are ogliged to observe , work in it , or do an effort to obtain the factsthere are a lot of people all over the world to travel somewhre in a year .
[non-native] indeed , this type does not help us in our everyday life .
[native] could 've been somebody who looks like chris tucker , could 've been somebody who looks like jackie chan .
[non-native] and this research can be very important to society , leading to a better understanding of topics .
[non-native] finally ; considering everthing , as for me , young people enjoy life more than older people do .it is commonly known that young people do enjoy life more than older people do .
[non-native] additionaly it all should happen in an easy going way because no one wants to be stressed on his or her vacation .
[non-native] while a few decades ago events happened at a local and community level , the development of information and communication has led to an enlargement from a village community to a world community .
[non-native] they recently found out that batteries may explode causing damages to objects and injuries to persons which are close to such notebooks .
[non-native] the dedication of young people to community work may be less visible now then it was in former times .
[non-native] for example , a young student might think about sneaking to his father can and drive it without having a license .

[native] i was born in russia and came to the us as a kid in the 80s .
[native] a male who is lazy at work is looked down just as much as a female who does n't care for the family ; conversely stay-at-home dad is thought just as weird as work-centered mom .
[native] > very few parents of young children smoke where are you getting that data from ?
[non-native] you can remeber all the facts that you like , but if you had well understand concepts you will be able to recombine them in different and original ways .
[non-native] sesond , if student understand idea and concepts , they can imagine more idea nad concepts .
[native] we 're very similar to australia but with an added native flavour and slightly more anglophilia .
[non-native] a lot of people today prefer to use tram and bus to reach offices and other work stations .
[non-native] instead a person with a specialization have some problems if he find a work that he does not know well , he can be confused on what to do .
[native] [ here 's ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2jsqfv/what_is_so_great_about_ttip/clervs2 ) why isds is generally nowhere near as bad as it 's reported , and why they do n't sue just because of environmental regulations/what have you .
[non-native] moreover , today students at school are taught how to balance their academic and co-curricular activities .
[non-native] as a consequence , the society and even individual would lose many things and could not be happy .
[non-native] if the population decrease drastically , the amount of the cars will decrease .
[non-native] this is easier to explain when looking at music .
[native] i went to bulgaria in 2011 and the time i did n't spend in a drunken coma the country seemed poor , but not dirt poor .
[non-native] for starters , there has been a countinous increase in demand for cars since car was invented .
[non-native] but if we can overcome problems like cars with hydrogen engines exploding all the time and find out methods like how to generate energy from solar battery even if it is cloudy , then there could be many cars like now .
[native] would n't * that * be a fine thing .
[non-native] i feel how many years it go only the good product companies stay for long time .
[non-native] you will get boured very easly becaus there is no one to take with .
[native] i 'd be interested in seeing weather or not engagement is more popular among german youth then the old .
[non-native] first of all , the facts that we learn is usually has the some `` reasons '' why that facts occured .
[non-native] second , the statement seems right because there are some people who have become famous because of their new thinkings and tries .
[non-native] in twenty years we will have lots of new ideas and inventions thats for sure but we are going to face an absoloutly big problem with the anormous number of cars being used and produced , the way i see it is that if we go on like this we might not manage to last for long .
[native] the fuck is wrong with your country mate , sort it out , sort yourself out , and fuck off in justifying this bullshit yeah ?
[non-native] there is curious topic that young generation have more fun in life .
[native] one of them said that if they had amphibious assault ships they would 've been able to completely occupy georgia in 20 hours , as opposed to the five days it lasted .
[native] the ottomans were no worse than many other empires .
[non-native] to conclude , i would say that doing new things and taking risks is totally necessary for the individual to face the diferent sides of his personality , but they do not always match with being successful in the social meaninf of the word .the issue of knowing many academic subjects or to be specialized in a specific one is difficult to deal with .
[non-native] this aspect can not bew leaerned oput side should be made to lesrned in schooling stage itself .
[native] the www is information ( in the form of websites ) that is sent over this network .
[native] but i wanted to make the point that a nation = / = country .
[non-native] if i know a lot of topics , making a conversation is easily .
[non-native] first of all i have to say that i was born in this generation where the industry more or less can not survive without advertisements .
[non-native] thus , we should think about alternative solutions in order to come from one spot to another .
[non-native] when speaking in public or even when talkin amongst friends for that matter woud n't it be great if one was filled with academic knowledge and intellectual odassity ?
[non-native] advertisements use different ways to make the product very attractive .
[native] is there any patch of land better suited for other nations to fight their wars upon ?
[non-native] he will be more conscious of the subject , and thus will be able to explain it .
[non-native] till the time student wont understand the subject and wht he is studying that subject it is waste for any teacher to teach that subject to a student .
[non-native] it was understandable and give a mitivation to write a fugue .
[native] should we send them back to syria to keep fighting ?
[non-native] therfore , i could spend very peaceful time in japan .
[native] edit : historical reasons for secession are by far the weakest .

[non-native] one day his student discover the new chemical odd , he asked his teacher , his teacher told him the name of the chemical thing , this is a new discovery .
[native] being employed as a waiter is n't a human right , and if you are n't doing your job well i should n't have to reward shitty performance , especially since your entire job is making sure that the customer is happy .
[non-native] in a firm or in an association for instance , a person with a large knowledge is important to drive the whole structure toward the right way trying to define consistent decisions .
[non-native] to conclude , i strongly believe that as we make more and more progress in technology over the next few years the usage of the cars would increase significantly .the purpose of advertisements is to present a product or service in such a way that the consumers would want to have it , and have it immediately .
[native] on the other side , there are some good pro-consumer or anti-monopoly cases , shengen is * comfortable * .
[non-native] and on the other hand that a lot of young people whant to `` push '' society and there community forwards .
[native] then i clicked back ohhhh i 'm on / r/europe
[non-native] in conclusion , human have to more try to develope themselves .
[native] i 've always wondered , is there an isle of woman ?
[native] to be fair , st ives is n't bad in summer .
[native] if korea ever unified you could call korean a nationality .
[non-native] however , if you want to work in an organization , the personnel department checks whether we have diversified knowledge , so that we are such people who accept any kind of directions , which shows our flexible attitude .
[non-native] deviding jobs can make working professional and in this way , the effection will increase and the quality will also get higher , therefore , people can safe a lot of time and finish work well .
[native] lets get them both on camera and have them talk foreign politics .
[native] however , the exemption of churches and religious communities seems like a loophole .
[native] edit : it 's not the 10 newest members , but rather the 10 that joined in 2004 - that 's cyprus , czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia , and slovenia .
[native] as an example , let 's say the government passes a law that bans the use of a compound at over 50ppm ( parts per million ) .
[native] i think it is more likely that everyone feels offended , as they are lumped in with all the bad ones .
[native] if it were a person , it 's like being part of a family where you 're not allowed to stay out past 10pm or choose your own clothes .
[native] i want to bring up a point which is not discussed much here and i seem to be on the topic of corruption as well .
[native] i know pro-eu people like to think the opposition to their project is just a right wing fringe in the uk , but that 's not the case .
[native] the whole political landscape is dominated by foreign embassies and political scandals .
[non-native] for example , now i have studied at college .
[native] i do n't support the lack of due process at gitmo , but the us definitely does n't use it to arbitrarily detain people it does n't agree with .
[non-native] this issue is related with our great goal as humans , which is to care about sustainable developmenti would like to think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
[non-native] cars are an amazing invention but it can be a double edged weapon if the number encreases through the next two decades .there is a big gap between the generation of young and old people .
[non-native] if the generations such as the students only know the facts that who wins and lost in this war instead of trying to understand the meaning of the history , they will not gain what the ancestors left for us and what they really want us to learn from these experiences .
[native] however my point was that post war , hong kongers were finally treated as equals .
[native] it 's happening in the usa , too , you know ...
[native] traditional political parties are going to be bludgeoned over the head with the fact that they are going to have to engage people on their terms , over the internet .
[native] guy enters with knife , this guy grabs it resulting in cuts on hand .
[non-native] however he followed his dream and taking a great risk .
[native] as trotsky said , `` a rising of the masses requires no justification '' , and the hungarian revolution was a true rising of the masses .
[native] if they had murdered one of our own citizens , i 'm sure there would have been a bigger backlash .
[native] i think there was this period between 1950 and 1980 where everything ever built was fucking hideous .
[native] i would n't mind joining the eu , the biggest problem i would see is the switching of industry standards from an american system to the eu one .
[non-native] that could weaken one of the most powerful arguments not to drive cars with combustion engines : the limited petrol ressources .
[non-native] they usually use it to do some entainments , like see the movie or sing the song in the ktv with their classmates or friends .

[native] american [ born in the usa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzd4ezdbbu4 ) - bruce springsteen
[non-native] successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they know already how to do well .
[non-native] for example , some people might want to visit the bars or clubs of france whereas the others might want to visit the palaces and museums .
[non-native] soon i will finish the semister a which was just only included core subject and sub subject for those who had n't got good grade on the past ppublic exam .
[non-native] in the other hand , the group travel is financially worth , because sometimes paying for a group of people is entittled to a discount .
[native] it was meant to have a touch of humour , as all stereotypes usually do , unless they are meant to deliberately hurt someone , which none of mine are .
[non-native] i also learned the history their by reading the book .
[non-native] most of the advances are based on assumptions that one would succeed while attempting a particular task .
[non-native] and nature shows us the revenche with heavy rains or other extrem weather conditions .
[non-native] this is a problem which is always more frequent in the last time .
[non-native] do you know how discover the new america land ?
[non-native] it is possible to be part of a virtual community ( in chat rooms for instance ) without having to spend any time with the local community .
[native] [ quote from the op ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/2i9phd/parents_confront_head_at_birmingham_trojan_horse/cl0go7z ) : > i ca n't believe we 've gone from the nation that beat back the nazis to allowing these bastard invaders to dictate how our country is run :( i truly hate muslims , i hate what they 're doing to our countries .
[native] the problem is that the majority of people are not like you , and are not politically fluent in more than one country necessarily .
[native] social democracy accepts capitalism , with strict controls to prevent exploitation and market failure .
[non-native] there are thousands and thousands of products and services being promoted in advertisements .
[non-native] there was a saying that `` jack of all , master of none '' .this surely happen if person enters in to many academic .
[non-native] for example am i imagining a man who made billions of euro trough selling shoes .
[non-native] also the flights by planes are going to become more cheaper in the next twenty years and they will to cover more short distance lines , so an increasing number of people are going to use often the plane instead than cars .
[native] nope , the stance is '' * if crimea wants to be russian , they can go through the legal ukrainian process for doing so .
[non-native] in the third place , car 's running is depend on buring the oil whose price is in a growing number .
[native] i would n't call that being a `` europhile '' but yeah he 's not a eurosceptic either .
[non-native] so , when it comes to statistically comparing the number of individuals who on their own , take up community service of some kind or the other , there is no big change in the numbers .
[non-native] it grew rapidly due to creativity and innovative ideas which also involve considerable risk and questioning but payback is healthy and self satisfactory .
[native] after all the shit they have pulled in ireland , they have zero credibility , fake account my ass
[native] now that cameron has started to actually challenge it i predict the eu will `` back down '' .
[non-native] if you have knowledge in single subject , we ca n't under stand recent mathematics .
[native] well , you know , burning catholic effigies on large bonfires in front of cheering spectators and going around with signs saying `` no popery '' .
[native] i imagine a more practical solution is that the eu would still purchase the gas from russia , but transport/store it and purchase it on a european level and charge the member states for what they use to keep it revenue neutral .
[native] i do n't understand why he did n't just use dolmabace palace .
[non-native] first , traveling in a group led by a tour guide is safer than travel alone or without tour guide .
[non-native] not only can we develop out social skills , but our thoughts is getting bigger .
[non-native] mainly the students must know about the fact and he must understand the facts and then he must understand the concepts .
[non-native] there have been many researches to create new transportation which is better than car , and finally these days , these efforts are gaining their results .
[native] no , it 's just supposed to be polemical and entertaining .
[non-native] moreover , many of system of car are improved for people to use so easy and convinient , it can be said that more people want to have cars .
[native] the only reason google does it is for profit .
[non-native] in conclusion , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
[native] should they be considered `` treasonous '' as well ?
[non-native] and student could really be prepare and could really trust that they have a solid educational formation .
[native] well , if you really insist on having this argument , then the fact that renewables ( besides hydro ) are n't really baseload power generation , whilst nuclear is , so if a country is facing a shortfall in baseload then there might be some use for nuclear ?
[non-native] thirdly , older people with their experience and intelligence which grows with time know the proper defination of enjoyment .
[native] nope - both outcomes support the interests of various european oligarchs and both outcomes will be associated with eventual federalisation .
[non-native] i believe that experience is a key to success .
[native] either in `` western '' europe or the soviet bloc ?
[native] what you 're looking at is just a cheap building commissioned by british rail .
[non-native] thats why students perform good at this subjects must be learn facts like must to do labs in laboratorys .
[native] or posting that video again and again ... and again .
[non-native] and in the near future , i can not see any possibilities that cars number will be reduced .
[native] so you 're saying we should dump them in somalia like europe dumped it 's nuclear waste and so on ?
[native] i said nothing that pointed towards an ever growing population .
[non-native] to begin with , time is a unknown , or rather unpredicted , thing from past to today .
[non-native] on the contrary , news cars appear on the market all the time .
[non-native] however , i deeply consider that i face too much other difficulties that i have never met before or studed before such as how to connect with their parents effectively or how to reduce my personal anger when i come in class .
[native] the soviets had no business interfering in the political process of any country in the defense of it 's so-called `` revolution '' , just as the russians today , or any other country on this planet has business interfering in any other part of the world in order to enforce its interests and safeguard its `` values '' .
[native] maybe you 're right , maybe all these tabloids have a scoop that no other serious publications are picking up on .
[native] relying on family or a romantic partner is much more common .
[native] this could happen with a hugely uneducated populace who consistently vote poorly .
[non-native] nobody can succeed if he knows only a restricted source of information .
[native] post cold war foreign policy in the us is almost completely unrecognizable from cold war foreign policy .
[native] i do n't know , it 's something around lines of that ... or who knows , there are people who wank it to pics of clouds and mountains .
[non-native] there are a white fogs and moving something and other good food in addition to the food on tv .
[non-native] for example , a person who has little income which barely afford his or her family take time to help the communitiy .
[native] not really : central banks have a mandate to ensure price stability .
[non-native] on the other hand , if we just go to the tour guide shop tell where they want to go , the touris would kindly introduce us a perfect plan .
[non-native] the new inventions and new facilities in a car like air condition , music system cars and big cars like limozine which are like a home in itself , are becoming more and more comfortable and easy going .
[non-native] unfortunately i received the package yestarday and i found that the knife was just simple as all other knifes that i currently have in my house !
[non-native] as a result , i could be a specialist in the geography and at the same time i had a major geography in the university .
[non-native] even though young ages looks like the best times for enjoying life , very few young people are aware of that .
[native] black metal bands are generally anti-religious , nothing new .
[non-native] so we can add some hundred of millions to the current number of cars . ..
[native] [ 11 ] after this story caught the national attention in south korea , many other cases of ethnic discrimination were reported .
[non-native] therefore , i strongly disagree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .innovation in business life
[native] well , i think the majority of iraq actually * did * support the intervention at first .
[native] > of course this fantasy is a thing of the past - the truth is that we europeans are dying out , and without immigrants we will be in very big trouble in a few decades .
[native] turkish is an ural altaic language that uses an entirely different writing system to greek .
[non-native] as far as i am concerned , traveling without a tour guild can provide me with more pleasure .
[non-native] on the other hand , travelling with a group led by a tour guide will be more organized .
[native] just have a public awareness campaign to report anyone that has used a service but seemed sketchy ( no personnummer or whatever ) .
[native] > but if the neo-nazi brigade was not there the neo-nazis would not be there either , or am i reading it wrong ?
[native] they shoot , you shoot back and then they go away ?
[native] ] ( http://i.imgur.com/megtmug.png ) the pinwheel effect on the red saltire actually comes by combining it with the white scottish one and would n't be there if scotland were removed .
[native] now imagine what a korean unification would look like .
[non-native] so in my opinion oli agree the most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
[native] there is too much diversity in european politics to follow a common policy , likewise for leftists like myself it would condemn us to permanent right wing rule due to the disportionate roles played by the likes of germany and the uk .
[native] it 's at two points for me at the moment .
[native] so they would have had to go through a long process of getting every member state to implement a charge on the power consuming vacuum cleaners .
[native] so , on average , people in the uk dress a little better ?
[non-native] if we just follow ours ' opinions , we can just stay in the same place , without process .
[non-native] there are other factors that young people can not control for themselves .
[non-native] cars have given many benefits to the humanity , by allowing people to travel to places they would want to go in a very short time , or carrying heavy loads that can not be carried by humans .
[native] this is the real reason black market economies are now being included , there are many eu countries in dire financial situations , and they want their economies to look bigger to avoid these penalties .
[non-native] the resource is good to future for me .i agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts , because ideas and concepts are the roots of the facts , it is the ideas that make the facts to exist and undestanding ideas will help the students to be productive .
[native] yes they are killing thousands by shelling cities full of people .
[non-native] i think that the most important characteristic of a successful person is the want to better oneself , and this is made by the want to learn new things .
[native] but to be honest , i 've tuned israel out .
[native] for us , europe is that place with higher wages .
[native] > because then there 's no one country that gets a clear advantage politically ( except ireland , but they 're small enough to not spark concerns ) .
[native] lenin himself was in favour of `` national liberation '' , as we would call it .
[non-native] that is , tell the consumers that what they see is what they will get .
[non-native] besides , something that i want to visit or do may not be part of the tour .
[non-native] these thing made my very busy and not to even allow me to wartch my favorite tv show !
[non-native] they will be metting and discuss the solutions for the problems in colony .
[native] took me nine attempts before i got all 24 .
[non-native] when in the case of another student who is concentrating in different kinds of subjects , in this hypothetical case the student definitely gets familiar in many topics that he had read .
[native] the more realistic one is that putin is no dummy .
[native] most likely they went over for a fight , saw some gunfire , shat themselves , and went home with even less of a clue who they are .
[native] i would love to see the us take the money we would otherwise put into bombs and put it into subsidizing european natural gas exports so europe can sanction russian gas without the price shooting through the roof .
[native] i am in favour of eu migration as it provides lots of people of working age and that benefits the uk , i do n't think you should misrepresent the facts though .
[non-native] a person who can not maintain a balance between his personal and professional life can not enjoy life .
[non-native] if this happens often , the children can not devellop a close relationship to their communities .
[non-native] taking the examle of the stock market where the risk factor is extremely high since you know you could easily loose money if the market collapses , and then you look at the returns generated through the market which happen to be far more than what you would have earned putting your money in a banks fixed deposit .
[native] in some other parts of the eurozone , unit labour costs remain massively high compared to germany ( italy in particular ) and this harms their exports .
[native] by the way , you may appreciate / r/european more than / r/europe .
[native] yet out of the five more intelligent countries you mention , two think being in the eu is a bad idea , four have avoided joining the euro , and one has just placed immigration limits on european migration ( in defiance of treaty agreements ) .
[non-native] the advertisements are showed by many ways , from the most common and popular television , till the most sofisticate internet and movil phone .
[non-native] being a successful salesman did not just teach him how to sell shoes but how economy in general works .
[native] you can change to a system of `` lowest bidder wins and is responsible for cost overruns '' .
[non-native] this experience clearly shows that getting broad knowledge is more useful in business .
[non-native] more important than finding time to gather knowledge , is to make sure you do n't loose the one you once had .
[non-native] one possibilty is to show the customer a product which differs from the real one .
[native] it shows lack of rationality and critical thinking , and usually comes part and parcel with a whole lot of other negative modes of thinking such as homophobia or sexism .
[native] two of the eggs get implanted into the placenta , resulting in twins .
[native] increasing scientific research to 1.5 % of gdp 11 .
[native] they will likely stay away from direct confrontation with the ukrainians , and will likely shell the ukrainians from a distance .
[non-native] secondly most of the advertisements contains graphics and high resolution videos and images .
[native] do you know how long it would take to construct pipelines to these nations once those deals had been ratified , or the vastly increased cost and risk given the far less traversible terrain of central asia and the himalayas ?
[non-native] successful people are knows as persons who are couragious , fighting , and humble .
[native] eu structural funds will eventually help make it a reality , maybe 5 to 10 years from now ?
[native] but hopefully , this will at least dissuade some of those posters that think that the eu is trying to lower consumer standards because negotiators work for big business , or whatever other bizarre conspiracy theories they come up with .
[native] ----------- the appeal to authority relies on an argument of the form : a is an authority on a particular topic a says something about that topic a is probably correct ----------- i 'm not claiming that i 'm correct on a topic .
[non-native] i would rather gamble my life to become the best not just middle .
[native] [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2hs0te/some_of_you_asked_so_heres_wind_power_per_capita/ckvk8u3?context=2 ) thread of comments seems to indicate i was correct , but i know / u/barsoap as one of the more intelligent posters in / r/europe so i 'll eagerly await his reply to / u/cxmetal !
[native] but when you disagree about several major issues of how the eu already is , and when your desires are pretty much the opposite of the eu 's direction for the last 10 years , it 's really time to consider whether continued membership is best for everyone .
[native] just like labour did when they claimed the lisbon treaty was nothing like the eu constitution and was just a `` tidying up exercise '' .
[non-native] third , in my actual experince i found many young people trying to convince the old people with them ideas and let them help to do the things they want to improve them countries .
[native] it might be relevant , it might not , but everybody should be aware of potential biases , such as they are .
[native] australia accepted a number of refugees from czechoslovakia ( and greece ! )
[native] ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/za0lbrrxgmw/0.jpg ) they 'll be guaranteed to claim rosetta/philae .
[native] the russians are n't though , making 120 million suffer is never going to be black and white .
[non-native] the point is that i believe that advertisement can be both very profitable and dangerous for a producer .
[native] > the uk has no more of a demos than europe - but if you need it the commitment to freedom , liberty and human rights are as necessary a mandate as you 'll find .
[non-native] to elaborate this point , consider the example of a group of partying teenagers .
[non-native] of course i have to admit that without people with a very specific knowledge in one field we would n't have progress in sciences or new discoveries due to their patience and application in their subject .
[native] putin will go but you can bet he will never go quietly .
[native] i actually really like the bulgarian and romanian anthems .
[non-native] furthermore i think that you usually need to get some facts first before you can start to get some ideas or concepts .
[non-native] thirty years ago , it seems unbelievable to imagine having a phone call outside .
[non-native] so i think that there will be more cars in twenty years than they are today .this is a very difficult question to answer because i 've seen some old people enjoying their life everyday and some young people worry about their future and its challenges .
[non-native] hence i strongly agree to the people who are trying to invent new things , we should encourage them rather than dissapointing them in their inventory .what is the best way to learn ?
[non-native] moreover , the aim of the university is to prepare the students to have a job in their future life , in which they will probably need capacities of understanding and reacting in front of a situation more than pure memory .
[non-native] according to me the mean of successful people is that doing its best without so much ambitious .
[non-native] the richest people may then be the only ones who will earn enough money to buy what is the main need to make a car work .
[non-native] it 's a huge work on yourself and who you ( think you ) are .
[native] the new system includes things like drugs and prostitution .
[native] no not all wars are completely taken over , but no american solider has protected someone right to criticize their government pretty much ever , which was my point .
[non-native] the `` build '' component of the company proved to be the biggest revenue grosser at the company .
[non-native] there is no doubt coke cola is one the most dominate player in bavage market .
[non-native] however , i do believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars than now .
[non-native] which , then takes us to the question of which is better , a generalistic or specific .
[native] this just made it happen sooner since it allowed china to leverage deals very much in it 's favor & distracted russia by forcing it to put all it 's focus on the west .
[non-native] in almost all advertisements we can see only the good sides of the product .
[non-native] whoever have no tensions in life they enjoy the most .
[native] ca n't believe i got downvoted for taking the piss out of my own country for its obsession with eurovision
[native] i 've just applied for a partner visa to marry my australian so and jesus christ , even as a white person the amount of casual racism i receive over there and that my so receives for marrying me is mind blowing .
[non-native] for example , earth is existing on solar system , it is fact .
[non-native] the difference with older people lies in the fact that they are asked to do almost everything they do as older people choose a job , a wife , a place to live and all the others things .
[native] here 's a better solution : italy , france , spain , portugal , malta , san marino , monaco and wallonia all reunite and form a new roman republic .
[non-native] this has brought a sea of change among the mindest of the whole society , and is now even entering the coporate boardrooms .
[native] it was all settled over a four hour meeting .
[non-native] for nowadays the young people do n't give enough time to helping their communities .
[non-native] speaking of , it 's abundance is dropping dangerously , and of course the price is equally expanding .
[non-native] they contrinued to take enormous monetary and other risks to develop all their subsequent products , especially ms word , even when other word processing products like word perfect were more popular at the time .
[native] because those numbers are backed by very reliable nongovernment polling .
[native] i 've since lived in four different countries , and i 've found that my ` roots ' are unimportant , what 's important are the people i gather around me ( friends , family , colleagues ) at each place that i live .
[non-native] i ca n't now imagine a world without cars .
[non-native] in contrast with understandind the ideas , learning facts is a specific activity , where you memorize selected aspects of your interest .
[native] the undying loyalty to ukip over there is reminiscent of the nazis or the soviets .
[non-native] moreover specialization develops the interest in the subject , and he will feel satisfied with his job .
[native] it 's great news and it 's because the irish people managed to get through quite a terrible time without turning to anarchy and they rightly deserve a pat on the back .
[native] > although he 's mostly bet the correct way . .
[non-native] to sum it up , i think it would be very unfair on anyone 's part to say that youngsters do not help in community work .
[native] catholics in england and wales are politically and culturally almost interchangeable from non-catholics and in this context it is very hard for catholics to even summon up the energy to be annoyed by the lewes goings on .
[native] as for pre-christian norse , they did n't write much about what they believed in , so a lot has to be deduced from archaeology .
[non-native] in my society , there are much young people who success their job , dream , project , and so on .
[native] china only cares about money , and is essentially ideology-less except `` china rich china stronk ''
[non-native] they would like to use different color and different famous person .
[native] the country of japan to this day does plenty to deny the atrocities of wwii .
[native] for god 's sake man , this is why confidence in our political system has collapsed .
[non-native] additionally to this argument , older ones probably do not enjoy life less than young , they only have other interests that are perhaps less observable .
[non-native] in conclusion , it is more important to understand ideas instead of facts to be more successful in this education system , and also to get teachers admire .
[non-native] i had really no clue , because i just knew some simple facts .
[non-native] the gift of life was given to us and we can enjoy it the way we want as long as we do not affect other people 's beliefs and lives .i would rather agree with that statement .
[non-native] he should conecentrate more on other subjects as he find them tough .
[native] in fact all the anglo countries are diverse in regards to ethnicity .
[non-native] when we went to a restaurant , the menu was written in hongle , not even in english .
[non-native] to conclude , i would say that the world today belongs majorly to a specialist and hence the importance of specialising and in fact super specialising in a subject .
[non-native] some people would change the country to be more successful in their life .
[non-native] also , it took more than a hundred years to develope and when it will go back , it can not go faster , in my opinion .
[native] which they just may skip doing cause its just a day trip away .
[non-native] secondly i would like to take the example of the father of my nation mahatma ghandhi who was greatly successful because of his new ways to fight the british rule .
[native] because when germany tells greece to adapt austerity measures , what they 're politely saying is `` you 're so fucking corrupt i hope everyone with their hand in the cookie jar starves '' .
[non-native] i disagree to this statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
[non-native] most young people say `` no i do n't wa n't to go to the army ( bundeswehr ) '' and instead spend nine `` social month '' ( zivildienst ) in for example hospitals or `` altenheime '' a place where old people can go and where they live until the end of there lives .
[non-native] it is only because einstein conducted 1000 experiments we get bulb .
[non-native] it is unevitable concequence if he goes to a university .
[native] he can not seem to grasp the concept of freedom of expression , freedom of press , democracy and lgbti rights , and considering that those things were non-existent in the soviet union , he does n't want that to change .
[native] it is going by current government bond prices which have been doing very well in ireland and stagnating in the uk .
[non-native] they want also to to come with new project wich can make them more successful .
[non-native] when i reach home , it 's almost 7:00 pm .
[non-native] it has greatly improved transportation and brought tremendous convenience to our lives .
[non-native] he will get good fameas far as i am concered , a people , need not to say , should specialize in certain subjects for the sake of having living metold , however , i still take it for granted that people should have broad knowledge of many aspects .
[non-native] this misrepresentation will continue as long as it goes until someone come and show the real faces of these companies and advertisement agencies to all world , but until that time i wonder ` what is next'i strongly agree with the fact that successful people are avid risktakers .
[non-native] the real knoledge is based on two fondamental points :
[non-native] he was a very bright student , but he used to focus on many subjects .
[non-native] in a conclusion , taking the points i have mentioned above into consideration , it would be appropriate to say that specializing in one specific subject creating more job oppornuties and as a result of this effect contury 's economical situation will develop .
[native] the elites are so disassociated from the people , all they care about is tricking people into voting for them .
[non-native] but , i do n't think so , because to my mind it 's only a way to not be threaten by our futur .
[non-native] a teacher should also have knowledge about didactics , psychology and pedagogics , because he must be able to teach , to communicate and to handle students in a appropriate way .
[non-native] a reacent survey shows a fact that over 60 percent people would like to give up cars to chose another transpotation if it can reduce the pollution of the city .
[native] i think the propaganda is still very effective even today .
[native] he was a former gangster , and has a very very shady past .
[non-native] any citizen of a county needs to know atleast some history about his country .
[native] and the assumption that i must have become an expert in vodka varieties and playing tetris .
[non-native] i not saying that learning facts are not important in students careers infact once they will understand the ideas then they will start to apply those concepts but since the beginning of student career they really need to assimilate more ideas that they can even support , as much as possible i mean .
[native] if the scots of the american south could be inspired by the homeland they 're so damned proud of to take steps towards building an education , healthcare , and criminal justice system that the people in their homeland want to build , it will permanently shift the ground in american politics .
[non-native] many of my friends try to learn something that is given in classroom and do not give any importance to search facts about that subject .
[non-native] i think that every person can enjoy life to the fullest , whether young or old , by doing the things he enjoys doing the most .
[native] the cap is n't actually that bad , it 's at around the average level of protection by oecd standards .
[native] since the crisis , the ratio of public debt to gross domestic product has jumped by 46 percentage points in the uk and 40 points in the us , against 26 points in the eurozone .
[non-native] in addition , the member in the group will help each other and share their feelings about the scenery with others , which will make the tour more interesting and funny .
[native] you 're just a crazily obsessed yank that 's been drinking too much koolaid .
[native] i 'm an atheist myself and i really hate religion , but at the same time i recognise that in the case of islam , women are often victims of religious subjugation ... why victimise her * even more * by forcing her to be undignified and embarrassed in front of an audience ?
[non-native] therefore , the statement is completely true .education system based on unchangable knowledge , leads students to learn this ideas ; and this undesirable situation will continue for a long time and it seems to pass over next centuries .
[native] what kind of quality threshold does there have to be for the forced printing ?
[non-native] but , when you are older , you also know that only one life was given to you , but your pholosophy , your perspective is different because you think since there is only one life to live , you have to appreciate it , take care of it and enjoy it loving and respecting yourself : risks are not the same in each stage of life .
[non-native] thus , it should deserve the society 's appreciation .
[non-native] after signing the contract , they found the appropriate piece of software called dos , and developed it sufficiently to meet all the contract requrements of ibm .
[native] it says so in the textbook right next to the part about jesus killing dinosaurs 2,000 years ago with his remington rifle .
[native] do you know how long it would take to ratify deals with india and china , much farther away from the russian body workforce in the west , and the likely poorer nature of those deals for russia given both state 's history of dealing and russia 's own self-imposed pariah status ?
[native] op up there is a moron but unless you did n't see the people in general before you obviously noticed .
[native] je le suis , et j' ai jamais mentionnÃ© la langue que je garderais ... ;) * i am , and i never mentioned the language i would keep ... * ;)
[non-native] there are many people who are succeded without the risk .
[native] yikes , steve jobs was n't perfect by any means but you have to admire his persistence and energy to build a company with more cash than the gdp of denmark .
[non-native] aimless is the biggest enemy in front of a man .
[native] > just find another supplier of fuels ` just ' ?
[non-native] so , from a moral and ecological point of view , we have no other choice but to reduce cars .
[non-native] all the leading buisness companies of the world take a major risk when they invests into a new project .
[native] i just meant separationists who do n't really have a very thorough plan laid out for independence around the world .
[non-native] if he has to travel urgently without wasting time he has to prefer a car of a flight .
[native] putting them in jail is not racist , but focusing on one specific group of people to stop is racist .
[non-native] so , at the end of the road if he was ambesiuos he can do it .
[non-native] second , without a special focus on special subject , one can hardly successed .
[non-native] this is probably limited to korean social situation but this makes students focus on just their study not on helping the community or else .
[native] the 1 billion + muslims are all apparently worthless parasites who ca n't be trusted not to do jihad patrols ( whatever the fucks that is , i presume you meant sharia but know too little about islam to differentiate ) or mass terrorist attacks ... have you ever even met a muslim ?
[native] the ` trz ' is a little tricky , so something like ` tch-na-del ' .
[non-native] right now , many people try new things , and some people will be fail , or some people will be great success .
[native] because doctors are experts on matters of international trade and negotiation .
[non-native] i dont think specialization in one specific subject is enough to enjoy this growth .
[non-native] for example when the famous cook uses the knife in tv advertisements this knife will seem more useful .
[non-native] this eliminates the pressure to meet people for the purpose of socializing during vacation .
[native] i simply do not know how to get through to them .
[non-native] in summary , i think that it is good thing for them to have the knowledge about various subjects .
[native] there are at least three places in romania that have their name written on a hilltop in hollywood-style white letters like that , brasov , rasnov and deva .
[native] > i have the strange feeling lately that we share more with the british than the germans .
[non-native] if you are not one of these you have to find a way to be noticed by the customer .
[non-native] but when society loses the unity of people , people would fight each other because they only think of their convenience .
[non-native] on tv 's , on magazines , on roads .
[non-native] from now on , i do studies online or read some consumer reviews before i purchase .
[non-native] however the introducton of new products in other way may result in disasters .
[non-native] they are often from that particular country and they know how to speak the local language and they understand how things work , so that you would feel more comfortable and would trust them as being your leader .
[non-native] that 's why as a young person i have been trying to enjoy until i lose my abilities and power .
[non-native] although , there many reasons can prove many view , i just want to explore some of them below .
[native] well hopefully the people 's party is obliterated at the next election .
[native] i 'm for immigration but almost everyone has a point where they start to think maybe it should slow down a bit .
[native] neither paris or frankfurt are really setting themselves up to be global financial centres in the way that london is at the moment .
[native] he is right though , that person posts all the time on r/russia and i can assure you they are not a sympathetic source of information .
[non-native] besides , young people have less pressure from the society .
[non-native] if what the people try to do is succeed , then he/she can be a hero and others may respect them .
[native] honestly i feel canadian is waiting for the fta with the eu to be complete to announce major contracts for eurofighters .
[native] i 'll try to look up exact numbers and edit this post .
[non-native] this only represents a change along the car product and not just on the industry as a whole .
[native] > is 5 or 10 % more expensive locally but keeps the money circulating in the local economy had better macro economic benefits than buying the same item from a multinational who repatriates all their profits .
[native] i can get paid four times as much in real terms in places like hong kong , the us and canada , whereas the cost of living is cheaper in 2 out of 3 of those places and only twice as much in the other .
[non-native] one can never grow and develope if they keep on preforming what they already know how to do well , inorder for somone to grow and develope they must try new things , take chances , and make mistakes .
[non-native] and usually the things which looks good outside it cost more expenciner then the things which looks ugly , but the expencive one may not really useful then the cheaper one .
[native] you understand there are horribly toxic chemicals even in consumer grade chocolate , but it 's at such levels that it 's not harmful ?
[non-native] they are not just preparing for the test at the moment .
[native] there was an incident about a year or two ago where a job advert was placed on some australian website telling irish not to apply , it turned out that the person who placed the advert was irish himself .
[non-native] people should learn valuable lessons from new experiences and feel sense of achievement .there are a lot of people live in the world .
[native] mate , your posts are just becoming embarrassing at this stage .
[native] another great article touching on this very thing : [ ** russia 's in the driver 's seat , but china 's buying the car ** ] ( http://www.rferl.org/content/qishloq-ovozi-russia-china-hegemony/25474182.html )
[native] if we leave we can accept as many eu migrants as we want .
[non-native] so , people must rely on each other and must be active .
[native] by discriminating against those that do n't have fair skin ?
[native] curious that you 'd neglect to mention this ( portraying the inclusion of isds provisions as one-sided ) when earlier you were talking about checking for biases .
[native] what is my ` ilk ' exactly , and how am i naive ?
[non-native] because i thought i can learn more about the bussiness and i belive i can understand it more and can learn different method from different teacher .
[non-native] therefore , most adveritisements over tell cosumers their produces adventages .
[non-native] yet , an old widow in a country like mine , for example , might not be able to get married because of she will be afried of what the society might say about her getting married at that age .
[native] i 'm pretty sure the tiny group of individuals the danish cops are concerned with did n't manage to butcher and rape thousands of people .
[native] the hope was to keep as much of germany as possible out of the hands of the soviets ( who were raping , burning and pillaging their way to berlin at the time ) .
[native] the only options it would have would be accept economic policies that nobody really voted for .
[non-native] for those reasons i discourage everyone to have broad knowledge .i agree whit the answer .
[non-native] whenever i encounter many new interesting places in other countries , i would like to change my schedule .
[native] i was quite a fan of the polish movie ` persona non grata ' .
[non-native] most of the people understand they ways liek when you work you gust need to know the way of the work for a person who works as at a company and he 's a programmer he just need to do the programmes got they company like that you gust understand the way you should do it .
[native] means i 'd only need to buy one sim instead of 10
[native] a bunch of non-muslims going to fight for isis is strange .
[non-native] they are often not able to keep up with all new streams and developments in society .
[non-native] compare with young 's energy , the older would not have any advantages .
[native] overall , it seems somewhat naive to think that corruption can be prevented/solved by declaring independence from the rest of spain , especially considering that the eu itself released [ a study ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/docgener/work/2012_02_governance.pdf ) that pointed out catalonia as one of the most corrupt regions in the eu .
[non-native] for instance , a simple product like '' soap '' , has to fulfill its purpose .
[non-native] many specific knowledge is what makes you an expert in some area .
[non-native] however , these does n't mean the older people have nothing to do to enjoy their everyday life .
[non-native] these companies have great competition between themselves and they are ready to do everything even these things are unethical .
[non-native] it is controversial whether the number of cars will decreases in future .
[native] the provinces were created at 1833 and the autonomous regions between 1978 and 1983 .
[non-native] so we should teach them to our children before they gain ability to understand ideas and concepts .
[non-native] on the other hand i do n't mean older people can not find anything to enjoy .
[native] basically , they ca n't have their cake and eat it .
[non-native] the things you want to do will change gradually you get older .
[non-native] i can have a mountain of problem for this situation , because every day i was far of my city , and i have rage for this , because every day i was at home for little hours .
[native] the us has n't been in the annexation business since more than a century ago .
[non-native] this has always been the case with most of the successful men in history .you can find advertisements everywhere : in newspapers , in the cinema , at bus stations and even on the toilet paper .
[non-native] every historical place or any amusement park we went , we traveled with a big tour bus .
[native] home : windows 8.1 on desktop xubuntu on virtualbox for development os x on laptop xubuntu on laptop ( via virtualbox ) work : mostly windows 7 , though ubuntu sometimes depending on what i need to do .
[non-native] though many young people may also think the free travel better , i prefer to travel freely if possible since i do not have to care about a tour members regarding a meal , appointment time or place to go and i can go everywhere i would like to go .
[native] if we left we 'd be the # 1 export market for the eu .
[non-native] it makes students easy to forget the way how they calculate them as long as they do not try to keep them in mind often .
[non-native] due to the fact that i do n't need to think about the schedule of tour guide .
[native] https://twitter.com/boards/status/525223148451815424 someone needs to get rid of the intern/social media guy who 's running their twitter account .
[native] for example it teamed up with right wing euroskeptics as opposed to joining gue/ngl , which is essentially the big tent for the radical left .
[native] but i guess you would need to have some sort of grasp on the geopolitics involved here .
[native] it 's too important and too central to what the eu is becoming ; it 's biggest military spender , an economic juggernaut , a center of education , and the biggest counterweight to german unilateral influence while france remains politically castrated .
[native] so some scots want to be `` independent '' from a democratic union which has consent ( uk ) but want to maintain membership of the eu which has neither democracy nor consent ( and which hates nationalism , including the scottish variety ) .
[non-native] on the contrary , the person not to try to new things and take risks can not prospect and see different field and also he or she may be embarassed or surprised these circumstances because of no experience .
[native] yes , minister is the first one and i think it 's much better
[non-native] not to be partial , older people have their own ways of enjoying life which might be difficult for the youngerones to follow .
[native] make no mistake , these are legal proceedings , it 's not some piss up down at the pub , and they 're not entirely secret .
[native] i like the german model for healthcare and benefits , myself .
[native] people should have the ability to choose how they present themselves , regardless of whether it is a religious statement or not .
[native] ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lcd4dkm.jpg ) the blue in the current flag does n't match that used in the scottish flag after all .
[native] see above , this is a limitation of living so far away : there are some things we do n't hear about .
[native] no , we want a strong russia to trade with , however there is n't really much of an alternative .
[non-native] they can insist on security , fun , sportivity , but it 's always to make people feel attached to a way of thinking and behaving .
[native] the current economic condition makes life challenging , but things could be much worse.the commission also has a history of investigating and fining companies that abuse their monopolistic position .
[non-native] and we have to admit that part of the problem is that we believe in it , the people in the marketing market is pretty smart they make us feel we need something when we actually do n't , just because we saw our favorite pair of jeans on a famous person we need them , they made us feel that necessity just because we like that actor ( actress ) , he/she look good in them but that doens't mean that you 'll look the same with them on .
[non-native] so , sooner or later , everybody has to change his habits .
[native] which does n't necessarily make him expert on geopolitics .
[non-native] last but not least , i am firmly convinced that the aim of advertisements is not only to make products seem much better than they really are , it is also to brainwash people in order to make them interested only by material things .
[native] sorry but finland has no public support support even though the neo-liberal 's in power think they can push it on people
[native] many toll roads in the us ( and i assume other countries as well ) let you pay the toll without slowing down , by getting an rfid device to stick to your windshield .
[native] crime 's about a lot of things , yes , and culture is one of them
[native] i 'm using it to show that them paying in during the early years is n't evidence they 're a net benefit long term .
[non-native] and they are less defined by their jobs , a family , a duty or handicaped by their physical abilities .now-day the market is becoming more and more competitive compared to the past years .
[native] moderately smoking pure tobacco has very few harmful effects .
[non-native] working in different subject give us a chance to find the subject which we really like .
[native] > how dare we despise their ~ ~ occupation ~ ~ vacation !
[native] this seems like rewarding bad behavior rather than sound economic policy .
[non-native] as a graduate from the international relations department , i can give many sub-titles such as europe , middle east , far east , territorial waters , weapons of mass destruction , etc . ..
[native] those are anecdotal , there has to be a study on the matter .
[non-native] it is often believed that the purpose of advertisements is only to make people aware of the existence of the product .
[native] except they would n't be attacking italy , they 'd be defending themselves from italian ships violating their territorial waters .
[native] down here it seems to be the lower middle class who love ukip .
[non-native] stating this , i do not want to say that it is better to risk instead of having a secure return ; i just want to say that to have success you need to be a little risky and try new challenges that you have not already tried .
[native] none of this is to say that i in any way support russia ( because i do n't at all ) , but rather that i do n't support what armenia is doing ( even if there was already an unfortunate situation in the area ) .
[native] because whilst that sucks , and i 'm sorry it happened , is that really an excuse to be against anyone that 's basically black ?
[native] what 's the best place to put a bomb ?
[non-native] what does it help someone if i know the facts of the processe of the photosynthesis for three days , but never realised what importance the photosynthesis has for the humanbeeing ?
[native] but you have to analyze the material , social and political conditions in context to what happened .
[native] ( that was supposed to be a cheeky joke )
[native] also , i think you grossly over-estimate the control the us has over the decision-making of a foreign military .
[native] financial sectors have deleveraged in the us and uk , however ; so , too , have households in the us and , to a lesser degree , the uk .
[native] pull factors are things like better pay , better conditions , etc , which ` pull ' employees to a different job , and they give the example of eu steel workers instead moving to the automotive sector .
[native] they 're the one 's that have been pushing for it from the start and want it more than the us does .
[native] the increase in posts here about russian planes flying the same way they have for years now is simply sabre rattling from the scared and the war hawks .
[non-native] many communities need helping hands to cover their problems .
[native] i do n't like the whole ` conspiratorial ' `` it 's just for the us corporations '' talk , when that 's clearly and evidently not the case .
[native] now i 'm called a chickenshit coward & downvoted to oblivion on this subreddit because i do n't want to risk a thermonuclear war by directly confronting russia in a conventional war over a non-nato & non-eu country .
[native] and where did i say that you were racist because of ` not wanting swedes to be a minority ' ?
[native] everyone always forgets ( or willingly ignores ) the fact that even economic migrants also age , just as the native population does .
[native] horrible , but i do n't know if that justifies ethnic cleansing .
[non-native] a young person may do lots of things in a single day than an older one .
[non-native] having a little bit of knowledge in many topis is not so effecient in todays society as if people are specialist on specific topics .
[non-native] everyone start his life as a child , then he gradually start the young people life .
[non-native] it 's very much important for him to understand what is dealt about before forming an opinion on the topic .
[native] i 've worked extensively overseas - just make sure you have the right skills / languages and you can work anywhere .
[native] i do n't think we 've ever had either end-member of the spectrum from total non-intervention to total intervention .
[non-native] also , this might give you the chance to create newer things .
[non-native] after working , most people tend to spend their time watching television and take a nap .
[native] the eu , at 25 % is turkey 's second favorite .
[non-native] there can be cases where people in young age are incapacitated in various aspects as well .
[non-native] i do n't believe most advertisements make products better .
[native] they 're fucking stupid , gullible idiots who are getting involved in things they absolutely should n't .
[non-native] i disagree with it because it is a very general statment and it is a typical stereotype and categorizing of young people .
[native] the solution is to require anyone that wishes to submit dmca requests has to have a dmca license number and be registered with the country that the company resides in for the lawful take down .
[non-native] its very important for them to understant the main ideas f any topic .
[non-native] if you are a chemist , and you are constantly trying to change your ways of making , or synthesizing , chemical compunds , you might come out with less expensive methods .
[native] but you are not representative of the whole uk population .
[native] number with * i * in it is not [ real number ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/real_number ) .
[native] and besides which , i think we 've managed very well to avoid making famous copies of very famous cities .
[non-native] they took a contract to develop an operating system for ibm even when they had no product in hand .
[native] it 's nowhere near as big as london , but it 's still a big city .
[native] maybe he already started doing this guys suggestion : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2kxkvu/i_have_nowhere_to_go_for_holidays_in_norther/clpmusj
[native] when i go home from uni i get the joy of finding a copy of it on the coffee table each morning .
[non-native] most of the working youngsters want to earn more and and enjoy their free time .
[non-native] to conlude , i think that everybody should have the choice to specialize in one specific subject , the one they like the most , but they would also have to have broad knowledge of many subjects .i do agree with the statement saying that successful people are the one who take risks with innovative things instead of what they knew already .
[native] no , it was compromise , trading economic independence for the benefits of free trade .
[non-native] on the other hand some people claim that this is not true for all the cases , there can maybe some loyal companies which wants to be virtuous towards their customers , but their numbers are really quite limited .
[non-native] whereas the excitement at the beginning of trips causes most people to subordinate their own preferences to the group 's interest , this is likely to change over the course of a vacation .
[non-native] the advertisement ought to be more strictly to the reality to show to the watchers the real characteristics of the each product .
[native] even if you are right , that is still racism .
[native] pakistan on the other hand , has provided a major immigrant group for a few decades , but their acceptance is far less than the white anglosphere .
[native] i wished they did , because i 'd like to know myself .
[native] considering the things they 've said about us we 'll happily see them go .
[non-native] even the more successful people there is , the more they have to challenge to get new one .
[non-native] he was one of the first people in the world to do research on computers and who developed the internet .
[native] it would definetly have to go parliamentary , for the federal government at least , though local governments for provinces/counties/states / territorys/whatever the hell we end up using could choose what system they want for themselves .
[native] switzerland has an offical policy of neutrality , so they wo n't be sending any `` russian kids back in bodybags '' , even if putin decides to invade all of western europe except switzerland .
[native] unfortunately , the growth of nominal gdp in the eurozone is also dismal : inflation is ultra-low and real gdp is growing weakly , under the blows of fiscal retrenchment and structurally inadequate private demand .
[non-native] there is always they way that people use there ways of knowing the thing for me it 's better to understand what you should do and not to learn the fact , let 's say i have a physics class i have understand the rules and i have to know how to use them but most important is that you use the way that is most easyer for you .i agree that most advertisements make produces seem much better than they really are beceause most people accept them and companies that show their produces better than produces really are be benefited by this kinds od advertisements .

[native] the idea that something as complex as political union in europe , with a vast range of negative and positive issues is equivalent to 2 + 2 = 4 just shows how close-minded your beliefs are .

[native] we can do this so soon because we can now borrow for cheaper than the uk ( apparently we are a safer bet to loan to so get better interest rates , it 's been on the news here all day ) .
[non-native] in conclution depending the travel that you do you may need differents things like a toor guide but in my case without import if a ravel in group or alone i do not like to travel with a tour guide .some people choose to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , while others prefer to be specialized in one specific subject .

[non-native] it does not matter whether science advances so far as to transport a person from one point to other through virtual domain but science would have certainly progressed enough to discourage people from using cars by providing them with ample of other transportation facilities which would finally lead to a reduction in number of cars in use twenty years later then there are today .nowadays , people argue that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
[non-native] but i 'm pretty sure about the number of a car for each person who has the car would never get discrease but not everybody would drive their car everyday .

[non-native] people do not success just by waiting on oportunities to come to them .
[non-native] but if you have little knowledge of many subjects , then you cant be a testimony and people will not trust you for any information becuse you do not specialise in any subjects and moreover when you are a testimony because you have specialised in one subject , you get a broader aspect of getting a good job .
[native] so with this mind set change you have to think that russia is going to take eastern ukraine and then move on to kiev !
[native] meanwhile , we have to deal with [ americans that accidentally bring their handguns into canada ] ( http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/americans-with-guns-at-border-use-cultural-difference-defence-1.1235693 ) .
[non-native] however the advertisment will not mention intentionally the drawbacks of the product .
[native] * that * is what losing a major war looks like to israelis .
[non-native] these people are the bases of many domains of our society because they are able to give very precise specifics .
[non-native] if i can not do somthing on every part , they can not participate their streams .
[non-native] however , people who have their own cars should pay much more taxes , according to the new policy .
[native] canada has been thinking of buying a mistral ship for sometime , maybe now will be that time .

[non-native] in addition , makking the same thing your alredy know maks your life roteenly and boring and you will get the same thing you always get .
[native] it was n't until patreaus came in and helped stitch those wounds back together with a huge troop surge & ability to convince the sunni tribal leaders to throw out al-qaeda & begin working with the iraqi government * ( bags of money & the hugely increased american presence to help gurantee security probably being of no little help i imagine ) * .
[non-native] among doctors , a general practictioner has knowledge of human body but are not specialized in purticular area like cardiology , neurology etc .
[native] most importantly , the number of embryos put into the surrogate should not exceed the number of kids the intended parents can raise , and if the parents should only be alloweed to make surrogacy contracts if they can raised and love a disabled child ( because there is a chance that the child can be born disabled ) .

[native] i 've seen a good many germans actually criticize poland for doing to germany what germany is actively doing to the rest of the eurozone .
[non-native] for example , my friend dose n't know the neightboor because they do n't meet each other and there are n't event in their community .
[non-native] however , when this product sell on the market , it becomes pretty expensive because of the expense of advertisements .
[native] yeah we did in the 70 's however for over 100 years canada has been reliant on the us , in fact we are their largest trading partner .
[non-native] it is mainly based on providing the employees home near their respective offices .

[non-native] in the end , i will conclude the issue by emphasizing that not only do we consistantly study different subjects but also we encourage others to do so .yes , i totally agree with this statement saying that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
[native] in the last months of the war , when hitler had fallen apart psychologically , himmler assumed numerous powers , often acting as de facto leader of germany .

[non-native] but in reality , there are always complicated paperwork to complete and a long process for the claim to be approved .
[non-native] in conclusion , having broad knowledge of many academic subjects has its own advantages and disadvantages , but since the advantages have more weight than the disadvantages , i think that having vroad knowledge of many academic subjects is the best choice to make .the concept is the base of life .
[non-native] on the other hand , trying to understand the cause of the movement is a much better idea .
[native] while there has been more hires in low-paid jobs , this is inevitable after a long recession .

[non-native] to begin with , pure learning ideas and concepts makes students confused about the subjects .

[native] and do you think us standards of living are much better for illegal immigrants from mexico ?
[native] so you think that european countries should be acting as colonial powers again , invading and controlling at whim over the wishes of the native population ?
[native] the settlements are ridiculous , but this is not a one-sided issue .
[native] i also love the theatre of politics and we certainly have a lot of that over on this side of the channel .
[non-native] i feel that the car industry will thus , shift its vision on cars from gasoline to highly productive , well-made electric cars .
[non-native] there are companies that only states the real facts of the products .
[native] imagine the damage if a buggy av software allowed somebody to exploit it to eavesdrop/steal documents .
[non-native] in long run , this method can save student 's time and money which relocated their goal .
[native] just fyi , you would say shade rather than shadows .
[native] the headlines from the press releases the parent poster linked to for example : > eu accounts signed off , but errors persist in all main spending areas , say eu auditors > eu must focus on getting better results from its spending
[native] i would also like to point out that almost all of canadians live near the border .
[native] > it is estimated that 0,3-0 ,5 of the entire eu workforce will lose their jobs if it passes .

[non-native] traveling alone is very good more often than not .
[non-native] the foundation engineering deals with foundation design , structural engineering deals with the super structure design and in this way each has its own entity , so a good engineer having a sound knowledge in any one area can excel in that field and would be able to deliver all the requirements needed in that specific field .
[native] when is the next real electoral test that podemos will face ?
[native] perhaps if you 're around longer/more active you 'll also have your own list of reliable and unreliable posters .
[non-native] in this repect , having broad knowledge of many academic is better than having knowledge in a certain subject .
[non-native] a lot of people thing about the best way to gain a lot of money and are very individual what i can understand too .
[non-native] so it is hard to agree or disagree with the statement because all of this depends on how the world will turn out to become in the next few years .
[native] that `` we will accept everyone '' proclamation is outdated .
[native] he even said that he would not `` persecute any that will be quiet and give an outward obedience to the law '' .
[native] emotions can make people do panic-stricken decisions when the pressure is on .
[native] he still thinks that we should respect russia 's sphere of influence rather than deny them it in order make russia feel better that it 's not a superpower anymore .
[native] i mean , i think it would be best served by having a cold buffet and a kitchen to make hot food for the staff , but i digress .
[non-native] they always think that it is them , who are the black sheep .
[non-native] because if you can study wide range of subject rather then to stick on to specific subject , your knowlege be wider and more accurate then others .
[non-native] you can go to the church and give your contibution for the poor people and if you want you can prey for them .
[native] after all , he was meant to be the perfect man .
[native] maybe that makes me more of a right-winger in europe , but i 'm fine with that .
[native] how you think anyone could have made that connection is beyond me .
[native] though i do think though that alot of the nato memberships were made at a time when russia was n't considered an enemy .
[non-native] the fact is less important than that .advertising is one of the best methods of corporations for selling their product and making their profit higher .
[native] we would form an alliance with the welsh as they also have a flag with a dragon and are our kindred spirits .
[non-native] first of all , if i have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , there are many common talking subjects with others .

[native] first they came for the kebabs , and i was not a kebab eater so i did n't speak up ...
[native] neither of the actual `` roman '' empires were gon na pop back to the top .
[native] i also think people are aware of the effect of both types of immigration on things like public services and housing availability , in which country origin does n't matter much .
[native] even the street i grew up on , there were social groups formed based on whether you lived in an even numbered house or an odd numbered house ( all the families in odd numbered houses were wifeswappers , i 'll hear no different ! )
[native] if not here 's the [ english version ] ( http://www.parl.gc.ca/about/senate/today/images/02-2-e.jpg ) ) head of state is the queen , represented in canada by the governor general , but they have no real power .
[non-native] skills these days ciould be viewed as baseball-card , a great way for kids to leant the art of trading , negotiating and war .
[native] the world revolves around asia now , and china is our greatest rival .
[native] we 've already watched what i 've described happen to all of south europe , why would it be any different with france in coming years ?
[non-native] every year a new discovery and a new invention is found .
[non-native] as a result , recent studies have shown examples of air-crafts , personal air-crafts for one or two people in it .
[non-native] like edison found out the light , like the shakespare created new kinds of article and dramas , and also like marx who created socalism .
[non-native] as a consequence , they do enjoy life by using their mental powers in order to succeed in different fields , or by writting and thinking about life in general .
[native] because of that lots of people ca n't afford nutritious food .
[native] but regardless , if i 'm going to become hungarian i 'd like to learn the language properly and not half-assed .
[native] but why should you pay for someone who does n't want to work ?
[native] though they say the scandi 's are all just as bad .
[native] the cathedral is enormous , and at night it looks like hogwarts .
[native] are n't they entitled some compensation when a government puts in a law that is unfairly prejudicial against them ?
[non-native] a small example for this is that one off my relatives son every day he should have to clean around his house and see the gardening .
[non-native] i think that it is possible to occur some problems because of differences of the thought between company and customer .
[native] you know there are n't many americans here , right ?
[native] hell , i even spoke in support of this eu wide operation the guy refers to , so i do n't see why you 'd think i 'm ok with it .
[non-native] like or not , cars are nowadays our principal mean of transport , even people do not use them in an efficient way .
[native] i hope you have a wonderful day in the sunshine state , while i freeze my ass off .
[native] consider this scenario : i am a male , and one day i choose to walk down the street wearing a wide brimmed hat , large dark sunglasses and a beard .
[non-native] however , i fully agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide for the following reasons .
[native] yeah , good luck with getting poland and albania back , ( or lmao , a part of germany , in your dreams putin ) , when you ca n't even get back your ukrainian brothers .
[native] also , imagine if the target where any other faith , say judaism or islam .
[native] what you fail to understand is russias very existence is at stake here , you think putin is just some crazy dude with no plan just trying to gobble up as much land as possible .
[native] very interesting , and in my opinion a very good thing , to see a general increase in feeling like a citizen of the eu .
[native] because there 's no reason to believe this fight is any different to every other fight there 's been throughout history .
[native] beyond a university with some ridiculous spending decisions , not a whole lot .
[native] what we 're seeing here across the board is a massive level of disillusionment with the parties in general and that has lead to a radical increase in support for left and far left candidates , as ireland is traditionally a rather right wing country both socially and economically ( with the exception being the bloated welfare handout system ) .
[native] you can just walk across the border because the communities on both sides of the border would all be of trsdtionally republican ( currently more `` ca n't we all just get along '' ) backgrounds .
[non-native] however , when we take lecture about our major , we do not obtain experience that we need to lives .
[native] > and going around with signs saying `` no popery '' .
[non-native] he have had aptitudes and abilities for the carear , he should want study and never leave his dream .
[native] it 's just that lately , the country has gone a bit batshit insane .
[non-native] as a result , in order to be successful and rise in the life , people should open up themselves to the new things and they should take risks while trying or learning new things .
[native] there have been cases of [ romanians illegally entering canada ] ( http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/ottawa-gets-tough-with-romanian-asylum-seekers/article5992117/ ) , but it seems to be relatively isolated .
[native] instead of acting to change the system itself , partially due to the game 's influence that `` rebellion against the system '' means killing shit , well , they react with how their brain has been influenced to react - total , directionless violence .
[native] it would n't * really * be scientists that directly control the probes , actually .
[native] he seems desperate , and normally when people are desperate they make irrational decisions .
[non-native] so the knowledge is always limited for both of them .
[non-native] on the other hand the tradional person who alwys do and repete the use the known methdo to do things will be never add anything to sicene and technology and they stel need other to learn the the new method to do thing
[non-native] in my opinion , a future vision of streets with only a few cars driving , is a positive one .
[native] you 'll miss me sometimes , when you do get me you 'll fail to convince people who either agree with me , sympathize with me , or have the cognitive faculty to recognize the irrelevance of the screenshot in a completely separate discussion , and over time , you will start to make an ass out of yourself , and alienate people in the subreddit to the point where people have just as much of a problem with `` that obnoxious guy who wo n't stop posting that screenshot '' as they do with `` that crazy guy who screams about right to live '' - with the difference being that the people you 've alienated are the intellectuals , and the ones i 've alienated are the dumb fucks who ca n't contribute anything except idiotic statements like `` nobody would prefer a shitty life over death herp derp . ''
[native] > however not only these small tax havens are a problem .
[non-native] if we concentrate on one subject specifically it will be very much useful for us so that we can know every thing about that subject perfectly .
[non-native] to manipulate the customer and giving him the illusion life can not continue without buying this product is a very common procedure nowadays .
[non-native] therefore , i prefer to understanding ideas than to concepts .
[native] the fact we 're still there , the fact we 're willing to risk thermonuclear warfare for small regions like the baltics and for the ideals of european integration , should ring true to how good allies we are .
[native] i 've considered your arguments , you asking people to consider them and then say ` for support , read 500 pages of pdf documents ' .
[native] what areas would the eu be able to tax ?
[non-native] as i used that shapoo , my hair started to fall down and had to rush to my doctor to help me in this .
[native] and social democracy , then yeah you guys make perfect sense .
[native] and , in case you are us citizen , you know how that one works , no ?
[native] constitutionalism would thus fall naturally out of parliamentary supremacy .
[native] although we pretty much replaced them as nuclear bombers with b-2s & b-1s an such , utilizing them mostly as conventional bombers * ( not a much better alternative when you want to drop a fuckton of bombs at one time in one place ) * , unlike russia who i 'm pretty sure still use theirs for nuclear delivery .
[non-native] second , studying many academic subjects give the students the opportunity to understand what they really like in order to make sure they choose a carrer that fits with their interestes .
[native] is that supposed to be rocky that putin is knocking out in [ this picture ?
[native] this is also true of britain , which is why the distinction is made .
[non-native] i know nowdays young people are busy with their own bussiness .
[non-native] i am really disagree about traveling in a group led by a guide for several reasons that are getting a book that is about where you are traveling instead of tour guide and being so relax during the trip insted of depending on someone .
[non-native] by making advertisements for a product better than the actual products , it drives people who thinks the advertisements are true to actually by the product .
[non-native] however , if they just tried something more , they could have found their talent and be more successful .
[non-native] other goverments like in china enhance the people living their to use bycicles to go all around the city by macking special tracks and signals only for bycicle users not to mention the secial parking rods that are placed in front of each building to make it much more esier for the people over there to park their bycicles safely and head on to their jobs .
[non-native] for example , when we learn about our history , if we just concentrated the concepts and ideas in the subject , we never learn about our curture and our emotions .
[native] this means that ttip will lead to the loss of at least one million jobs between the eu and us , whatever the level of ambition achieved .
[native] this happens in all countries regardless , there will always be poorer areas feeding off richer areas .
[non-native] when i went to korea with my friends , we did n't join a tour .
[non-native] for example , they try to give th audince the lowest price with anew package .
[native] yeah , the more you supplement other countries ' military budgets , the more they can get ahead in socioeconomic spending .
[non-native] in the second place , another chief and head reason i have chosen to put here is that if an innovative invention could be invented , the our cities would be less polluted .
[non-native] in making some decisions a group of members form as commitee and they try their best for making the good decision .
[native] i almost never hear anything when it 's muslim on muslim violence , but when it 's the jews , they ca n't shut up .
[native] 2 ) there are legal ways to leave ukraine and crimea could never muster the support to do them .
[non-native] on the other hand everyone has some information about the daily life .
[native] which should have been our wake up call . . read this : https://www.nirs.org/reactorwatch/natureandnukes/petrulemaking262011.pdf this is a global problem .
[non-native] i think understanding ideas and concepts are more important than learning facts because of two reasons ; effectiveness to another proplem , and make a considerated person .
[non-native] that 's the evolution process of creation which is a permanent process .
[native] the reason people do that is to give a better understanding of their cultural upbringing and view of life .
[native] because you keep trying to change the subject , which is genocide .
[non-native] when u r going to write a one computer program on paper then its understand ideas and concepts is very difficulty .
[non-native] here i want to share my ideas about this subject .
[native] the shinners are too cowardly to do anything other than line their own pockets .
[native] for a long time , blacks were not a part of established american society in any real sense .
[non-native] my personal experiences and actual observations of life have led me to conclusion that companies spend a lot of money to broadcast their products even though their products does n't seem much better than they really are .
[non-native] we have time and time again seen the breathtaking speed with which global ideas are fished out of the chesspool of globalization .
[native] such a shame she did n't sit on the real one so we could have actual photos .
[native] why are you making distinctions between types of genital mutilation based on gender , how about everybody just stops mutilating their newborns and let them grow up to make whatever decision they want when they are an adult .
[non-native] everybody would understand a topic in another way and a comparison would be impossible .
[native] you do n't need to assume my figures are correct - you can simply look up the net contributions of the member states .
[non-native] by summarizing the above points there is a need to have a broad knowledge of many acedemic subjects and specialization in one specific subject because , if a person is interested in his own field he may go that side and others can get some benefit by having atleast some knowledge about other subjects .ideas and concepts will play a major role in the development any product or component .
[native] the nuclear power plants were already up and running , the precautionary principle does n't apply .
[non-native] this is the main reason why i think young people hardly help others in their communities .
[non-native] on the other hand , i think a small part of young people dose not have or can not make enough time to helping their communities .
[native] this situation described in this article would get laughed out of the office so fast that the bride would n't even have time to pack her bags before she would be deported .
[native] no , i was trying to demonstrate where their biases came from , not ` tarnish ' them somehow .
[native] the eu as a whole seems to have created 651k jobs over the last two years .
[native] if that 's really what you think , then i guess i have nothing but pity .
[native] yup , it is mostly for ultra long range target shooting .
[non-native] now a days there are so much markets that are compiting between them , that the product that has the best marketing strategy is the one with the biggest revenues .
[native] - ireland 's workforce ( english language and high education ) found it far easier to move to the uk , australia , canada etc and find skilled work compared to some of the rest of the eurozone .
[native] it 's made going for morning coffee my favourite part of the day .
[native] but even then , things rarely get more heated than some friendly ( ish ) verbal abuse .
[native] by pushing the buttons on ukraine & rallying eu countries to oppose russia over it , it spikes their overall plan , or the very least delays it .
[native] if scots had answered ` yes ' to the question they could have been in a situation where alex salmond has to renegotiate eu membership ( or bring in the imf to fix finances ) and leave scotland less independent than it was before .
[native] you might not want there to be any limits at all , but you are in a tiny minority .
[non-native] so that they can work during their free time .
[native] what about the one about basque women being impossible to get with ?
[non-native] i this tendency continues , older people are concerned about a lot of issues that an adolescent would never think of .
[native] i did n't know it was possible to start a russian word with ' Ñ ' , i 've never seen it before .
[native] ireland and most of europe does not have free speech like the us .
[non-native] so it is always worth it to find a tour that has additionally some points away from the usual places .
[non-native] moreover , there are lot other priviledges that follows a successful person .
[native] you mean there 's actually * stuff * between the m25 and the square mile !
[native] contrast that to the practices of walmart or royal dutch shell and i 'd much rather see apple-style corporate leadership .
[native] * do you just have a macro that says this every time someone asks you ?
[non-native] so i had to get the knowledge of nature of gas .
[native] it 's only on grounds of compassion that they 're allowed , but people 's tolerance has its limits .
[non-native] therefore , people would rather work a part-time job than community work .i agrees that it is better to board knowledge in one specialized specific subject .
[non-native] every year , more and more number of cars are being sold across the globe .
[native] they gave a human rights award to ghadaffi and think qatar is a becon of human rights .
[non-native] even if having a good memory is a quality , it ca n't be sufficient .
[non-native] it is also safe to travel in a group and with a person who is aware of good and bad neighborhoods .
[native] however it is , at least in ireland , nowhere near the figure i recently heard of ~ 75 % adult obesity rates in america .
[native] why is he * pretending * he can make russia self-sufficient and strong ?
[non-native] third , travel in a group with tour guide makes trip too touristic .
[non-native] second , young people have tremendous peer pressure in school .
[native] the moscow times is known for having an anti-putin slant .
[non-native] each people have different skills ; some of them are think better , some of them have the physical ability .
[non-native] so usually young people enjoy their life more than older do .
[non-native] each and every course of today wether you take a science or art or technology projects and the field works are introduced .
[non-native] so , there is hardly anytime left over for joy in life .
[native] in the meantime obviously you 're not required to like it , but it seems a little strange to get hot and bothered about it .
[native] it 's a bunch of people that fuck amongst themselves , fuck with foreigners , and constantly have changing genes .
[non-native] beside all of these if u have grandchildren and if they likes u that makes u happier .
[native] the greatest irony of people calling others who are against uncontrolled immigration `` racist '' and `` right wing '' is the fact that they fail to take into consideration the refugees ' political viewpoints .
[non-native] it is more comfortable for me to travel alone or with friends .
[native] new zealand saw increased labour productivity from scrapping its agricultural subsidies , and we would see similar things here from the well managed farms .
[non-native] owing to the fact that you can never predict what things might come into being , a tool that is emission-free and envrionment-friendly may be tapped in the next few seconds .
[non-native] therefore , regarding the schedule of the trip , the tour guide will make a plan in order to visit the maximum number of places in the country .
[native] voting green or conservative does not make a brexit more likely in the same way as a ukip vote .
[non-native] as an example , an old person can go and have a concert with his girl friend or wife till down without being someone exceptional .
[native] the issue is what do we do going forward ?
[native] > when no american tailfins are available , raggare are sometimes forced to improvise , like using a mercedes .
[non-native] this results in less interaction of the children with the society and hence , less concern for the community .
[native] we could affect them just as well as we could affect israel .
[non-native] biologically speaking , the metabolic rates in the older people are very slow and thus will be left with very less energy to work with .
[non-native] to get to be familar with new things makes us to remove the feeling of fun .
[non-native] i like to going to the shopping when i want to buy some clothes which i getting to be a favorite one .
[non-native] i disagree wiht the idea of learning facts because i do not think that is useful because that will be something you learn and did not understood , but for some students or people is better when they got the idea of the concepts , and for some others is better if is something clear for them , something that they have an idea of what is triying to understand , for example for me is more useful if i understand what the concepts and ideas are about and in that way i can always remember that , another example will be , like i have a friend she always learns facts , and at the hour of the test is more difficult for her , than it is for me but the thing is that i understood the ideas and concepts of what is the topic or theme about , but sometimes is better when you learn facts and that is all because you did not understood the concept or the idea of what they are triying to teach you .
[native] bertie `` i 'm a socialist '' ahern and all that .
[native] there are racist acts in a legal sense in the us in the form of hate crimes .
[native] in the same way , while it seems as though you 're appearing to be stupid on purpose , i 've got you tagged as ` christian youth idiot ' which makes be believe that you are actually genuinely stupid , so let 's not accuse each other of lying , you 'll only get confused .
[native] i provided you with a link ( recent ) showing they 're using more coal .
[native] why dont you try and also convince countries like france to change tune .
[native] if the added costs of not being part of the eu exceed as little as 1 % , you 'll lose money .
[non-native] also , young people have longer time to do anything .
[non-native] since they are in the business to make people believe , they create some ideas or images which seem more attractive to the customers on the television while misrepresenting the product .
[non-native] if you think , speak , and behave like any other people or in the routinal way you are used to , then how could you make changes and reach the top ?
[native] i 'm no expect , and this is just off the top of my head : * the european fishing industry would n't agree with your statement * it would add another nato member to the eu * geo-politically it would extend the eu reach to the north atlantic region above the arctic circle , which may not be a big deal now but if the predicted power race for the resources in the arctic kicks off it will matter a lot
[native] no , it 's not recognized as sovereign by a majority of the world .
[non-native] this is a very important subject becaus that question has been between people for a long time .
[non-native] of course it is possible to older people to enjoy their lifes too , but they often wait too long until starting with that .
[non-native] by becoming a specialist in a particular area you could do wonders to that particular field in a small period of time .
[native] let 's say if a couple would only have the resources to raise one child after the surrogacy .
[native] > russia attacking a sovereign nation over false pretences can in no way be blamed on the attractiveness of europe and its values but should be directed to the utterly delusional attacker .
[native] of course since we have nuclear weapons on the table none of that matters .
[non-native] in my view this can be checked by making laws related to vehicle pollution more strict and punishable .
[non-native] at time crises it always better to learn than wasting time in understanding it , because you are never sure that after spending so much time in understanding it , will you really be able to understand it .
[native] there 's also a lot of european money parked in switzerland , a non-eu member .
[native] there 's no official language countrywide , but at the state level there 's 22 official languages .
[native] > there are so many parallels between what happened in croatia in 1991/95 and what is happening in ukraine .
[native] and how do you send an instagram with one of those old-fashioned analogue phones , by the way ?
[native] but then again it looked like scotland would vote yes at one point if you just listened to how vocal the yes supporters were it made it seem like the whole country was going to vote yes , it turns out that in the end a vote is a vote , no matter how loud you shout about making it .
[non-native] the first reason for my belief is that we can learn more and apply the subjects more .
[native] > so we should kick out the multinationals then and that will improve things ?
[native] they will be confined to their home 24/7 if the burqa is banned .
[native] i also remember that in my final year of junior school in 1989 that my teacher asked us to collect newspaper articles about the fall of communism in each warsaw pact country .
[non-native] for example , when the history is examined , one can easly see that there were lots of mad scientists who dreamed lots of mad things including `` navigation in time '' , but if one looks at the results , there is nothing to applaude .
[non-native] she made efforts to learn why this happened and she felt that their are some charge particles which are responsiponsible for that shock .
[native] no real helicopters to use on it , but i 'm sure it 'll act as a nice deterrent to keep those pesky spanish fishermen out of our territorial waters .
[native] the word ( and accusations ) are meaningless , just a cheap way to try and delegitimize someones arguments .
[native] this is almost backwards from what i would do .
[non-native] someone who is working hard on a topic might become unable to keep a clear sight of the whole situation .
[native] i 'm not sure which sector you are in , but in my sector there have been salary rises and many hires over the last 12 months .
[native] is n't it time we started seriously blaming extremists like the front national for being so racist and exclusionary that it pushes these young men away from the mainstream ?
[native] the muslim world did not have an autogenic reform like in europe .
[non-native] our worlds preservations are dying and its resorces are vanishing into thin air , and why do you think that is , just because we want to drive our cars .
[native] i have my doubts that europe as a whole could bail out italy and spain ...
[native] so , in other words , he helped to design the instrument that killed him .
[native] this is a much more pertinent question , as it appears that ukraine apparently needs no evil super power controlling it to introduce totalitarian laws gagging their local population .
[native] ah sorry , i thought that you meant `` printed '' on the receipt and not written by hand - you are correct that you write the amount on the receipt .
[non-native] for example , bill gaze , the most rich person in the world , i think it 's a good sample for people who seccessed .
[native] last time a austrian wanted polish clay it did n't end well .
[non-native] for example , now the earth have some problems to warm atomother .
[non-native] when people try new things there are always a lot of risk .
[native] i do n't see anything nazi really ; they do n't persecute jews or proclaim white superiority , and most definitely are not german ultranationalists .
[non-native] i definitely agree with this statement and below i would explain some of the reasons .
[non-native] today lots of products are constructed or build up in a complete different area .
[native] bear in mind this data is from feb. 2007 , so over 7 years ago , and it 's only based off 800 calls ( ~ 400 unsuccessful phone calls were made ) .
[native] the fact that the eu can tell our elected officials what to do at all is already somewhat controversial , any example of this annoys people and gains media attention because of this .
[non-native] if you are a busy student because of your study , which one will you choose between going to theater to watch exciting movies and working for your community ?actually , i do n't think that the statement `` youg people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communties '' , is completely truth .
[native] hmm ... ( imo greenpeace is * far * worse compared to modern communist parties in democratic countries ; they openly use obviously illegal methods and often support token environmentalism with no good effect on the environment ( anti-nuclear being the most obvious example ; save < insert-random-not-so-endangered-not-so-ecologically-important-species > being another ) )
[native] he is not even the fully retarded one , thats why he won .
[non-native] study economics , you can also specialize in one specific subject but most people end there studies at the master degree which leads
[non-native] cars are very usefull to move quickly from a place to another and quite every family seems to be able to afford one or even two or three of this means of transportation .
[native] alas , i do n't think the eu and national governments have the political capital to enact any such change , so we 're stuck in a kind of limbo of bad solutions .
[non-native] due to the coordination between friends they use to dowhatever they want which we will not see in case of older people .
[native] there are n't too many unskilled germans , french or austrians headed to the uk .
[non-native] especially for raising countries it is quiet hard to think about such a problem .
[non-native] i have to admit that the advertisements are essential assets for any businesses of late .
[non-native] as regards the cars i think that since one of the major problem today is the pollution produced by cars maybe in the futureb cars will be fewer .
[native] it 's coming through dg trade on the impetus of the council of europe , and by brussels i mean the legitimacy of the eu .
[non-native] a person who is in the position to take risks should ever be aware that things can always go bad ; therefore risks should always lean on some quality the risk taker posesses .
[non-native] the ministry of education introduces the `` community involvement programme '' ( short-termed cip ) , where students must contribute to their communities in some form , and the time of their contribution is reported by the related organisations .
[native] i am just saying it may be time now to start preparing for the worse , as canada is trying to find every new market it can to distance ourselves from reliance on the usa .
[native] i would agree that melbourne and sydney work , but i do n't think you can point to a 90 % white country and characterize it as multicultural .
[non-native] in other words , these are situations that force people to take the car .
[native] maybe i just got a bad batch of tourists that week and they 're normally alright ?
[native] eh , should n't be that difficult to create a checkbox that sends written emails the next morning instead .
[native] i 'm pretty sure there is much more than 70 that left from canada .
[non-native] if the oil becomes harder to find , then it becomes also more and more expensive .
[non-native] all the young people who are studying at university may not be rich enough to pay their semester fees and those will have to pay the fees by working at part time jobs such as cafetaria , assistantship , etc .
[non-native] by accessing solutions , we could face various kinds of obstacle .
[non-native] consequently these examples give evidence that companies are unwilling to disclose their weaknesses in advertisement .is really everything you see in advertisments is better ?
[non-native] as stated above , i took the environment class in hitotsubashi university .
[native] everybody who knows me reasonably well kinda compensates for my bluntness though : / am i unusually blunt online as well ?
[non-native] he 's job is working with the computer , he do n't need to repair the coffee offer because he is n't professional about this .
[non-native] and this experience makes me suggest that understanding ideas and concepts is much more important than knowing facts .
[non-native] this is my first job and so i have never done something like this before in university , but i learned some facts about the aspects a business case has to contain in my finance classes .
[non-native] therefore , people always pay more than the real value of the product since they are paying the advertisement 's fee .
[non-native] with this cake you 're gonna buy only for a dolar we give you a chance to get in relations with enormously beautiful girls !i totaly agree with that statement .
[native] political purposes like `` these guys are big contributors to our party and need our help '' .
[non-native] therefore i strongly agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
[native] they tend to idealize the `` old country '' and resist anything that diverges from the ideal .
[non-native] sometimes other results that students can not expect from the ideas and concepts which they understand may happen .
[non-native] i think that it is the same at a smaller level .
[native] to be honest bro , from my point of view it seems you are trying to do everything in your power to justify the deaths of innocent people .
[native] this was clearly not done to remember and honour the loss of the cities , but to provoke .
[native] > the european ombudsman , emily o'reilly , has called on the council of the european union to publish the eu negotiating directives for the on-going transatlantic trade and investment partnership ( ttip ) negotiations with the us .
[non-native] this is the other way of learning while making experience .
[non-native] so , todays science and technology has many complicated concepts were students are finding difficult to learn it .
[non-native] students should learn fact than ideas because they live in the world which tells that what recently is going on ask them about it . .
[native] a majority of the world views it as illegal and crimea as ukranian .
[non-native] some people think that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
[non-native] even more , they often teased and descriminated by their friends .
[non-native] young people will make their time to do more interesting things that they like , helping communities is a rule that every day and every minutes should do , communities was the person who live there and not only young people should care .
[non-native] first of all , internet has become an important factor in students life .
[non-native] normally people wants see everything new in their life they do n't do tgo with their routine work in life .
[native] this would n't even be a big deal if an israeli politician said it .
[non-native] being young or old to have more happiness , which is best to have fun ?
[non-native] they can learn atractive and new things , and some of them are really abusoluted in things of other countries .
[non-native] first , people want to travel to be free from their ordinary lives such as time limits and rules .
[native] nz also lacks poisonous animals and it 's slightly warmer
[non-native] the first of all , it mean many oppotunity that student choose their major or future .
[non-native] i think young people pays a lot of time to their own communities .
[non-native] that is why a lot of the young people try to find jobs .
[native] i wonder what made you think kiwis are obsessed with money ...
[non-native] for example , if you want to improve in your work life , you have to do tasks which you have n't done already .
[native] putin does n't want to lose face : `` hey , we are importing milk from belarus , not from poland , those nato loving pricks ! ''
[native] the number of people that will use it to sit at home and do nothing is very small , i would n't say no to the entire system because of those few people .
[non-native] so when a company is looking for a person who can solve a specific problem they would rather hire a specialist than a person who only has broad knownledge of a specific problem .
[native] the problem is that the western world accumulated that debt during the boom and is trying to pay for it during the bust .
[non-native] on the other hand , whether you want to go to the `` top '' , in this case , it 's not enought a general knowledge but is much better if you have a specialize , to have a personal specialization , to be unique , to be different to the other .
[native] it may come when they negotiate terms with the separatists .
[native] i looked it up for you :) ** article 32 ** in carrying out the tasks entrusted to it under this chapter the commission shall be guided by : ( a ) the need to promote trade between member states and third countries ; ( b ) developments in conditions of competition within the union in so far as they lead to an improvement in the competitive capacity of undertakings ; ( c ) the requirements of the union as regards the supply of raw materials and semi-finished goods ; in this connection the commission shall take care to avoid distorting conditions of competition between member states in respect of finished goods ; ( d ) the need to avoid serious disturbances in the economies of member states and to ensure rational development of production and an expansion of consumption within the union ** article 63 ** within the framework of the provisions set out in this chapter , all restrictions on the movement of capital between member states and between member states and third countries shall be prohibited .
[non-native] they are still more in a process of personal development than older people are .
[non-native] considering all of the above factors , although there are many way of thinking , i 'd like to choose the idea that older people enjoy life more than younger people .underastanding idieas are far more important than knowing the fact .
[non-native] the marketing director must also have knowledge in finance to fix his budgets .
[non-native] when we relate technology to the economic conditions of any country , as there is an improvement in the technology and hence it would create employment for the people there by the economic status of the induvidual increases and hence the car being the symbol of luxury everyone want to travel in a car so in my view the usage of number of cars would drastically increase in the next twenty years .
[native] if you spend the same percentage as israel ( 6.2 % ) you would match south korea , if you spend like saudi arabia ( 8.9 % ) , you 'd match germany 's expenditure .
[non-native] thing which are byhearted can slip from the mind is very easy but the thing or the subject whcih is explained to student and telling what is the concept and the idea behind the subject then that is sure that will stay for longer time in student mind .
[non-native] during that time i saw so many poor people , with old and dirty clothes , who were very hungry or who needed medicine .
[native] nato does not require political union from its members , so how a future without a use would precipitate nato collapse i do n't fathom .
[native] you mean a loyal part of poland for centuries that happened to have germans living there .
[native] militarily and diplomatically the uk is on a different scale from italy and spain .
[native] > one actually lives in holland and will come back to the uk to vote ukip , which says it all really .
[native] it creates a fairly justified victim complex and a narrative of the old struggling a losing battle against the new .
[native] we 're number two , we 're number two !
[native] however in the short term it would be a painful breakup , and scotland has nowhere near the economic resources as the rest of the uk , considering the oil has nearly run out .
[native] catalonia is the most indebted community in spain after all .
[non-native] for example we might watch tv at least one hour per day .
[native] there may be some prevailing trends , but they are by no means rules , nor are they necessary or even just sufficient conditions that have to be met .
[non-native] we were not burn as a fully experienced educated person .
[non-native] in addition , i will argue over the issue in the following reasons .
[non-native] not many people want to take risk for something .
[native] they 're not claiming italian or irish citizenship and anybody who knows american english knows that 's not what their intent is .
[non-native] when asked who will enjoy life more between youth and older people , i will incline to youth because of their energy , enthusiasm , tenderness , dareness and zeal to learn new and pleasant ones .
[non-native] they also arrange some campaings that would attract the people .
[native] if the tories do n't win the next election , they 'll blame it on the rise of ukip and replace their leader with a euro-skeptic one .
[native] the north the place were saxony , brandenburg and the hanseatic league is located being far more protestant .
[non-native] nevertheles instead in some cases old people are more happier than young people .
[non-native] within these frames , i think , the fact that youth can not assign enough time for helping their communities is mainly based on the environmental conditions as a whole and some measures can be taken by the society in order to prevent this alienation of young people to their societies .i agree .
[native] and ps wont even need any effort to pull the racist card .
[non-native] therefore , i think young people shold help their communities .i agree with the opinion of those who believe that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
[native] ;-) > and when looking for a job i saw plenty of articles that the average graduate income had dropped by 11 % in the last 5 years .
[non-native] secondly , i have to admit that products seen during advertisements look much better than they really are .
[native] edit : i assume people are downvoting me because i 'm boasting .
[native] you seem to have turned me into some [ bogeyman ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2h0oi3/ttip_and_tisa_big_pressure_to_trade_away_privacy/ckob2t9 ) and [ bitching about me in other subs ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2hal5o/eli5_its_been_nearly_2_decades_since_nafta_has/ckr6k98 ) .
[non-native] in conclusion , according my life porpuse i disagree with that statement but sumirize it depends by your schedule 's life , your dreams , your choice 's life .
[non-native] i think that car , even today , is one of the most means of transportation used and i think that this means will be even in the future , even if much people prefer use alternative means , like for example train or airplane in order to speed the travel .
[native] isil is not a recognized state , not is the uk at war with them or in a military coalition against them .
[native] purely out of respect for that woman 's dignity .
[non-native] moreover , some advertisements do not only lack information on possible defaults of the product , but they intend to make the consumer forget all those default by emphasizing so much on the qualities of the product .
[non-native] as you can see , many yong people are very busy about their school , and some of them are not interested in their community .
[native] there 's only so much spectrum which can be used for data , and if data was priced close to its actual marginal cost to the carrier , the network would be overloaded as fuck and useless to everyone .
[native] also the amount of money it would cost to property care for nuclear weapons .
[non-native] the first sentence get opportunities for whom is able to organize himself .
[native] wow , pleased to see there is another pÃ©cs appreciator here ...
[native] someone flew a drone over the pitch with an albanian/kosovo flag for a few minutes .
[native] > according to the bath house , the denial was based on `` regular patrons ' fear of contracting aids '' .
[non-native] in conclusion , in my opinion , the best way to travel is indeed in a group led by a tour guide as you get to experience a wider range or varieties of sight-seeing places without getting lost and to experience different sorts of local culture .the advantages and disadvantages of group travelling led by a guide are many .
[native] assuming for the sake of argument that your figure is correct , that 'd be about 8 % of the gdp of slovenia .
[native] the only ones that will be going back to syria are those in the camps in the neighbouring countries .
[non-native] his magical realism attempted to overcome the limit of a novel by utilizing a totally different way of writing .
[native] also , the adding to the uk finances ( which i do n't dispute ) is not conclusive .
[native] every time something like this comes out i wonder how much they believe their own talking points .
[native] these acts guarantee a repair , replacement , or refund ** from the point of sale ** if the good or service is faulty , not as advertised , or `` unfit for the intended use '' .
[non-native] to conclude , i would say that this is a central question in education field .
[non-native] i do not think so , since i believe that the advertisement is a way to lure the cumstomers to buy and to maximize the profit .
[non-native] thus , the scientist invented a missile launcher that can be installed on a submarine , which apparently could attack the main land of america with extreme accuracy .
[non-native] he or she can not have a right thinking before learning how to understand ideas and concepts .
[native] they use a reflexive cynicism to shortcut having to actually think about the world .
[native] that 's true , but that does n't mean that people think `` omg murica behind it '' .
[native] you do n't think canadians were invested into the company ?
[non-native] but actually , will those products ' quality is as good as those stars ?
[native] i 'm not familiar with the state of anarchism .
[non-native] another reason is that people who provided a new prodyuct earlier than its competitors becomes famous at the for example , toyota , japanese car company , succeed its business by producing new type of car , high-brid car .
[non-native] i 've heard about a lot of student failing on their major work areas just because that they have only the facts they have been thaught .
[non-native] if people go someplace , people use some trancepotation .
[native] french conservatives , for example , are highly protectionist .
[non-native] in my opinion , every part of our lives offers opportunities and challenges us with its own problems .
[non-native] not only review the knowledge , but also learne new knowledge during the time .
[native] we do n't even get taught sex education , then we 're turned away for blood and organ donation because we 're disproportionately likely to contract hiv .
[native] i could equally mock the eu supporters as saying `` muh phone charges !
[non-native] they both are the great invention which bring large convenience to our societies .
[non-native] morally speaking , the companies shoudl keep a good repuation about the companies .
[non-native] i believe one can only really enjoy when the work is done and although life can be exiting and pleasant some time , everybody always get up in the morning and start again to built up .
[non-native] they should study on school every business day , and students should learne many things .
[non-native] the education system in our country is also the same .
[non-native] people uses their cars a lot becuase is the most cheapest transport and you can use it wherever you want .
[native] because that 's all you ever do , you just post copious amounts of links and never make any logical connections between them .
[non-native] for example the advertisements call people to jump from over the mountain , or eat some insects like fear factor program , i know there is a warning in the program , but the people do like them exactly , and they got hurts .
[native] i 'd much rather work on a good sustainable domestic economy thanks
[non-native] as far as i know , subsitite resource that appied to modern transportation is only electricity .
[non-native] since my coach moved to new swimming club , new coach came my club .
[native] as is every other issue a `` distraction '' from another one .
[native] some had millions of goats , others only had a few thousand .
[native] * migration watch chairman sir andrew green told the bbc : `` if you take all eu migration including those who arrived before 2001 what you find is this : you find by the end of the period they are making a negative contribution and increasingly so .
[native] are n't these guys similar to those montagsdemonstrationen people in germany ?
[non-native] recent studies shows that the slap suits filed in the court regarding community work are carried out by the youth .
[non-native] this can be said from my own experiences and from what i see from other people 's experiences .
[non-native] for example , it is a tradition to get your drivers license when you turn the age of 16 in america .
[non-native] althouth , some people are disagree with her actitud .
[native] it 's not like trading one source of electricity for another , there are many other factors .
[native] i think the issue with blackface is more the historical cultural context , that is that in the us blackface is symbolic of the discrimination against black actors , as well as the racist caricatures that were presented at the time .
[native] that being said , because of time limits and weird requirements , our safety net programs are n't really a viable long term option for many people .
[native] it reveals a fundamental lack of curiosity and interest in the world .
[native] no country * has * to ratify the treaty .
[non-native] however , both of them use to pass the exam but using diferrent ways .
[native] then the terms of the trade agreement come in and bam , lawsuit by international company claiming unfair advantage .
[native] and as if by magic , here 's a comment from the [ bbc have your say section about this story ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-29910497?postid=120722321#comment_120722321 ) : > blatant pro eu propaganda > ideal story for the pro immigration bbc , no wonder they jumped on it and gave it headline space > the lack of facts , presented or available make this nothing more than political spin
[non-native] her is sometime like unhappy , but sometime not so .
[native] admitting you have a big problem and trying to fix it or denying you have a small issue and burying your head in the sand ?
[non-native] as far as i am concerned , i am fully convinced that fewer cars will be used in twenty years after taking all factors into consideration .
[non-native] for example a basketball coach could face the situation in wich he has to decide to try something new and unusual to win a game , such changing the defense schemes that help him win many games in the past .
[non-native] that is a wonderful opportunity , especially for those who did n't have the opportunity to complete their studies .
[non-native] for most young people they like to do hard or dangeruce activities .
[non-native] some people try to learn lots of academic subjects , on the other hand some people try to learn only one academic subject for whole life ,
[native] culturally as well i think the majority of people are of the opinion that a united ireland is n't the optimum choice anymore .
[native] they were temporarily shut down for a time , experts were called in to determine how safe they were , and then a number were arbitrarily shut down .
[non-native] some people agree that young people do not give enough time to help their communities nowadays .
[native] you should learn about a subject before you speak .
[non-native] i can not fully agree or disagree with it .this is a very diplomatic statment to say that the usage of the cars would be decresec in the future .
[non-native] instead , no everybody has the same difinition of `` young people '' and furtherwards we have to make differences in `` young people ' : some of them are very interesting in what happen in their communities and invest time in it and other young people do n't worry about it !
[native] just burn some of all that money you own to keep warm .
[native] presumably you mean the area where the city of byzantium was founded , not the entirety of anatolia , or it 'd be fairly redundant .
[native] i actually went over to the / r/ukraina subreddit a few weeks ago ( it seems to be the main ukrainian language subreddit , do n't speak a word , used google translate to make sense of it ) , but the mods seemed to have stickied a thread there from some guy advertising to hire recruits from some volunteer brigade/unit to fight in eastern ukraine .
[native] unfortunately i see this tendency among a lot of european fans .
[native] mongols , muslims in spain and the ottomans , to name a few .
[non-native] having nothing in the mind only to be successful in life , parents could forget their children .
[non-native] it does not help you to know everything about a knowledge , if you are not able to work in a project group .
[native] heck , my bet is that in 20 years ( a relatively short time considering the ussr imploded a quarter of a century ago ) , russia 's 2014 borders will be containing a few smaller countries .
[native] this number does n't include the countless number of people who learned french as a second language ( due to career aspirations , love for the language , etc. )
[non-native] itrying to do your best is what sociey asks you .
[non-native] second , i think human beings can not live alone .
[non-native] this is just another reason why i agree with the issued statement .
[non-native] we `` rock and roll '' with music we play .
[native] she may be wrong to feel like that , but is it really her fault after likely being indoctrinated from birth by a misogynistic sexist religion ?
[native] bangladesh has 1033 people per km ^ 2 , that is , 10 people per hectare .
[native] i 've run into a number of polish people that have probably never met a muslim in their life , but are convinced that all muslims are evil and go on rants against islam .
[non-native] now i hear the news that car company are trying to make safety cars that can stop immediately when someone or something suddenly appear in front of the cars .
[non-native] it is after all the question of surviving in this highly competitve world .
[non-native] as a results , learning about facts and understand the points is most important than just understanding ideas and concepts .i disagree with the statement that young people nowadays donot give enough time to helping their communities.the reasons which i quote for supporting this statement are as follows :
[native] the sioux nation was represented by their chief , joseph brings plenty ; his son cole brings plenty ; and evelyne serais , a native of france now living in the united states , who has devoted her life in service to native americans .
[native] holy crap , that 's some fairy tale looking shit there .
[native] it 's just the burden of proof against many roma ` thieves ' is not sufficient to warrant their arrest in most cases .
[native] that 'll swing it against russia a little bit .
[non-native] we might not have enough time to look over everything in a week by ourselves .
[non-native] to a student studying history it is very important to learn the facts , which is part of his knowledge .
[non-native] as a result , the company will fail as people got a bad idea about it .
[non-native] the poloson is not good for as and not dad for the envaurmant becouse the ( co2 ) , kill the fish and evry thning live ander wotar , also he brok the ( ozon ) , then becom some rise sun not good for our sken .
[native] ( i ) avoiding the effect of one or more provisions of united kingdom immigration law or the immigration rules ; .
[native] and maltese ( a semetic language ) , and turkic languages ( i.e.
[non-native] for example , there is a political party called shiv sena in india which is mostly comprises of young students .
[native] you just link to it and try and pass it off as proof that it 's bad .
[native] alas , i did n't focus much on the economic union , so i did n't cite that paper specifically and ca n't point you to it .
[non-native] as a coclusion ; as the time passes we learn and get surprised about the wideness of the universe but the days we are living is not that as in the 17 th century to sit at home and try to get some formulas about diferent sciences /currently , because of the rising oil demand in the would-be next-gen superpower china and india , there is a rise in the demand of car as well .
[native] i know that some laws and regulations are to be standardized so trade can flow freely but it is becoming too much .
[native] russia does n't have the same sort of ties to finland as to ukraine , but i think it 's fair to say that putin has nearly annihilated the mutual goodwill and trust that had built up over the past few decades .
[native] only one company , a foreign one , uses this additive , and sues the government .
[native] when challenged , you respond by providing links to 60 page pdfs without giving any context or telling us what we should be looking for , not even providing a page reference .
[non-native] however , in recently , they are very busy to do learn many things to earn the good school .
[non-native] having so helps him to know what fileld he is his intrested in .
[non-native] when i was young , one of my classmates was interested in math .
[native] although personally , i think it might be because we 've never had our arses truly handed to us in a war and needed a foreign power to liberate us , so we 've never had a generation grateful for foreigners showing up .
[non-native] however , we should not be very opitimistic about this .
[native] i realize that the united nations like to consider themselves masters of the universe , but i disagree with them on this point .
[non-native] otherwise you are a normal , static person .it is more important for students ro understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because the students can get more experiences and learn to study independently from understand ideas and concepts .
[native] the rise in debt has to halt with possibly significantly more adverse effects on china 's rate of growth than today 's consensus expects .
[non-native] the main reason behind this is that , now in this accelerating world we ca n't excell in an area or field unless we are very specific in that work .
[native] people literally say things like `` omg this law must not pass , it 'll be us-level < negative-word-here > ''
[non-native] but my grandpa , who ca n't use the computer , only watch tv at home for fun .
[native] depends on where you go :p . not many people live in the places with beautiful scenery , lol .
[native] but they ca n't , except in the case of isds provisions where foreign companies can do so .
[native] now whether or not you agree with that is another discussion altogether .
[non-native] therefore , i disagree with the statement .a successful human would try different newer things in his life than the older things he is used to do .
[non-native] these things have become essential for the human society and play great role in day to day life .
[native] i guess you did n't pay attention to the last conflict .
[non-native] we tend to base on our experience to behave in this way .
[non-native] you would probably have to dine in large restaurants mosty for tourists because local food establishment where they have delicious food tend to lack space to host a group .
[non-native] for example , they would looking about the hotels , where to eat , what are the attractions , and so on .
[native] because , if there 's one thing that will deter china in their territorial disputes with japan & the phillipines , and if there 's one thing that will preserve our relationship with all our other allies in the region , it 'll be by putting them all on the backburner because we 're distracted with something half-way around the world .
[native] than america will probably respond with a tactical nuke or two , and then so on & so on until we 're all living through a nuclear holocaust or somebody decided to give in & de-escalate before the icbms get launched .
[non-native] my opinion is also based on the fact that public transportation is already well developed , except in cities where there is a possibility of building an undergrown net .
[non-native] well , first at all the general picture is lost .
[non-native] but when you are not sure abt your strengths , it leads you very doubtful becuse you are not sure of your capabilities .
[non-native] in primay school we usually had a class teacher which taught us all subjects .
[non-native] it is possible to see many university students voluntarily participating in clubs where they have the opportunity to help children , people with disabilities and people who are in need .
[non-native] another example is that they are not likely to share the burden with community members .
[non-native] all the world leaders are also subjected to risk of their lifes but the dont step back from their posts .
[native] plus nothing is worse than crawling over fatties to get to good seats .
[non-native] in other words , their lives are more appreaciated and high-classed emotionally and psychologically .
[non-native] but , some people , in order to become more and more famous , will take too much risks .
[non-native] the contrast is true , when the people in a particular society do n't care about each other then we should'n expect a guy show up and say he want to help .
[native] the uk is a nuclear power and a permanent member of the unsc .
[non-native] success not only means to be happy in terms of wealth , fame and appreciation , it also has a lot of bearing to self-satisfaction and the feeling of being at peace with oneself .
[non-native] so they try to enjoy it for their own life .
[non-native] the people who watch the tv alot some times they watch the ad and say it might be a good product .
[non-native] actually , if you take risk to succeed in your life , it would induce issues such as financial issues .
[non-native] for illusturation , turkey has a lot of unemploy peoples who make same job .
[non-native] i can support my statement with few explainations or reasons and examples .
[non-native] also the one thing that will never go away is the enjoyment one gets while driving a car .
[native] > you 're arguing against the cap of 30-40 years ago .
[non-native] next reason is that people can develope themselves by trying .
[non-native] so my opinion is that there will be much less cars than now .
[non-native] i am aware that advertisements are exagerated and sometimes full of lies but i can not deny that i am a victim of this trend .the problem is if it is better to have a generic academic preparation or to have a specialization in one specific subject .
[non-native] new cars are bought just when the former one is over .
[native] 99 % of farms survived , suggesting there was n't devastation in any sector .
[non-native] the new inventions being made on cars does not even limit us with the fuel that we utilize in driving the car .

[native] i do n't know where you got the data for that but unemployment has been falling steadily for a while now and the protest was over water charges been very poorly implemented .
[native] but beyond that , i think it would be difficult to design any kind of statistical analysis that definitively proves national courts are biased against investors , but there are plenty of single cases that seem to indicate that is the case .
[non-native] this air pollution does not only affect future generations , but we as well feel already the consequences , such as a constant elevation of the world 's average of temperature , leading to a dangerous shrinking of ice in the mountains , or unknown climatic catastrophes such as hurricanes .
[non-native] also , it may be much more exciting , pure , and romantic to see new places without the filter of the group experience and opinion , and the pre-determined judgements a travel guide may confront you with .

[non-native] also people registering in each community is increasing day by day .
[non-native] third opinion about understand the ideas is when understand whats the meaning of the stuff then its more easy than just remember it , because the question or a sentence will always be changing whatever or anytime , if we learn facts in algebra you will remember for your all life , if its english , then you will remember at first second or first two day , but after the days then you will forget , then your study life will be always in remember and forget .

[non-native] if people can not know their past and they live in domocratic country .
[non-native] so he doesn'thave that much time to engage himself for helping his community .
[native] but communism , philosophically , is basically a `` perfect '' society .
[native] i do not object to eu free movement , but we must appreciate that the vast majority of eu immigration to the uk is low-skill .
[native] i mean i 'm pretty sure they 'd be charging the same rate for all services for all customers ... so how does it stop hot spots charging what they like ?
[native] for the record , i wrote one of my masters theses on negotiations during doha ( particularly with respect to agriculture ) and did a 30 ects course on international negotiation which may better explain my interest in the subject .
[non-native] however , advertisers do try to make consumers think that what they will get is what they need .
[non-native] it is another form of strength which benefits from gaining great wisdom and a more decisive approach to the lifestyle they would deem as successful .
[non-native] in our century there are more available interdiciplinary areas namely the preliminaries are ready but further relations should be determined .
[non-native] if you just do the same things before which are done because of taking for you guarantee you can be stay in a situation being a research asistan years and years .
[non-native] for example the wright brothers knew a lot about flying .
[native] westminster could use the occasional reminder about that point , too .
[native] hmm , i seemed to have pushed some buttons with you , that 's why you 're bringing up northern ireland and the ira , saying that they were engaged in child 's play , because you think that little jab is going to push my buttons too , well it 's not , sorry nice try , i 'm not emotional invested in the ira .
[native] > i imagine the main reason they want us to stay is because of the massive net contributions we make to brussels each year .
[native] fyi my net vote score on this reddit is ** -60 ** if a / skeptic * is getting up-voted here and you 're getting down-voted , ( not one of which was mine ) it might be your fault .
[native] also , i think new england that just straight up copied a shit load of englands city names .
[non-native] for that reason , i support that those people who innovate could be closer to successed than those who do not .
[non-native] when we try to remember something whether difficult or simple , finally we hope that it will be the long memerise .
[native] i was trolling the troll and pointing out that the uk is far from a bastion of democracy .
[native] the reform that the uk wants to see is n't a shared by the most of the other member states .
[native] i 'm just claiming my own credentials on the topic , because the point i 'm arguing is n't whether eurosceptics are right or wrong on another topic .
[native] home : opensuse 12.2 / windows 7 for games work : ubuntu 14.04
[non-native] and the main reason to support this idea is just because the world 's population is growing very fast .
[native] laptop : arch linux media centre : ubuntu phone : android
[non-native] also , another way of getting facts is by finding out what happened , example who killed someone or who is the one responsible for commiting a crime .
[non-native] therefore , i respect of him because he is intelligent .
[non-native] he took the risk of dropping out of school and establishing his own company that produce software and finally achieved success .
[native] of course , you 're ignorant enough to conflate `` not wanting to violate human rights by massacring and deporting all refugees and asylum seekers '' with `` open border and free immigration , ` including africa ' ( lol really you fucking racist ) '' .
[native] snowden may have done good to the * nation * , but certainly not to the * state * .
[native] i remember being asked if i was there as an aid worker .
[native] not bad now however , so far as i know .
[non-native] furthermore , older cars can be the main problem about traffic .
[non-native] but yet , some changes can be seen around the world : new types of cars are being created .
[native] > or perhaps it is the appeal to authority .
[native] > and it 's working according to the polls ( purple ) and the eu elections .
[non-native] even in advertisements for hoovers , the dust seems to be just put down there , and goes with one use of the hoover .
[non-native] the long and the short of it is that it is more important for students to learn facts than understanding ideas and concepts .most people have to try or choose something they do not know what happen after .
[native] i was really excited at first and then disappointed because i had already heard about this :(
[native] if my country was in this situation , i sure as hell would want a referendum instead of the arbitrary choice of a leader elected during very unstable , uncertain times .
[non-native] in the other hand , people with creativity is a benefit for the world because they always come with new project and they can handle the future easily .
[non-native] for instance , i can remember an advertisement for a washing powder which pretended to make your clothes ` whiter than whiter ' .
[native] it 's not like a child is free to call themselves whatever they 'd like and are able to legally change it by deedpoll .
[non-native] sometimes we have heard the negative aspects of cars .
[native] the eu exists because ( old ) europe was internally unstable .
[native] i expect all of putin 's interviews to be given in supermarkets with so much food that it spills into the aisles and he is stepping on it .
[non-native] hence the person who doesnt perform anything in his life has to fall down ` for instance foreign languages i have been learnin italian for 2 years , at first it was a new idea for me and i took a risk because of the limited speaking region of italian but i spend many times to learn it and for the present i am working in italian company , i am not sure that if i am succesful person but exactly it effected my carrier .
[non-native] facts build the basis on which you can set up walls , in this case , ideas an concepts .
[non-native] in this field you may become richer by following new ways of money investment , but if they fail , you would experience what really the word `` risk '' means .
[native] hungarians and portuguese culture likely have little in common , other than their shared christian faith .
[non-native] cars will use other forms of energy such as vegetable oils and why not water .
[native] when faced with the single biggest failure of your ideology - the collapse of the ussr - then there 's bound to be backlash .
[native] it 's not like it would have been impossible for justice to be done simply because the public could n't see her face .
[non-native] also , if they have a little time , youngers do other things like going to the theaters or other places and playing on line game rather than sharing work for their communities .
[native] so just about everyone that is n't jewish or arabian does n't understand ... ?
[native] if you want to be more like them then that 's great .
[native] quoting a few tweets is not fact checking nor is it proving your point .
[native] there is an inevitable outcome to this if crossing into austria becomes more difficult for people traffickers .
[native] presumably in this case the couple are guilty of marriage simulation .
[native] right now the major eurozone powers do n't want poland in the eu because they have enough on their plate .
[non-native] in the school in the work eveybody struggle for doing his or her best .
[non-native] this has made cars easily accessible to the middle class family also .
[native] edit : oh well ... more cadbury 's for me .
[native] the law will still practiced , and if she is found guilty , the sentence will be the same whether she is wearing the veil or not wearing the veil .
[native] ( btw just stereotyping , i do drink coffee occasionally and it 's normally the proper stuff , but the one true hot drink is tea . )
[non-native] if i could get most of the information tour guides provide by reading travel guide or searching on internet , i do not think it worth to pay that much money for a tour guide .
[non-native] a person can always move forward , but i believe with something in his hand on which he can fall back on .
[native] is that the sound of air going between your years ?
[native] isds is used for things such as when foreign corporations are unfairly legislated against , or when a country expropriates a corporations assets .
[native] paleobalkan people certainly different than we are true sons of trajan romania only real latins fuck turul
[native] if legislation is rejected by the council or parliament , they submit changes back to the commission .
[native] the problem for you is that they are european in istanbul , and will remain so for the foreseeable future .
[non-native] in conclusion , facts have some more advantages for the study than ideas and concepts that i have shown the above .
[non-native] for instance , if there is a company who needs money and support to develop themselves , to trade with another companies in order to improve their skills in their own sector , they may show their own products much better than they really are .
[native] 1 . admit he failed/promised to much 2 . claim the eu is being unreasonable and campaign to leave .
[non-native] for example i have n't done bungee-jumping before or have n't visited japan .
[native] do n't bring your facts into / u/ljaubrey 's white-knighting .
[non-native] in japan , there are diverse colors and it 's very difficult to make these color , thus i want to get it with japanese color .
[non-native] there are not many genius in this world and if you are not one of them you shoul be satisfied when you know very much about one subject .
[native] how often does a revolution not end in a complete clusterfuck ?
[native] but those things could be in place without all the negatives ... as for the stability and internal consistency , you could clearly see lack of both at the start of the ukraine crisis .
[non-native] finally , on an economic scale , because of the wars , the tensions in the countries that belong to the organization of petroleum exporting countries ( opec ) , the prices of oil have increased up to more than 70 dollars per barrel .
[non-native] to summerize understanding ideas is important for remember and using ideas .i agree with this statement , because the main point of a student perspective is to get the principals how things works , so that the student is able to understand the ideas behind the concept , and can explanation why .
[non-native] and know that they could be if never disapoint .
[native] it is one of the most democratic muslim majority countries in the world ( although the current protests are making people doubt that ) .
[non-native] there are six basic questions to everything - when ?
[non-native] i do not see any future perspective of an alternative vehicle but who knows what will happen in twenty years .
[non-native] many succesful people take risks in order to do what they want .
[native] but the frightening point is that it is preferable to hold bonds at negative interest rates rather than holding a balance in a bank 's account .
[non-native] so that shows what important is the teaching of facts .
[non-native] on the other hands , if we would join a group , we will have to be led a tour guide , so we could not spend a great time .
[non-native] success does not only come from a studies oriented field which is clear from the examples stated above .
[non-native] i 'm sure that one of the most important guideline to follow in life is that if you want to make money and be successful , first of all you have to spent a lot of it !
[non-native] when talking about this topic another pretty important thing has to be mentioned .
[non-native] they provide the tset time to use their products .
[native] i mean that whilst they are hard workers , if something does n't go right they just say `` oh well , we we can try again '' rather than being angry .
[non-native] they didnot have time to sit back and enjoy their accomplishments .
[non-native] an it will really help them to get the subject in a right an better manner .in my view it is not true that young people do n't dedicate enough of their spare time to helping in their communities .
[non-native] so no matter what age you are you can enjoy life .
[non-native] generally , the capital of a product may be quite cheap .
[native] [ it seems that the italian courts apply the eu concept .
[native] `` so this is how liberty dies ... with thunderous applause . ''
[non-native] i want to find hotels , restaurants and so on also .
[non-native] when people want to go to another place , they use their comfortable car to get there .
[non-native] for these reasons i belive that young people is more enjoy their life .
[native] yes , they should have lost because the canadian government only did it for political purposes .
[non-native] in the short run , people can be successful by clinging to what they know how to do well if they are doing something which others can not copy easily .
[native] the funny thing is , i have had a few english friends move to ireland and look for work as benefits here are better , your guys get paid very little competitively .
[non-native] this time , known as `` cip hours '' , is an important element in the assessment of a student .
[native] the i ^ ^ ^ ca n't ^ ^ ^ see u
[native] but in my opinion , adoption would be the better option .
[native] > finally - expecting every separation process to be on good terms is naive .
[native] but i 'll just as often here how threatened we are by the us and china .
[non-native] so i decided that i make these `` social nine month '' .
[non-native] nowadays , we have got the technology which can be used to manufacture cars at a cheaper cost and which can be maintained with no extra care .
[non-native] this in fact is a very good explanation of how the competion and rivalry in the car industry develops everyday .
[non-native] so , broad knowledge of many academic subjects may help you solve those problems .
[native] it would n't have been seen as a sign of sovereignty to pay the full charge , it would be seen as cameron too afraid to stand up to the eu .
[native] if there 's a ryanair or easyjet flight from a rich area to a poor area , that 's the type you get .
[native] luckily i didnt live in bramladesh just worked there for a few years .
[native] i very much doubt the blame for rotherham lies on the shoulders of / r/europe subscribers .
[native] the only insane hypothetical here is to invade tunis to dump mediterranean migrants there , i was just responding to that .
[native] > just because there is an association between being uncovered and indecency does n't mean that uncovering your face in court is indecent .
[native] `` we may only be 70th in the whos international health care rankings ... but dang do we have a nice new palace . ''
[native] i see your point but he was specifically talking about people dismissing the article out of hand , and that was an example .
[non-native] once i went to see my friend working in this company , the coffee offer was broken down by accident .
[non-native] for example for the young people enjoyment could be doing mountain climbing or playing basket ball but because of age they are not able to do all these activities .
[non-native] plus , as population increases and as they gets more affluent , they want nicer cars .
[non-native] they can have an overall view about their culture .
[native] > madrid is not a city-region : i think you know what i mean by that !
[non-native] in my opinion enjoying life is having a happy and contented life with nothing to worry about .
[native] i 'm surprised northern ireland has a life expectancy slightly lower than the rest of the country .
[native] the earliest records we have are herodatus saying that the area was people by an agrarian thracian tribe ( not native to anatolia ) , followed by the establishment of byzantium by athenian greeks .
[native] this is a very cheap way to hold down speculative price buying , so i do n't think they will give up the commitment any time soon .
[native] sure we export to other nations but compared to our exports to the usa it is nothing .
[native] in my city i 've forgotten things at the park and at stores before , and the shopkeeper usually puts them aside or they 'll still be where i left them .
[non-native] as for me , i prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide .
[native] cameron did the best thing he could for his party in the situation .
[non-native] they can also have much food if they want because of their parents .
[non-native] depending on personal experience and emotinal concern , we may find that some people will agree the statement , on the other hand , some people will choose the opposite decision .
[native] winning wars `` easily '' is good for the economy .
[non-native] only ff a person confine to a specialzed field and narrow down the point of focus , innovative research is possible .
[native] also are the cdc as moderate and progressive as they claim ?
[non-native] this happens mainly because throughout his academics he has to write many exams on these subjects so his preparation would also be for the exam only rather than gaining knowledge in that particular subject .
[non-native] thouthands od them about a particluar products that it is hard to choose from .
[non-native] a good example for such a person is bill gates .
[native] > necessity of a unfied economic policy lets be honest that will realistically never happen .
[native] there will be women who are forced to stay at home at all times , purely because their fucked up husbands refuse to allow any other man to see their face .
[native] yes you did have a crisis when it came to switching over to the metric system .
[native] / u/christ0ph , you claim to always harp on about the evils of ftas and the ttip in / r/europe because your posts get deleted in other subs .
[non-native] for instance , if a student just know the definition of something , he would think it is unchangable .
[native] where should i look for cheaper capitals with better weather ?
[non-native] in the first one , there is something to be done and it has to be the use of the adverised product .
[native] i 'm not sure if you realise just how much the sheer scale of immigration has changed though , immigrants have been coming for hundreds of years , but since around 2005 it has almost been 70 % of our population growth .
[native] that 's their prerogative , but mine is to go somewhere that feels more like home .
[non-native] if you want to have help from all these different faculty and really create wonder like cochlear implant you must have general to specific approach in studies .what is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject ?
[native] i quite like him , and he 's right about juncker .
[non-native] i asked my friend , ` why do n't you repair it , it is so important in the daily life . '
[native] the only reason they 've managed to stay there is because of germany 's staunch refusal to consider fiscal transfers to help bolster southern industries & economies while being adamant about the implementation of austerity , thus basically keeping the south on their knees & killing any hope of a sustainable recovery .
[native] it does make some remblance of sense really , belarusian and ukrainian people being ethnically and linguistically the closest ( although belarusian language was severely russified during ussr ) .
[native] > ... the equality nazis trying to give christianity a jolly good kicking ... wow , i did n't know there was no proceedure for a civil marriage in the uk .
[non-native] a successful person is able to risk anything he possesses to achieve his project , he would obtain an unforgettable success .i agree to the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do and support the following belief of mine with the following views .
[non-native] so i strongly feel that advertisements enhances the product than what really it is .did you read about `` 7 habits of high success people '' wtitten by steven covey .
[native] this song about tube strikes in london may cheer you up a little http://youtu.be/0dftdplaylu
[non-native] by using another words , older people are surrounded by the things which they had already experienced .
[non-native] thus , these high costs will soon oblige the people to consider alternatives , because they ca n't afford the amount of money that is necessary .
[non-native] i have attended a german `` gymnasium '' until year 10 , where we were not able to make any choices whatsoever .
[non-native] in a group tour , it is almost impossible to change the plan .
[native] > poland : 5 kings that 's really weird for a republic .
[native] they could not be clearer that they want a brexit .
[non-native] beacuse the facts can be clearly and deeply unserstand that what is the real thing .
[non-native] firstly , a person is exposed to different kind of subjects in the elementary school to help him understand his interests .
[non-native] for instance , although my teacher is a professor , he is still study lots of thing because he think that he can think more widely if he know lots of thing about the other subjects , so he can easily find the solution if they are related with his problem , as a result , broad knowledge of many academic subjects make us to see the solution more easily .
[native] i would say that italy and spain are rather larger concerns .
[native] but he did make a very compelling argument for the similarity of the concepts .
[native] there is a concept of [ parliamentary sovereignty ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/parliamentary_sovereignty ) .
[non-native] in the end i would like to conclude by saying that advertisements are basically made to market a product but it totally depends on the the wish of the consumer whether to buy one or not .
[non-native] also on another aspect older people have enough time to meditate and do prayers .
[non-native] on the other hand , if the buget is limited , i would like to share some costs with others , then i will choose a group to join .nowadays many people look for ways in order to decrease the number of cars in use .
[non-native] finally one damn advantage by having a personal car is we can reach our destiny in time instead of wasting time in wating .
[non-native] still it leaves the point that not many old persons are observerd in discos , rock concerts or in the movies .
[native] it concerns a group of pilgrims travelling to canterbury cathedral .
[non-native] many people might feel that due to the increasing awareness about the negetive effect of cars on air pollution and the rising oil prices , the number of cars may decrease in the coming years .
[native] given germany 's better economy , more people will move to germany from france .
[native] there are no restrictions on where you can apply for asylum , the whole ` first safe country ' is a guiding principle , not an ironclad rule .
[non-native] secondly , risks are beautiful because a static work is not as nice as a very active work with a lot of risks and changes .
[native] their husbands are forcing them to , and may beat/kill them if they leave .
[non-native] very often you realize the disadvantages of the products after the act of purchasing and you are disappointed that you can not use the product in the way you planned it .
[non-native] furthermore , to sale product and make then look bettter than they realy are , you do not have be unthrusful .
[native] remember that the sun and the daily mail are two of the best selling newspapers .
[non-native] on the other hand , most companies show thier products over thire thinking by using advertisements .
[non-native] in my opinion , if on one hand people knowing the main issues of many major topics can be useful , on the other hand we still need very qualified people in very specific fields .
[native] this has happened with radio dj 's and other employees who hav been fired and claim such .
[native] if you do n't have anything more substantive to say , we 're not going to get anywhere .
[non-native] it is good behavior , and also it is for all people , not only for one or two .
[non-native] consider ibm 's system / 360 family of computes introduced in 1964 .
[non-native] i think it important to specialize in one specific subject .
[non-native] for this simple reason only the demand for cars and their usage is bound to increase .
[native] wheelbarrows are pretty efficient actually , they do n't require petrol and have low co2 output so exempt from carbon tax .
[native] now a ) what a major fucking hypocrite b ) let 's not accelerate our pension crisis by cutting off immigration which would result in an aging and reducing population .
[non-native] you would be required to stop at ceratin times since people in the group will have needs such as food or refreshments and you would not be able to decide when you want to do the things whenever you want to do them .
[non-native] furthermore social engagement is not considered very `` cool '' by most young people .
[native] they have to make it look like it was worth something .
[non-native] many customers become manipulated in the way how a product is presented .
[non-native] but in that felid implemening principles of electronics may lead some new discovery , which in any case wouls be impossible if person has knowleadge in onw area only .
[native] it looks like a level from * hitman : turkish delight .
[non-native] sellers also may need to provide the information that customers often misunderstand about the product .
[native] ] ( http://www.kyivpost.com/multimedia/video-2/ukraine-today-russian-speaking-ukrainians-reject-russia-survey-shows-odesa-and-kharkiv-oblasts-oppose-insurgency-video-365784.html ) this does n't say much about donetsk and lugansk , of course .
[native] secondly , if the easiest way for them to leave syria is to get on a ship bound for italy , as opposed to crossing hundreds of km of contested warzone , why would n't they ?
[native] so , 75 % burns - > 25 % survival
[non-native] for example ; the most famous artist in turkey , who is kemal sunal , always used car becuse he is always afraid of air plane .
[non-native] the second reason , that one should n't try new things and take risks , is the comprehension of the primitive knowledge ; that is to say , people may try to learn the theories or methods that have been already accepted by the authorities .
[native] even if the brics solidify into a major power ( instead of a hypothetical boogyman ) , russia 's going to be a junior partner .
[non-native] advertisements are always made fansy and appealling for pulling attention of the general public making them aware about the presence of particular product in d market .
[native] we 're just vocal about bullshit we do n't like , which every country should be .
[native] people get news on the internet or at a newsagent and at each of these there are euphile options available .
[native] wait 3 months for the election that was agreed upon by all parties instead of running him out of office and pissing in russias face .
[native] the difference between european culture and american culture in this regard is that most europeans think of any other european country as an equal and so the jokes and making fun for us , does n't have the possibility of have a sinister tone about it .
[non-native] the tour guide plan includes the fee of staying , trabelling , food and so on .
[non-native] but if the young people dont know what you aere talking about they will not join in the counverstation .
[native] i 've been thinking about emigrating from australia to germany .
[native] well you said violating first , then you said picking and choosing .
[non-native] this saying well describe the relation between the quantity and the quality of the subjects .
[native] because certain major members economic policies are protectionist and anti-growth ...
[non-native] therefore , you get up everyday while traveling with a clear mind and do not have to think about what you are going to do today .
[non-native] second , unlike the system of the untied sates , we here in korea do n't have any specified rules or encouragement to make youth participate in the work of community .
[native] to suggest that all of this violence is post 9/11 and post western intervention just is n't true - i do n't dispute it has been more prominent , and more frequent , but there has been islamist violence throughout the 20th century .
[native] you love foreigners there , but you have restrictions on the amount that can work there !
[non-native] most teenagers are rather self-absorbed and forget about the community around them .
[non-native] he was surprised by seeing the apple that had fallen on his head and he thought that why does the apple does not go up towards the sky and why is it falling downwards .
[native] smoking in bars has been banned in new zealand and it 's great !
[native] who has reason to have this happening right now .
[non-native] it start at 9 o'clock and finish at 5 o'clock at japanese companies .
[non-native] students can get more ex [ eriences while they are understanding the ideas .
[non-native] many try to show their product as the best product .
[non-native] if they had n't been existed , we probably would n't have had what we have right now so , i think that a good example might be leonardo davinci .
[non-native] considering these points , i can not say that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
[native] i 'd also like to see that as the end of our participation in nato and for all american bases in the region to be dismantled .
[native] why would n't it if china , russia and india were legitimately becoming a threat to us supremacy ?
[non-native] in my opinion , a good educational sytem is not only a system where students just learn facts .
[native] i mean you can buy the reusable ones which use a mesh filter and you put your own coffee in , is that still posh ?
[native] because it is a sham marriage to dodge immigration rules ?
[native] whats worth more , the propaganda or the morality of the situation .
[native] this is irrelevant because sham marriage legislation is entirely unrelated to xenophobia .
[native] there 's a lot of people who vote in line with the statu quo .
[non-native] it is possible to explain my position with my following considerations .
[native] their economies are way too intertwined and will just be another switzerland/norway .
[non-native] i tink increasing of number of cars would cause some dangerours proplems like devert type of pollutuion ; there is pollution of soinds and gaz and also that can incerse the number of road accidents when it will be more uses of carsi always believe that one of the biggest trait for a successful person would definetly be his ability to try out new things rather than persisting doing things he knew best .
[native] this sounds like a teenage forum poster said this , not a fucking adult human being .
[native] it must pass a qualified majority , and may be proposed if it has more than 65 % support .
[native] i ca n't find a copy of it online , unfortunately , but here 's the gist from what i remember : 1 .
[native] it was a majority christian country until only a few decades ago .
[non-native] look at the dave matthews band , `` america 's greatest band '' , as the rolling stone magazine judged .
[non-native] for example , if people watch a soap opera in which an artist tastes a new drink , they are going to taste this product as much as possible .
[non-native] because of these reasons , traveling in a group led by a tour guide is a better way to travel .sucecesful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
[native] > it actually has to go through all national parliaments and the us congress , so elected officials would have to vote on it as well .
[non-native] as the world is to fast people have to compeite with the world .
[non-native] probably he was considered mad too , but if he had n't written the `` divina commedia '' , we would n't have spoken how we are doing today .
[native] here 's what the government of canada says about it : > about the listing process > [ the anti-terrorism act ] ( http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/a-11.7/index.html ) provides measures for the government of canada to create a list of entities that : > * have knowingly carried out , attempted to carry out , participated in or facilitated a terrorist activity > * knowingly acted on behalf of , at the direction of or in association with an entity that has knowingly carried out , attempted to carry out , participated in or facilitated a terrorist activity > how it works : > the legislation provides for the governor in council to establish by regulation a list on which , on the recommendation of the minister of public safety , any entity may be placed .
[non-native] once the prices are down how can we stop people from buying cars which would be their best bet in terms of money and in terms of reducing pollution .
[native] here 's a satirical `` petition '' from economic history that makes the same point i 'm making .
[native] if this represents taxes paid by the employee on a dollar earned , it is n't a cost to the employer at all .
[native] obviously since i have health insurance i paid like $ 15 total for the experience in the us , but the total bill before insurance was over $ 280 .
[non-native] the tour guide named hitomi was so humoras and beautiful lady .
[non-native] until then , ibm had been selling two inherently incompatible classes of computers meaning that it have to give different training for each type of computer and also that parts and accessories were not compatible .
[non-native] plastic come from crude oil , which means that plastic is another reason why we deplete oil .
[non-native] moreover if we wish to have broader knowledge in many acdemic subjects it will be difficult for us to concentrate in each and every aspect of every subject .
[non-native] to me this statement is just like throwing accusasions on others .
[non-native] finally , it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts , because the task of education is the development of general skills .
[native] this was a ridiculous exercise in showing off , nothing more .
[non-native] a successful person is a person who wants to be different from other people ; he / she wants to have some characteristics that can make him/her special in front of all other normal people .
[non-native] we are living in a world which is highly industrialized .
[native] this means that there is actually a low chance of direct conflict , as it played out throughout the cold war .
[non-native] the essectial reason can by seen by everyone is that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is the requirement of our morden scoial and the work you have .
[native] `` it holds that the legislative body has absolute sovereignty , and is supreme over all other government institutions , including executive or judicial bodies . ''
[native] but if you 're living in a country of 300 million + , potentially living thousands of miles from the nearest ocean and unlikely to ever visit another country or even meet a foreigner why would you concern yourself with how your speech is interpreted by outsiders ?
[non-native] the advertisements , especially those which people have interested in , are made in an attempt to get attention of as many people as possible .
[non-native] in the recent society that has a large number of goods and survices , people tend to be boared to keep seeing same products .
[non-native] so it is much easier to sell products with low quality if you adress children with the right advertisement .
[non-native] you can get cheated the mayority of the times and that 's abussive from the people that sell the product and know what they are showing is not even half of what you are getting .
[native] there 's no point talking about grocery shopping if you do n't take into account salaries .
[native] in resulting struggle he has his head hit on table .
[native] and you realise that the canadian health department cleared it after extensive tests and said that even those that were working in close proximity with the additives , elderly , sick , and children , faced no danger from having the substance in petrol ?
[non-native] finally , judging by the way technology is making advancements we can assume that twenty years later we may have the ability of transporting a person from one place to other by personal flying objects or transporting him through a virtual domain in no time .
[non-native] an individual who has specialized in one specific subject is respected by society and his peers and looked up to by his juniors and subordinates who aspire to be like him .
[non-native] we need cars in order to live in this morden life for many reasons .
[native] i 've envisioned `` green datacentres '' in ireland due to our perfect location between the us and europe but where we have good wind power there is no fiber and vice versa .
[native] we 've paid our time with the uk thinking they are the big players and get to call the shots in our world , you took em , now you keep em .
[native] further , considering how easy it currently is to get a visa , and then perminant residancy , the benefits seem small and the risks seem large .
[native] i would n't be surprised in the least that some finds its way overseas .
[native] it would be neat to have some images from some distance away of the probe 's meeting with the object .
[native] i actually care about palestine too , but i can see through the intentions of those who are so passionate for them .
[native] i 'm sure everyone would be happy if there was more constructive arguments in the formative stages of legislation ( or the eu in general ) .
[native] or look at the london olympics , which was also in some respects a relentless marketing exercise by the uk ...
[non-native] so depending on the study it would be better oin way or the other one the thing is to choose the right one .i disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
[native] at first i thought the communist police might have abucted all these missing people .
[native] ok , do i have to take your word for it or is there some proof i can look at ?
[native] you must understand , though , that your position represents a tiny minority of opinion across the world as a whole and your position therefore seems to be that almost everyone in the world is xenophobic .
[non-native] there are different types of it , such trasnprtation on land , sea and air .
[non-native] people may argue my point with the fact that fuels i.e. petrol and diesel are rapidly depleting and with depleting fuel reserves it would be difficult for cars to survive for next tewnty years and thus reducing the number of cars .
[native] if we 're talking about the whole island , things get just a slight bit more complicated .
[non-native] that shows me that on the one hand religion is not dead ( insted it comes back ! )
[native] but still negligible compared to the number of migrants attempting to reach europe .
[non-native] if the number of cars increas i would be very warried and i think we will have a lot of problems for our wealth .
[native] so north west europe is full of hedonist workaholics ?
[non-native] honestly , i do not think that teenagers are going to reject their only source of independence .
[native] but for now , we have made a faustian bargain with private sector-driven credit booms .
[non-native] in conclusion , i think there are many young people trying to help with them ideas to help the communities and maybe just few are not helping , so , i advice every one to help their communities and work hard in every thing they try to attend in it .the manufacturers are using advertisements to mark their products .
[native] or what some of the independence movements/regions are actually called .
[native] > i think cameron is playing a bit to the tune of tabloids which is unfortunate .
[native] a lot of people do n't like bilingual comments , but i do , because i 'm learning portuguese .
[non-native] success will happen just in a frame of time .
[native] germany is getting policies to her advantage by draining the industrial lifeblood of her neighboring countries and refusing to help them when they 're on their knees .
[non-native] in the similar way an environmentalist could give proper suggestions on air , water and marine pollutions more effectively than a person having a broad knowledge in this field .
[non-native] today , mass media has a great power on human being .
[non-native] this is an important issue to consider because advertisement is part of our daily life .
[native] for example , the uk economy was badly hurt after winning ww2 .
[native] from what i have read about the un charters on the right to self-determination , no government law or constitution can prevent people from determining their rights to self-determination .
[native] wikipedia ( which cites the oecd ) has the 2011 median german household income at [ $ 28,000 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/median_household_income ) which would be around $ 22,100 .
[non-native] but if success is defined as doing what is right , doing one 's duty , being honest and so on , then changes are not so important .
[native] who is the guy in the huge picture on the right side ?
[native] i ca n't tell whether he is actually earnest or just a contrarian for the sake of it .
[native] but regardless , the example used in the article ( a company suing because egypt raised its minimum wage ) is egregiously misrepresenting what happened .
[native] this is within a `` reasonable period of time '' which tends to be at least two years for major purchases but can go up to five or six depending on the thing .
[non-native] the reasons i would like to mention is tecnology is growing day by day people expect changes in all their fields
[native] apples and oranges , are we going to discuss this story here or history
[native] i 'm a brit who publicly scorns instant coffee .
[non-native] in fact it is possible that in future , not too far , there will be more efficace , more beautiful and user vehicles than cars .i have mixed feelings about the statement `` mostly advertisements make products seem much better than they really are '' .
[non-native] to conclude thats exactly where i want to come back why i agree to both statements .
[non-native] besause they know that try new thing and take risks is a rule to succe .
[native] there 's more than one kind of `` far left '' , you know .
[non-native] i believe that other than displaying the properties of products on television or radio , advertisements work more and more on consumer 's needs and motivations .
[non-native] because he feels that he might not be able to do these things in advanced age , older age might be boring in all respects .
[native] it 's far easier for britain ( or europe more generally ) to attract hard-working and well-educated people from countries in worse economic and political situations than from the ` good ' countries you 've listed , so if you 're only interested in bringing the most useful people , you 're doing it wrong .
[native] for the record , '' wuyfufyyyfffyyfbbydyyyyuddyyyyd '' is welsh .
[native] to scare away people who are getting married just to get a green card ?
[non-native] traveling without a tour guide may be a challenging for me .
[native] do n't want to narrow it down too much .
[native] i ca n't access that link from here in nz .
[native] do n't you think that when some eastern ukrainians who are on the fence and do n't know whether to be pro-ukraine or pro-russia see such a neo-nazi brigade fighting for ukraine that that would motivate them to become pro-russian ?
[non-native] especially for people who want to know about the country .since i lack of experiences in young people participation in other countries , let me focus the topic geographically .
[native] if that does n't count as a ` race ' nothing does and it 's impossible to be `` racist '' .
[native] thousands of random surnames popped up ; some people have surname of `` toilet '' .
[non-native] but we need to take risk to spend some times and money to discover some new formulas and save the world .
[non-native] the car company try to produce more useful and high ability cars .
[non-native] although i really liked those people who traveled with me , by the time we arrived at the airport , everyone had had their own lives to go on .
[native] i would suggest that we stop polluting this thread .
[native] well if you manage to find someone amongst these danish guys who actually did that , then you have my blessing to lock them in maximum security prison for the rest of their life .
[native] i agree , but i ca n't help but feel sorry for a girl who has worn a burqa in public her entire adult life , and then is suddenly forced to remove it to an audience .
[non-native] those who support this point hold the opinion that young people virtually have much more pattern to have fun .
[native] wyoming has 1 member in the house of representatives and california has 53 members in the house of representatives .
[native] you 're more likely to see a woman working there .
[native] how in the name of gods green earth is the audience being victimised by witnessing a veiled woman ?
[non-native] furthermore , the same thing happens with old people , who can not live longer on their own .
[native] ` overly passionate american thinks everyone else shares their obsession ' .
[native] i would say the same thing about the irish .
[native] however , theists clearly do n't agree that god is * a priori * ridiculous just like a teapot in orbit is .
[non-native] people 's ability can be better after bitter experiences .
[native] he was doing fine with the street protesters for months until he signed that deal with france germany poland , but he was strill constrained by some stuff because his face was still in charge .
[native] i guess socialist states was the wrong word , but there is more government intervention in the economy than in countries like germany or the usa .
[native] you can only be president in russia 2-3 terms in a row , so when putin ca n't be president , medvedev gets to .
[non-native] if the task to be fulfilled is formed and determined in detail by others , the person could not use his own inciative to achieve the project .
[non-native] may be the new things they don not like , but they believe nothing is impossible in the world .
[native] and again , even here , it 's questionable that the government 's actions were lawful .
[non-native] in additon , more parkings are available for cars as lot of places to park have been removed .
[non-native] in conclusion , i have shown the reasons to disagree with the statement .we are living in a consumption world .
[native] i agree with you that greece is probably the closest culture to turkish culture , but there are still noticeable differences .
[non-native] this show your bosses that you are commited and have a great loyality .
[native] his name is plamen and he set himself on fire ... [ nominative determinism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nominative_determinism ) much ?
[non-native] but in my opion , i would prefer that learn facts is more important than just learn ideas and concepts .
[non-native] admittedly graham bell is a succesful person because he tried new thing and took risk
[native] even if new england has to leave the u.s. to join .
[non-native] if he has a car it is useful to him at any part of the day .
[non-native] the last but not least , a more personal reason is why there will be fewer cars in use than there are now is we could have more safe transpotation than cars in twenty years .
[non-native] so , firms advertising their goods better than it really is have not any demerit .
[non-native] automobiles cause a lot of pollution but recent adavancements in technology have provided new technologies that decrease pollution to a large extent .
[native] also up until 1982 all constitutional amendments were dependent on the united kingdom 's parliament if we ever wanted to make any amendments to our constitution .
[non-native] we can not create and idea or concept without learning them .
[non-native] so this is the time they will see some money in their hand .

[non-native] the main caracter , an old man , looks past his life : the different books he read , the different women he slept with . .
[native] however having a veiled woman stand in the dock will not cause any loss of dignity to the curious onlookers , court officials , or the judge .
[native] so you can get shot down for simply being in international airspace these days can you ?
[non-native] the courage to try new things eventually brought tremendous success to him .
[non-native] they have so many reasons and examples to say this .
[non-native] for example , if you want to be artist , you can goanywhere you want , like italy or new york .
[native] while i 'm sure those things have an effect ( or those that are really happening ) the fact is it would still be poor regardless .
[non-native] once people get a job , a wife , an husband , a situation , they forget that they are free , that they can live like they want even if it is not easy .

[native] > when france did n't want to go to iraq they were vilified in the us > every time the us wants to go into a country to bring 'em some democracy they want it to be an alliance - they want to spread the responsibility > sure the us needs europe as a customer , but they also want europe as an ally to stand together against future economic and military challenges to their spheres of influence from bric countries oh do n't get me wrong : i 'm not saying we can stand alone politically .
[non-native] it is possible to change your career but i feel its a shame to waste all these years of studying and start from the beginningsuccess in the life
[non-native] in many cases the parents do not spend any thoughts about quality and price because they want to make their children happy and accepted in the community of other children .
[native] > the criminal and/or security intelligence reports are submitted to the minister of public safety for consideration .
[native] because under a society of ** patriarchy ** the men are * expected * to do this as they are the `` bread winners '' or are expected simply to work earlier than women are .

[non-native] by growing up they will develop their sense of observing things and therefore , trully appreciate the meaning of the life they are living .
[non-native] i think that without any qualities so as to stay undisturbed or the ability to forsee what will have some success , we ca n't have any success .
[native] switzerland is closing the borders , which is the `` one '' i mentioned there .
[non-native] so with all this changing that there is in the dayly life of everybody , young or not , it is difficult to improve this sector of the world .
[non-native] however , it is important that specialiyed people do also have a little knownledge of other subjects too .
[native] shitty though it is , this is because russia is infinitely more powerful than either portugal or lithuania .
[non-native] a lot of people want to stay where they are because they believe they are satisfied with what they have and are doing right now .
[native] it 's for the people of catalonia to decide .
[non-native] therefore , some people think that we have to re-organize the educational system .
[native] if they act similarly to the parti quebecois then they will only serve as a frustration vote when the other parties fail in their obligations , however their support will collapse with relative ease whenever the other parties promise or make some kind of show of change .
[native] you 're most probably mentally ill and you 're just not worth my time .
[native] if anyone 's being whipped up into a nationalist frenzy it 's the people on here who are promoting ` well leave our club then ! ' .
[native] as a society we can only assume that they will be fair , unbiased and impartial .
[native] it has dropped to 11 cents over the summer and nothing has really changed in canada , so it must be the americans .
[non-native] the words and the tonation must be appropriate to the product that is getting advertised .
[native] enemy armies eventually , with much loss of life , capture one israeli town after another , but the loss of their brothers in arms has sufficiently infuriated the enemies that they massacre the inhabitants who remain in the town .
[non-native] thats what lies with the young people of our society than the older people .
[non-native] however , consumers never think about where these money come from and go .
[non-native] the one that has to deal with only one specific subject for all of his professional life is likely to become frustrated for not being able to do something else for an instance .
[native] also the locals are unbelievably friendly and we got free drinks and entry to all clubs for the sole reason of been irish .
[non-native] i have just known two or three persons who have done that in their life .
[non-native] therefore people would like to switch to faster travel options such as cars to spend time spent in travel .

[native] leeds is the student capital of the uk as it is served by three universities , and has over 120,000 students studying here both full and part time .
[native] well what i 've looked into it there is n't an actual exam , you just need to do the process all in hungarian and have a small conversation with someone at the office in hungarian .
[non-native] such product was a knife supposed to cut any kind of meat and , believe me or not , the advertisement was really convincing , showing a guy who was cutting any kind of beef .

[native] in saying that i would not have my children undergo what i consider a pretty unnecessary surgury .
[native] no borders were violated but yet it 's russia 's fault for existing there
[native] and since may the parliamentary arithmetic has meant that the two biggest groups -- the epp and the centre-left party of european socialists -- must now work together in a mushy , grand-coalition way to get things done .
[native] > when were the nazis and soviets ever allies ?

[non-native] there is no one in the world who doesnt want to be successful .
[native] personally i blame the vikings for killing boru after the battle of clontarf was won .
[native] > on a personal note , a lot of what you 'll read in the media is pretty fear and ignorance driven hype about how evil it is , but from everything i 've been able to determine so far , everything seems pretty vanilla .

[native] all new democratic constitutions emulated theirs , which created a much more inclusive and successful form of nationalism .
[non-native] can you imagine if he would have stopped creating and inventing computer softwares after the really first versions which made him gain a lot of money anyway .
[native] the idea that china ( or really anyone else ) is going to side with russia over the west is a little silly , seeing how deeply tied the chinese economy is to the american one .
[non-native] this provides them with a solid base when the use of the previos knowledge is requied .
[native] in china : they are expected to revalue their currency and stop lending to their state owned companies at low interest rates ( forgetting , ofcourse , that many western countries subsidize labour and agriculture ) .

[native] it looks like a law of the conservation of credit booms .
[native] besides being a condescending prick to someone who disagrees with you .
[native] best line : > its these liberals , they never listen to what you have to say .
[non-native] in this sence students can broaden their minds and views .
[non-native] when i have a list of all the stuff of writing such as canon , imitation and inversion .
[non-native] the comon knowledge represents all ideas , concepts and theories we need to make the right decision and understand our environement .

[non-native] mark benz the creator of the first car , everybody thought he was crazy when he invented the carriage with no horses .

[native] if you do n't , then you ca n't say that the government 's solution is discrimination .
[native] but i also think it 's prudent to have some nuclear in the mix , given it 's emissions free .
[non-native] another factor that led to my decision is that when a person travels with only a couple of people whom he knows or alone , he has the chance to choose the route that he is going to take and he can stop at various places for quick visits such as cafes or places on the way .
[non-native] also the t.v can give your country agood backgroung around the world .

[native] jesus fucking christ does it rock my boat when straights explain to me how we 're living in gay fucking utopia .
[non-native] furthermore , your thoughts may be turned to death .
[non-native] some of the reasons , first if a student can understand and idea he will be able to apply what he just notice ( learned ) in another way or situation , like when a `` painting student '' just learned that the colors could be mixed to form some others new colors , and the profesor explained so well which types of tones can be mixed with others , and he will experiment all what he understand of this class .

[non-native] the main reason people forget one if they learn another .
[native] yup , even though the us says mean things about china , and china secretly hates the us .
[non-native] my opinion is , i think the youngs who participate helping their community and contributing to its development are people who see that in their community something is missing and the think , they feel , they can do something in order to improve some life conditions .
[non-native] while we choose the car we drive , the parfume we use , even the apartement we live in we are affected by the advertisements .
[non-native] therefore i conclude that some advertisements make products look much better than they are .

[native] it is the massive market that we can sell things to .
[non-native] in my opinion the experience to do something important and to see people laughing again , is really important for the eduction of today 's youth .

[native] but that 's hardly the same as the [ agenda setting ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agenda-setting_theory ) going on by / u/christ0ph .

[non-native] step by step this person will work and do everything to be more successful and to show the word that he / she is a grand person .
[non-native] the concept is the first thing that we should learn , because it is what we keep in mind after a lesson .

[native] by the time of the troop surge & sunni awakening , when we managed to really get full control of the situation again under patreus , the damage to our image had already been done & we would never get that extra time back to fully stabilize the situation before we left .
[non-native] my choices follow the way of a broad knowledge , excepted the last year : i prefer to specialize myself in only one subject during one year .
[non-native] studying many academic subjects is n't alot , you have 12 years of studying in school that is more than enough .
[non-native] manufacture of the car has been considered as a very lucrative business that many coporates are spending enormous amount of money on developing , manufaturing and launching the state-of-the-are cars equipped with new features .
[native] i 'm tired of such statements without any proofs .
[non-native] that means , i can easily get closed to other people .

[native] > if by that you mean a deal where the uk gets an exemption from free movement while still being in the single market than i think that is less than unlikely , it 's basically an political impossibility .
[native] the truth is that kind of `` eurosceptic '' party loves the eu because it allows them to do that , distracting from all their other failings .
[non-native] since the united states have a very advanced economy and the other countries are going into that direction , i presume that even the developing countries will face that economic evolution step .
[non-native] in addition , while they have free time after the hard work in their study .
[non-native] in conclusion , according to me , travelling alone or with only a couple of friends who share the same interests with me , without a tour guide would be my preferred way of travelling because it would give me the opportunity to choose my own route , i would not have to stick with the time regulations of the group and i would visit the places i want to visit , whenever i want to visit them instead of that of the group .learning is based on too main tecniques , understanding the ideas and concepts and learning facts .
[native] when not directly participating ; by not doing one iota to punish or persuade their overloads ( us ) to change its stance on the world .

[non-native] this has been an silly experience for me because i always did it like that .
[native] but tactical nukes are n't designed to destroy cities - i 'm not talking about the scary world-destroying strategic nukes ; tac nukes are designed to instantly destroy a military base or an army group on the move .

[native] & nbsp ; it 's really horrible that people could swear allegiance to such a fucked-up former country .

[non-native] and he decided to spend his all money untill his death .
[non-native] as to close again to the subject some people are describing their tasks around scientific happenings and they have an hard job to deal since it is the most difficult part of the life to discover something .
[native] it is funny that the slogan goes away , his voice changes and then the slogan comes back and his voice changes back .
[non-native] therefore , most of the time advertisement companies are exaggerating the features or the quality of the products in order to be liked by the product owners and be hired again in the next time .
[native] i 'm not sure if anyone else has heard of them .
[non-native] when a person looks at the advertisement , he/she sees the product as better than it actually is , and is therefore persuated into buying the product .
[native] i always thought that the balkans were a huge hot spot for tourists .
[non-native] moreover , opposite example can be found to demonstrate that students understrand the ideas and concepts may not know how to use them into the real life , such as the learn the theory on the class and do not know how to use it into the real experience , so there is no meaning to learn it as students do not use it .
[non-native] the urge to try new things might also come from peer influences .
[non-native] thus young people find more time to enjoy their life than older people .
[native] a fianna fail , youth defense and household tax advocate was teaching a class on charles haughey , known capitalist .
[native] quebec uses a french-style civil code , whereas every other canadian jurisdiction uses common law .
[non-native] if someone always tells you anything what you want , you will not know how difficult to get the knowledge .
[native] every few decades , a new round of oppression .

[native] since moving to munich nearly 6 years ago , visualising [ one litre ] ( http://www.asklubo.com/uploads/attachments/published/12/11696/de/mas-bier-die-einheit-der-menge.jpg ) has become much more intuitive .

[non-native] for istance it is not important , to me , remembering dates and hours of every single battles as long as you can remeber how the war went , why it broke out , who were fiting and why .
[non-native] i would like to support my view with the following reasoning .
[native] vietnam ( traditionally antagonistic toward china ) does n't have to worry about china invading , for example .
[non-native] we , as human , need to go forward by deeping in our vast background knowledge to determine for example the cause of cancer and a way to prevent or cure it .
[non-native] many advertisements use famous people like sports figures , movie stars , singers , or young and attractive people to draw people 's attention .
[non-native] in conclusion , i think that young people will enjoy life more than older people do .
[non-native] for example , i travelled to a great historical place in egypt and the tour guide was very helpful to explain every tiny detail of the temples .
[non-native] for example , you do not need to sit in the middle of the problem in order to solve it .
[non-native] as a result , these children tend to behave individually and do not think about others who need help .
[non-native] i think that in the world we are living in , it is more and more becoming essential to specialise in a subject so that you have market for your skills in the job market .
[native] now , here is michael bloomberg , the now former mayor of new york city , attempting to read prepared speeches in spanish : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9kmgramba0 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdt-4yrt6yc http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4elqmkj1pm at least he 's making an effort though : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg1syw6o4ak
[non-native] step backwards , get a huge view of the problem from different angles and , now , try to face it .
[non-native] for example it is important for a researcher or scientist to have a deep knowledge of the subject that he is studying because he is producing futher knowledge in this very specific topic .
[native] fuck , i 'm sorry that happened to you .
[native] none of the other members seem to be a special snowflake .

[native] legislation must pass the latter two by a qualified majority and may be proposed through the commission , 65 % support from parliament or a citizens initiative .
[native] / r/europe , / r/mapporn , / r/paradoxplaza , and / r/polandball are the same sub i did leave polandball though as it was getting bad for various reasons
[non-native] as a reaction on these changes the idea of specialization has developped .
[native] even after all that , they are not allowed to propose legislation , but must take whatever they 're given by the unelected commission .
[native] as an eu citizen born and living in new zealand but wanting to settle in europe eventually , this all makes for good reading :d . new zealand : pros : nice scenery , generally nice weather ( summers not too hot , winters not too cold , decent amount of sunshine ) , laid-back people , high standard of living , mostly safe ( although there are areas which are pretty bad as far as safety goes ) , people are generally pretty friendly , economic situation is n't too bad compared to most western countries ( although we have many moving to australia each year ) , religion does n't interfere in daily life and politics .
[non-native] third , i think it might be quite a boost for your self-confidence to be able to see yourself as a real expert on a given topic .
[native] like i needed another reason to like the dutch .
[non-native] his achievment started from a new idea : to produce a personal computer .

[non-native] so we can wonder if in twenty years ther will be fewer cars in use that there are today .
[native] some linguists think korean and japanese are related , but there is n't much solid evidence , and lots of linguists also think they are not related .
[native] here 's the canadian [ chart ] ( http://www.parl.gc.ca/about/senate/today/images/02-2.jpg ) ( in french cause i 'm assuming you 're french .
[non-native] if we forget about volunteering and think of helping one 's community as just spending time with that community and taking part in its activities , one will still find that young people are rather absent .
[non-native] finally , advertisements are made to make a product look better .
[native] if there had been , they would have been fine , but their reports explicitly stated that there was no danger from the additive .
[non-native] other example could be a famous people like an actor who win an oscar .
[native] they truly believe what they say , and i 've met quite a few of them in person as reasonably close friends - they do n't need payment at all .
[non-native] however , he succeeded it , and now , he is one of the most successful business men in the world .
[non-native] students also should n't have to depend upon the teacher or say ` yes ' to their ` yes ' , if the teacher is saying a fact student should n't agree until he gets some idea of understanding , after understanding it only he should agree for the fact .
[native] britain , france , germany , russia , italy , swedenmarknavia and possibly spain just about covers the average persons geographic knowlege .
[native] some essentials need to be subsidized , like water and agriculture .
[native] i had it in germany ( i 'm english ) , asking why i was working there , were n't there any jobs in england etc ?
[non-native] if i would not have tried riding motor bike i would have ende up by simply learning cycling .
[non-native] as a consequence of that the person who will buy the product is going to think about some irrelevant stuff such as the fabulous life of the famous person .
[native] i went for 4 day 's to visit a friend on erasmus and had a great time .
[native] you just do n't like the idea that the people of istanbul are part of europe and therefore european because they do n't fit you racial , ethnic , or religious ideals of what constitutes `` european '' .
[native] well i ca n't speak for australia but yeah the uk and ireland do have a rising obesity problem .
[native] george galloway has a big web-army and sadly people just like to circlejerk over his youtube clips and opinions rather than challenge them .
[native] it 's just a level of transparency that i 'm used to and makes following what 's going on so much easier .
[native] oh no , someone said something bad about my religion , muh feelings .
[non-native] thus not only warren buffet , fidel castro and robin williams did that they changed the way people look at the usual and maybe mundane workings of earning profits , driving a nation and being an accomplished actor .
[native] to the same extent , support from monetary funds ( esm and imf ) is not necessarily unlimited and untouchable either .
[native] the canadian constitution refers to british and foreign countries as two separate categories .
[non-native] first of all , it is more enjoyable for a tourist to discover the country he/she is visiting by him/her self .
[native] during this period , thousands of mexican nationals were also entering illegally by land through the united states .
[native] if they do n't have an evidence backed reason for it , then they 're essentially pandering to populist sentiment .
[non-native] we can see other sides of the society too .
[native] features some great acting , especially from the lead actor and very talented richard roxburgh ( you 'd be surprised in how much he was in that you did n't know about ) , and features many internationally renowned australian guest stars , such as sam neill ( jurassic park ) , geoffrey rush ( the kings speech ) , and hugo weaving ( matrix , lord of the rings ) .
[native] has n't german real wages fallen in the past few years ?
[non-native] here this is called social engagement and i think the different forms of engagement are also under the young part of the society still not dead .
[non-native] in other words , in such busy and competitive world , we can not close ourselves in just single subject or specific knowledge .
[native] we are starting repayments to the uk before the end of the year .
[non-native] furthermore , life does not go the same way .
[non-native] in conclusion , it is possible to confirm that some products seem much better that what they actually are thanks to the possibilities that advertisement provides .
[native] it was a joke in reply to a joke .
[non-native] thus , in my opinion and in my experience , i think that it is not that true that young people do not give enough time to helping their own communities .
[native] europe is so diverted historically and it does not make sense to hold any grief over the past .
[non-native] there are some sloshen for that like but some like a little thening in the car to less the poloson in our air .

[non-native] in this place there is an economic boom that in my opinion will increase a lot the car 's production .
[non-native] consequently , there always is a risk in realizing them .
[non-native] as a consequence , taking the above-mentioned reasons into account , we can safely draw a conclusion that there will be fewer cars in usu than there are today .
[non-native] we can see and hear it everywhere , not only by the normal medium which the television or the radio .
[non-native] as we know each comany has its own plan to attract the customer .
[native] at the risk of sounding pedantic , us + australia is still larger than the eea , if i 've defined it correctly as eu + norway , iceland and liechtenstein .
[non-native] after this experience , i never believe what advertisements say .
[non-native] a `` good '' product will be created from a `` good '' advertisments .
[native] i think europe serves its best interests by being independent from both russia and the us .
[non-native] if a parson who wants to have success in life only does what he/she already know maybe he never became real leader in his own business .
[non-native] so you could improve the knowledges and skills of the country .
[native] nope , that 's the ` bad ' one .
[native] that was a pretty long winded way of saying `` germany should push for a fiscal and debt union '' .
[non-native] since going with a group of people , you might feel very innoying , usually , if it is led by a tour guide , the time is very limited , you go to the place and then you need to go to another place as soon as possible .
[non-native] above the reasons , the best option of way of studing subject is having broade knowledge of various academic subjects .nowadays , people start to begin frightened about the fact that pehaps in the next century , there won t be enought oil or petrol and so that it will be impossible to use cars anymore .
[non-native] but having intersent in one subject you cant detract youself to another subject if you get bored in the present subject .
[native] > but not every tom dick and harry who happen to live in a messed up country and their cousins neighbour got killed because some militia got the wrong house .
[native] as you know , aircraft carriers are not the whole of a country 's military .
[non-native] i do not agree with the statement because he following reasons >
[native] and i 'm not aiming that rhetoric at every briton just the stark raving kind who believe that the eu is some demonic organisation bent on subvention of the british will .
[non-native] the main disadvantage of trying to have broad knowledge on many academic subjects is we will be realy diificult to choose our profession that is if you concentarte only on mathematics you can known as an mathematician .
[non-native] in the past medical doctors were able to overlook broad fields of medicine , giving them the chance to help patients with many different diseases at a good level of care .
[non-native] first , most of people are not familiar with the places where they are going to travel .
[non-native] in this fast paced world , it is very important for a person to specialize in any subject which he feels to be interesting .
[non-native] if i want to survive from the harsh competition of the current society , i need to devote to a certain field of research or business , and be a specialist who has unique information or skill .in the near future there would be an increase in the usage of cars because the prices of the cars are going down rapidly .
[non-native] during the car 's running they producing a lot of useless gas which can pollute our air .
[native] the phillipines has call-centres serving english-speaking countries , and it is an official language , and a former us colony , and this http://www.economist.com/blogs/johnson/2013/04/business-english pakistan seems to have fallen into a void , somewhere between asia and the middle east , although to most people in england `` pakistani '' and `` asian '' are synonyms .
[non-native] you need the knowledge from physics : the microscope to see the internal sturcture of cell ; you also need the knowledge from chemistry to understand the underlying mechanism of the cell 's operation ; besides , to know how biology science can be better benift human being , you need the knowledge from medicine , ethnics , and even bussiness , considering that you want to sell you biological medicine to customer , you even need the knowledge of international politics as big biology project such as human gene research requires the coorperation amone nations .
[native] i kept looking for dr crane banging his gavel to send the man to death by exile .
[non-native] however , marie curie died because of intoxication caused by the big amount of x rays that she absorbed .
[non-native] so do the advertisments reflect the reality of the product ?
[native] a national strategy to lower every day costs to citizens .
[non-native] actually , we do not think that we are helping people , we think that we learn a lot from them .
[native] it 's a load of wank the papers put out to keep the clicks and purchases high and it fuels a fear and paranoia and rage against an unjust system and then points it in the wrong direction .
[native] and i think many people here can tell you that all through out eastern european the exact opposite of democratic proliferation happened , in fact 50 + years of tyranny occurred .
[native] i live in a part of the country where there are loads of poles , romanians , balts etc and practically the first thing anyone says about them is how hard they work - no one objects to these people but there are also a substantial number who have no intention of supporting themselves .
[native] wow no offence but this made me a little pissed off at luxeumbourg > :( though to be fair , there was probably more to it - they probs pissed off someone high up ?
[non-native] when we look it from an individual point of view , the economic growth of the country is growing at a faster rate .
[non-native] when we were kids , our parents a lot of time toll us what things we should n't do , and we can have clearly the concept and the idea - like we should n't touch the fire because is hot - but when you really learn this things is when you learn to fact , like when you feel the fire or when you see a house on fire .
[non-native] on the other hand , having just one subject at their hands can really help them to spend plenty of time for preparing and building the basics of thier favourite subject .
[non-native] since he is free to choose subject of intrest he will persue with zeal and eager .
[native] the thing is with these types , is that they mistake contributory factors with it being the main factor .
[non-native] therefore , this is a good experience of relaxing yourself and acquiring a sense of accomplishment .
[non-native] finally , i would like to repeat that i strongly suggest travelling in a group led by a tour guide .i disagree that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
[native] that 's an international issue , not a dispute within our own country .
[non-native] people will take up the business which is already established and famous through this there is no problem for them .
[native] saudi arabia wants to stop the development of fracking and other oil and gas extraction methods .
[native] personally , i identify much more with the gaelic countries than with england - the english are just a tad too bit uptight , reserved and boring for me , does n't mean i do n't love them though ( or the 1.2 million australians that were born in the uk ) .
[non-native] i believe young people enjoy life more than old people .
[native] ( in the same way as recent economic difficulty has reanimated racists and bigots in europe , for example . )
[non-native] in conclusion , i would like to say that groups and guides are an incredible combination for every trip .
[non-native] some of them does not care about thier communitiy at all .
[native] second , my position on monsanto is pretty different to what it was a year ago - because i educated myself , and learned to read in depth beyond shallow , simplistic , conspiratorial and fearmongering stories .
[native] i 'm sure the same is happening in spain , portugal and greece .
[non-native] however , when the good was very different from the commercial , we waste the time and money after buying it .
[non-native] in my example this means that this one different jump might just have been the one your teacher wanted to see .
[native] well how much are they going to devalue it by ?
[native] pretty much all successful isds cases are when the government takes political decisions which disproportionately disfavour foreign companies .
[native] i lived with italian engineers in london who all looked for work but ended up taking jobs at places like starbucks and caffe nero .
[native] that 's equivalent to a few years of inflation happening at once , a bit of a shock but nothing too dramatic .
[non-native] having knowledge in one particluar subject makes you to concentrate more on that particular subject and it makes you more interesting on other hand .
[native] the uk is behind you ( well , i am anyway ) .
[non-native] the turth isthe issue at hand is '' do advertisements make products seem much better than what they really are ?
[non-native] i just want to enjoy and relax on my vacation effectively .the issue whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than specialize in one specific subject is a controversial one .
[native] you accused me of being a troll ... are you being intellectually honest here ?
[non-native] and all of this aspects are often seen in the area of a job .
[native] napoleonic wars , greek war of independence , belgian revolution , november uprising ( poland ) , carlist wars ( spain ) , crimean war , austro-prussian war , franco-prussian war , russo-turkish war , yup relatively stable .
[native] there 's also the northern bank robbery in 2004 which the pira were involved in .
[native] i did n't notice that , i 'll have a look .
[native] i was certain you 'd been shadow banned , or deleted your account , or something .
[native] they also think that it gives them that same right anywhere .
[non-native] there may be the case that there ways of enjoyment is different as compared to young people because of the constraints such as age or physical disability which comes with age .
[native] you fundamentally do not understand what an * existential threat * means .
[native] he probably went back to russia with tens upon tens of billions of dollars , and started looking for people to hire immediately .
[non-native] secondly , non-governmental organisations which are cheifly controlled by young students are established to allow the young people to raise there voice on community related issues .
[non-native] in this turning point , young people enjoy life more than old peolpe do because young people intend to do a varity of sports , experience less pressure from the society , and obtain the tendency to try something new .
[native] you treat culture as if it is something set in stone , something stable , as opposed to merely a collection of people 's interpretations of rapidly shifting and changing beliefs about a nebulously defined group of people , hence why you think it is something that can be deconstructed with logic and made to fit however you want .
[native] maybe one day we 'll figure out how to live together on this planet .
[non-native] however , when you think that many people can learn the things which are already known .
[native] and perhaps if you did your research , you 'd know about cifs ( the blanket guarantee i was talking about ) which basically guaranteed all debt for a two year period , or the elg scheme which was only put in place after cifs was .
[native] the end result , like everything else in the eu , will be a political compromise .
[non-native] however , it may even happen that he is so disappointed that he will not buy at all and at the same time he will make a bad advertisement both on the item and on the company .
[non-native] i do n't think this problem will be solved in twnety years and i do n't think there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
[native] well , it is probably because some chinese person is translating it in real time , clearly because he/she knows chinese .
[non-native] it is because compared to the community work , the young people have many other things are more important to them to accomplish , such as studying and making money .
[non-native] that makes the fact that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
[native] when i visited barcelona one day was about 35c .
[non-native] learning the facts is not the answer all the time .
[native] this is so multifaceted and involving issues below the surface that its pointless to ascribe blame to only one party .
[non-native] many of them are kids , and they came japan because their parents came japan to find thier job .
[non-native] my major is art history so i need a other subject .
[non-native] tour guides are often more experienced and more familiar with the place of travel and they can show us the speciality about that place .
[non-native] firstly , facts are of course useless if it have not a concept or idea within ( newton and the apple falling is a ridiculous fact if newton wasnt explained all with his newtonian mechanics theory , when we see that exists a force field called gravity ) .
[native] would you then say its okay to be racist towards them because the stigma comes from important reasons ?
[non-native] and thus he can help the community by keeping it clean .
[native] this doubled the territory under the control of beirut , at the expense of what would become the state of syria .
[native] does not give consent for transnational governance , political integration , the euro , unelected executives , etc the crucial difference between westminster and brussels/strasbourg parliaments is one of legitimacy .
[non-native] may be this is the result of past generations ' behaves to us .
[non-native] this information is very usefull for marine engineers which is got by a fact .
[non-native] first of all , young people have more power than old people .
[non-native] when i was young our family did n't have a car and it was n't strange thing at all .
[non-native] i disagree with the issue that there will be fewer number of cars in the next twenty years because improvement of technology , foray of various kinds of fuel on which the cars can run , and the economic conditions of the countries , the life style of people - these are the various factors which contribute to more usage of the cars in the next twenty years and near future .i first tend to agree with this statement and i actually hope there will be less cars in the world , because pollution is a serious problem .
[non-native] since the gas price is high in recent years , people tend to buy the cars that consumes less gasoline .
[non-native] when i heard that story , i so suprised .
[native] there is more to a country than merely its economic worth and , yet , you actually touch on this yourself : > you might want to leave the uk , but in their hundreds of thousands people from the rest of the eu are moving to the uk .
[non-native] this young generation does not hinder any issues they have taken up and it shows their dedication and commitment in their work .
[native] my gut feeling is that it 's time for greece to just take a haircut and be done with this whole shenanigans , it 's dragged on long enough .
[native] he 's talking about ireland here our government bends over to the americans and a lot of the american population is pro israeli no ?
[native] > thanks for making it clear you 're an idiot , additionally to not being capable of reading comprehension .
[non-native] if we do more there can have more warm into .
[non-native] often they are left alone , nobody of there familie comes to visit them so they are happy to have someone to talk with .
[native] i 'm sure google would jump at the chance to be a front runner in adding the functionality to draw accounts , prompting the others to do so as well .
[non-native] bigger choice and you can work in different departement .
[non-native] the third reason is that advertisements give you sometimes the feeling that you unconditionally need the product which the advertisement is for - even if you have never thought of this product before and you do not really need it .
[non-native] in my personal opi that is more probable a solution could be cars that does not destroy the natural ambient it will not happen and it would bo too expensive .
[native] i 'm not your neighbour ( canada ) but there are a lot of you guys here .
[non-native] there will be more and more cars and this will have a terrible impact on our environment which already damaged by the pollution that cars produce .
[non-native] number of cars in country sides more increased than before .
[native] alternatively , it 's because i 've studied the topic extensively , and i 've argued about it on reddit before such as [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1c736z/in_unusual_move_german_chancellor_has_invited_uk/c9drnm6 ) and [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/145bi4/norway_to_raise_import_tolls_on_dairy_and_meat/c7a6bkj ) .
[non-native] so the car of the futur wo n't , probably , look like or even run like the ones we have now , it might be a plane , a car and a boat at the same time , but it will never disappear .
[non-native] if at all he is having many subjects at a time he may not find sufficient time to leran more about his interested subject .
[non-native] secondly , there is no point in fake advertising .
[native] prior to the financial crisis , unit labour costs in ireland increased massively compared to germany , though since then ireland has had what economists call an internal devaluation , bringing it much closer to germany .
[native] do n't kid yourself - the uk will not leave and will not be allowed to leave , either through applications of carrots or sticks .
[non-native] people with dreams , people with risks , people with posibilities to grow .
[native] i agree with one of the comments in article , why not use that money to build cheaper , efficient housing ? .
[native] you 'll never know what your country does best until you 've been away from it .
[native] the reason we rely on health department reports and the like is because they determine how much exposure of a substance the weakest people can tolerate before it becomes dangerous .
[native] only insofar as all western romance languages are just dialects of each other - catalan is very distinct as far as they go
[native] the fact that some europeans misrepresent it to fit their own needs does n't alter the way the flag is perceived in the land where it 's actually relevant .
[native] that 's ... a lot of people going to cyprus .
[non-native] now a days , too many cars are running in the raod , in the city , every where .
[non-native] some people may even choose to cycle instead of driving .
[non-native] one must be well-rounded , at least knowledgeable in general , to get to success , which is not an easy case at all .
[non-native] i think every one should risk and try to improve himslef .
[non-native] mistakes are usually acceptable from yonger people more than from the old .
[non-native] it is also easier to find a job since companies are looking out for peole with specializations .
[non-native] after they undestand ideas and then when have a discussion class to diversify the ideas , they may start to think about it more carefully and desirably .
[non-native] in addition , company 's bad products prove that advertisement is not better than it really is .
[non-native] sometimes in working life it is really important to have a subject you are really good at and not several ones you are less good at .
[non-native] he gained recognition and funds started to pour in , helping him expand his work from his neighborhood to the nation and finally to the entire globe .
[non-native] first of all , imagine a child , it always smile and play games or laugh .
[non-native] cars will eventually fail to these other superior devices , and give way to some other wonderful transports .
[non-native] the importance of the product is not important anymore .
[non-native] in order to have this product sale you most develop a good strategy , and follow some rules .
[non-native] they think that they always succesful at this way , and they never try to learn other specific thinhgs .
[native] bizzare , it seems much more fair than fttp to me .
[native] i promise you , if you make a post with quotes to back up your arguments ( and page references ) , i will read it and give it my full consideration , you might even shift my opinion .
[non-native] the most important reason is that iit is necessary that advertisements have to present their produces better .
[native] so now you can no longer , at least here in / r/europe [ 1 ] , pretend that these ugly facts are `` conspiracy theories '' and that your assertions deserve trust and little in the way of actual scrutiny for whether they are true or not ( they arent , as shown by the fact that its now been admitted that the ttip .
[native] try the ` italian club ' trattoria on bold street .
[non-native] an young if decide to go out , go out more late and back more late .
[native] then the rest of the british can do what they want .
[non-native] in conclusion , i think young people is more enjoquite often management gurus thrust an age old aphorism , `` it 's better to be a jack of all trades , than a master of one '' .
[non-native] its often belived that going to sale place and seeing the items befor buying , renting or using is good , therefore the person can checke and find out if any damage is there .
[non-native] and a reject with all that can suggest us that we are getting old each minutes we go throught .
[native] how did we not unite over this hundreds of years ago ?
[native] and it 's almost inevitable we 'll respond in kind .
[native] of course , the simpler approach , which would create something like a federation , if not true federalism , is to continue as is , and simply use rules of construction to ensure central legislation does n't accidentally infringe on the jurisdictions of devolved governments .
[non-native] secondly , i do think that old people 's experiences in life does back them up in enjoying their life ti its fullest in the sense that it allows them to have a good knowledge of how life can be lived and enjoyed more than young people .
[native] now , my personal assessment is that it 'll be one of two things ; 1 .
[native] > for me , i just fucking love seeing political theatre .
[native] absolutely fascinating if true , ca n't wait to see the news reports tomorrow !
[native] if russia invades belarus , or the baltic 's then we will get involved but before then ukraine may only have our economic support .
[non-native] therefore , high oil price results in fall of demanding cars , and these kind of trends becomes general , the number of cars are decreasing .
[native] * oh my god dude , you 're just as bad as the anchorman
[native] have traveled back and forth ever since for holiday .
[native] you also gave us some of the best phones in the world .
[native] again , when you make an argument , you have to link to a source and provide a page reference , like i do .
[non-native] what if thomas edison has not invented the first light bulb ?
[native] proper democratic process should allow for protests , and that 's essentially what this is just at the highest level .
[native] that 's presumably why he finished what he wrote with a question mark .
[native] `` france moved the lebanon-syrian border to the anti-lebanon mountains , east of the beqaa valley , territory which had historically belonged to the province of damascus for hundreds of years , and was far more attached to damascus than beirut by culture and influence .
[non-native] because there are so many things in the world to know about , and you dont have time to understand there concepts , and only option is to learn it .
[native] no , i 'm making fun of you for having nothing between your ears .
[non-native] this is tha only way to have success in life .i agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
[native] and if you want to put it into * those * terms , i 'm proud of what we have achieved so far , and i absolutely * will * look at some other countries and think to myself `` thank god i 'm not a [ racial minority ] / [ gay person ] / [ insert difference here ] living there '' .
[non-native] for example 2 adn 2 is 4 it is a well known fact and very clear for every one but an idea of a someone else may not be clear for every one .
[non-native] i finally got frustrated and decided to return it .
[non-native] and if i would like to choose any of the field after my b.tech i must have atleast some idea about the other subjects .
[non-native] in a group tour , each person needs to follow the group 's plan even though the plan does not care of what he or she wants .
[native] whilst i deplore their acts , i do n't think they 're exactly treasonous .
[native] i think those are the two main ones that people are worried about .
[native] yep , very common in central , southern and eastern europe .
[non-native] you will not be able to get more or less that can give you many chalenges in your life .
[non-native] the problem of this is that people should try to be concerned about the advantages or disadvantages of using the car or another transport .
[native] norway 's is over three times higher , with around 19 % of eu farm income coming from support compared to norway 's [ 61 % ] ( http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/agriculture-and-food/producer-support-estimates-subsidies-2013-1_pse-table-2013-1-en ) .
[native] [ britain ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-11053375 ) , of course .
[native] dae the x box one ( which were definitely all forced to buy ) is literally 1984 ?
[non-native] it involves the student to learn the ideas and concepts behind the subject apart from learning the facts .
[non-native] moreover new marketsing strategies and governments policies will lead to a decline in the car prices in such countries which will make them more affordable than it was in the past .
[non-native] to conclude , i wish to reiterate that enjoyment and happiness are a state of mind and matter of personal choice rather than absolute entities .
[native] two things europe is severely lacking in comparison to america .
[non-native] say besides providing other common facilities that a car , which is made for common people provides , if the averages of the cars are increased many times from the current value and if the life time efficiency of cars are incresed more , one can surely say a huge increase in the use of cars .
[native] wow `` i refuse to watch the stuff you posted cause the one i seen one time had nothing to do with the topic we are discussing '' thats pretty much a wrap , clean it up boys we 're going home
[non-native] for example , there is a advertisement about a vacume cleaner , in the advertisement , you are told that it is powerful , easy to handle , and you are even showed that how clean the room is after it is used , however , after you buy it at home , after you actually try it , you may find that it is too big to handle , and it takes a large space to store .
[native] any spanish/catalonians care to eleborate on who artur mas is ( does he seem liberal ? ) .
[non-native] what people do not like happens , they quarrel .
[native] > she 'll often borrow an raf aircraft that gave me an image of the queen jumping the fence at an raf base and taking a typhoon for a joyride
[non-native] he will suffer for simple reason that the person who is trying the new thing that he already know how to do well in that thing .
[non-native] for example i 'm a good students , i have good marks and a good theoric knolendge , but if i want to have success in the future this is n't enough .
[non-native] the only solid argument that i can find to defend the reduction in the number of cars is that due to the lack of gas and consequently the increase in its cost , people will buy less cars .
[native] those are the ones who would benefit from possible canadian oil and gas shipments .
[non-native] i think that one major mistake that we usually commit is to measure success with creativity .
[non-native] these old couple use this money in such things which as per me is enjoying life like taking a round the world ticket and go round the world and see the beautiful nad exotic locations around the world or buy a convertible or buy a vacation home in the suburbs of a city to relax and have a peaceful time away form the hustel bustle of city life .
[non-native] but those great persons were living in another time .
[non-native] let is consider , for instance , the case of young volounteers .
[native] if americans have really turned into that which you 're representing . . than not only will i return to germany , but i 'll start agreeing with europeans when they talk smack about americans instead of defending the us ( and ` americans ' ) at every turn - as i have this whole time .
[non-native] but this method is taking its toll on us .
[non-native] but this does not strongly supports specialist because it is the general physician who also hold vital position in giving initial treatment and direct or recommend physician only in case it crosses it 's limit .
[non-native] in case of elderly persons , their ways of enjoyment are diffrent they like to read novels , magzines or some religious literature .
[native] just because you want civil rights and to be who you are and define yourself , it does n't mean you do n't want to be part of the family .
[native] indeed : i thought beirut was the paris of the east .
[non-native] cheldren like their school , they waste most of theis day time studying and having fun at school .
[native] however those children will get one of the best educations on the planet , have universal healthcare coverage and will live in a country full of opportunity .
[non-native] and it is right , in a certain way .
[native] > it also means the eu gets proportionally smaller .
[non-native] while in the past , it was a reserved mean , which was prerogative of the richest part of the population , nowadays it is used by almost the 85 % of the world population the question is : but will it remain a successful mean among twenty years or will be replaced ?
[native] would be nice to start a life in europe .
[native] problem is , estonia is in eu and nato .
[native] maybe he fails at the finish line when we call , but for now he 's making everyone react .
[native] greece needs devaluation while germany needs appreciation and because of the union neither can get it ) .
[non-native] some people may think that driving thier cars is more convenient than taking other transportation .
[non-native] so students have to understand the ideas and the concepts which helps them in future when they want to research anything or they want to develop any product which is already existing .
[non-native] therefore , they all have spend a great amount of money on advertising so they can compete with each other and survive .
[non-native] so finally if he gets fruitful result of what he had done to achieve that thing his enjoymrnt will be at its peak .
[non-native] there were people from all walks of life and different generations on the ship .
[native] tldr : the us would help but it would be too costly for the entirety of the planet .
[native] the people in guantanamo are ( allegedly ) terrorists .
[non-native] i think trying new things and take risks is highly releated with being a successful person and this approach effects positively the way of being a successful person .
[non-native] in conclusion , if you want to succeed , you have to consider your fail and risk .
[non-native] third , i want to look many places by myself .
[native] the professor lost his tenure and was fired the next day .
[non-native] youngsters now a days do not help their communities much .
[non-native] so this means that ideas and concepts will always help in many ways like when the pilot is in trouble so then you would atleast know that how to land the flight as if you know the concepts of it how to land the flight down on the runway .
[non-native] thirdly , car is the cheapest transportation in many countries .
[native] they have the best public transport in the country ( they have the dart and the luas ; other cities are stuck with only city buses ) ; the best hospitals , the best schools ( they have a lot of schools that are n't as good as some in other cities , but i digress ) , get good media coverage and the best utility services .
[non-native] therefore students should have to learn precise dates and events in order to illustrate by concreat examples their ideas .
[native] it 's an extremely complex , and often contrary system .
[non-native] they have to go to junior or high schools and also have to go to the preparatory schools in order to get in a competitive universities .
[native] i find it genuinely surprising just how many people on this sub are anti free trade .
[native] the first country to suffer decent sized chunks of it being turned into radioactive wastelands is going to be ukraine , the first people to suffer atomic incineration & the slow death of radiation poisoning is going to be ukrainians , and they might be the only ones if de-escalation happens afterwards * ( we are talking about nuclear warfare here guys , so it 's not just individual countries at risk , it 's the entire world ) * , making any potential war not that beneficial for anybody involved .
[native] much of it will be taken up in corruption , illegal logging will continue .
[native] newsflash -- the global recession and eu crisis are pretty much one in the same .
[native] liverpool seems to have a good italian community , just like our scottish counterpart , glasgow
[native] the spread of economic liberalism has benefited us in the short term , then sheer economic size overwhelms us .
[non-native] go out with friends and join some partys for example .
[non-native] first reason why i agree with the statement is that these advertisement companies should act in this way to be able to make profit which is the rule of capitalism world .
[native] i have an italian barber here in canada , and he 's amazing .
[non-native] so , you do not need to buy maps and lookup for direction .
[non-native] this problems was occered by people 's tools such as cars .
[non-native] but , in fact , you ca n't just drink the diet beverage and become the hot model .
[native] they have to apply for citizenship , it 's not something that 's automatically granted , and there are prerequisites .
[native] because obviously most jews ascribe to the beliefs of rabbi ovadia yosef who also said in 2000 and 2009 that the holocaust was the result of jews sinning ... do you think most israeli jews believe that also since they in your view believe in the quote you put forth ?
[native] yeah there is no real border between the two countries , it 's as easy to cross the border as it is to go from england to wales .
[non-native] for example , a younger person working has support his family finacially and should be responsible towards everyone in the family .
[non-native] most of family in this country has one or two children , and they can not have a chance to experience of cooperation .
[native] either way can you not be nationalistic in ireland without people assuming you have a '' fuk da queen '' mentality ?
[native] fending off the spanish , various explorers , and being the last port of call for the mayflower before america .
[non-native] you 're looking for a job , but you could also apply for a job that which
[native] i just read the council update on the financial transaction tax .
[native] again , a very arbitrary designator of whether someone is european or not , subject to the observers biases .
[native] in the same page you cited this appears in the first paragraph : > there are several theories advocating either a purely catalan or a purely aragonese origin for the symbol .
[native] this is a misunderstanding , they 're not clowns , [ just normal french people ] ( https://bohemianconnection.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/dsc02096.jpg ) .
[non-native] learning the idea and concept is more imagination ie the idea that come in our mind is not always true or fact that it is right .
[native] seems like the hate for croats is alive and well ...
[non-native] imporant thing of this thought is they always tried enjoy their life better than oldert people .
[non-native] the first time to experence something is always fun .
[native] now whether or not that 's effective is another topic .
[non-native] it will aid in gaining a lot more information about a place and one would feel that they have spent their time and money in a purposeful manner .it is stated that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
[native] maybe england could use the money gained from no longer paying the eu contribution to rebuild hadrian 's wall and re-garrison carlisle castle ?
[non-native] and as i have explained prior to this , i consider taking and realizing your chances to be of fundamental importance for success .
[non-native] to find success is to define it according to each mans wants and needs .
[non-native] quite on the contrary , one might argue that global society will have no choice but to use fewer cars in the future because of a shortage of oil .
[non-native] in addition to that the statment is a non credible statement because it is abviouly based on personal opinion rather than on facts , since it is not supported by statistics or any menaingfull numbers .
[non-native] in deed , to get a good price and good peole to ravel with them is a best way for relax and fun .its always good to have broad knowledge of many subjects as this is going to help the individual to deal with a variety of situations .
[native] what if they were assisting is * before * britain began bombing them ?
[non-native] `` risk '' means to go an alternative way .
[non-native] to decrease the negative impact , there should be some incentives and couraging factors for the youth to associate with their communities and socialize .
[non-native] this is for various reasons : first , the mere learning of facts is boring to most people , thus leading to lack of motivation and concentration .
[non-native] giving the advantages of boyh methods , i belive that when i go for a trip , i should organize the time in such a way that during some days i have to join a group with a tour guide and some days i will need to stay alone .
[native] i 'm sure scotland would do fine on its own but not without some challenges and obstacles it 'd have to face in the first few years of its independence .
[non-native] to my mind successful people are people who like risks , and who are better under pressure .
[native] that 's pretty much the case with most articles submitted here on a topic related to muslims or immigrants .
[non-native] the way how people sucessis they try things in new way !
[native] once more , linking to long articles instead of quoting the relevant bits or providing page references .
[native] my ex is a nuclear engineer , she finds the hysteria over how ` unsafe ' nuclear power plants ridiculous , no different to people complaining about power lines making them sick .
[native] the british labour party has moved too far to the right , so instead of voting for another left wing party , they 're voting for a thatcherite one ?
[native] fsb decided to capture the informant in the act - even if on estonian soil - and inadvertently or not snagged their estonian contact as well .
[non-native] for the reasons expressed above , it is really difficult to predict the future of modern transportation , but one thing seems clear : long term , tcars as we know them , will disappear and it 's not unlikely that this process will take place in the next decades .i agree with that statemant .
[non-native] people , who claim that older people enjoy life more , gives some reasons why older people enjoy more .
[native] even if russia sends troops into ukraine , the west is not going to threaten nuclear war .
[non-native] now a days technology brought up new changes in our life style and this impacts deeprooted in people use available resources in effective way .
[native] you can see the parallels relatively easily in the most recent quebec provincial election
[native] because of the psychological damage caused by religion , that girl is going to feel very exposed , undignified and embarrassed .
[native] tried to explain i was only there a few days and i was working for a british company ...
[non-native] this means that middle school and high schoolers have tremendously pressure in school because they are expected to get straight as and do all the community works in hope to get into their ideal colleges .
[non-native] thus it is the reflection of the qualities and character of an individual .i agree with this statement .
[native] true but most of those were developed in the 60s and early 70s .
[non-native] in conclusion , it it better to have knoeledge of many acadefor considering people 's opinions about usage of cars in the future , we have a variety of points of view to analyze .
[native] unfortunately yea , islam is one the big ideologies of this century , like marxism and capitalism , we have islam and secular humanism ( atheist/agnostic movement ) .
[non-native] as such reason , i support that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing wtat they already know how to do well .this statement is true and false at the same time .
[native] you know it 's not like importing furniture , right ?
[native] germany i see you talking about occupy and it makes me very ... . . nervous .
[non-native] i think every person is curious from the birth to death .
[non-native] ideas can form the basis to learn new facts about the particular area which you are about to know .
[non-native] because generally the number of the young people more than older bussiness owners focus on the young peoples preferences .
[native] i did n't say anything about legality , only the unfortunate facts .
[non-native] in fact , some people think that the number of cars in few years will grow up because of people need , other think the contrary , they assert that its must decreases because we will be in need of another type of transportation .
[native] the reason the city had those privileges was because it was extremely wealthy due to being at the mouth of a major river artery and used that wealth to buy rights by funding the crowns various endeavors .
[non-native] i agree with the statement that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are because of the following reasons :
[native] divided press is in my mind healthy in a democracy .
[non-native] though in wealthy countries , cars may not be a very expensive luxury to own , there are countries where people still save money with a dream to own a car one day which would make family trips and outings more convenient and enjoyable .
[native] [ a ] ( http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-01-10/guest-post-how-i-renounced-my-us-citizenship-and-why-part-1 ) [ b ] ( http://www.emirates247.com/news/i-accidentally-became-a-us-citizen-and-cannot-get-rid-of-the-passport-2013-11-23-1.528931 ) us does not recognize dual-citizenship .
[non-native] cellphone which produced early this year is already outmoded and 2 year-old laptop is not producing anymore .
[non-native] especilly men start to dream of a car starting from their childhood .
[native] locking these people up without evidence will just breed further hatred and resentment .
[non-native] we all know some people are very full of good luck but chance is also limited .
[non-native] in fact in this universe is most important the reserch .
[non-native] besides , young people tend to do more dangerous things than older people .
[native] ` company screwing with our laws ' sells way more papers than ` company disputes unfair government policies ' , i guess .
[non-native] for example a bike ride is not as comort when compared with a car it cause pain to shoulders
[native] what you 're saying is the law should never have any bias .
[non-native] however looking from the perspective of an old person , having lived his/her younger life in constant activity , lot more enjoyment is found in doing the other kind of things .
[native] > nah man serbs are guilty for the wwi , jews for ww2 , and african slaves for american civil war .
[native] but you also murdered anyone who was n't ukrainian during ww2 to get that awesome homogeneous population in the west , should have finished the job in the east and you would n't have had this problem .
[native] > i do n't have one , but i know lol
[native] what 's the fundamental difference between one day before they can be european , and one day after they can no longer be european ?
[native] it being homegrown in hk makes it even worse , those damn chinese with colonial hearts !
[non-native] as years pass by , the poupulation grows further .
[native] the baltic states in particular are in that periphery space i mentioned , which makes them even more susceptible to the russian designs and still part of the `` mapping '' activities , in this case testing the baltic states relationship with nato .
[non-native] history , geography , economy , physics , mathematics , and languages are essential to see follow our changing environment every days , not only at home , but also when we 're working .
[non-native] however , when people meet who works in diffrent field , if people know about others fields , they can have talk .
[non-native] when companies create a product , they want to get to as many people as they can , so they use advertisements on television , magazines , and even the internet in orther to announce their product .
[non-native] for instance an ant who wanted to climb a wall tried several times but failed .
[native] [ 10c 20c 50c $ 1 $ 2 ] ( https://inquisitivebird.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/new-zealand-2006-circulating-coins.jpg ) that 's it .
[non-native] there you need ideas or concepts which the teacher can give you to learn that language more easily .
[non-native] if someone wishes to specialize in one specific subject he
[native] everyone knows that only the uk spies on people .
[native] as a canadian , i support , in principle , free trade with europe .
[native] you 're lucky to find it so easy to pronounce things like that .
[non-native] on the other hand , young people do not have a doughter or son .
[native] if you want to reduce emissions then going nuclear is the best thing you can do .
[non-native] it has resulted in the creation of industrial giants .
[native] but atm , it 's through my mom due to the jus sanguinus stuff .
[non-native] also if you go there alone you can discover some other places that are not famous but interesting .
[non-native] concerning the petrol problem there is also hope in technical development such as electric drives for cars and trucks or solar technique .
[non-native] maybe it is also the fault of the society which build us up in a way that we don ' t really feel the need of helping our community .
[non-native] another example , when the katrina has hit the usa , basket ball teenagers organised a charity match between their fellow competitors and managed to gather about thirty thousand dollars for the victims .
[native] that 's like congratulating somebody after they get their foot chopped off .
[native] you can watch a [ film of masaryk 's funeral procession through the streets of prague ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv-ozhupru8 ) , edvard beneÅ¡ looks incredibly sad and broken during the ceremony .
[non-native] first , i want to go alone or my friends about my trip , because i da n't want to be led someone .
[non-native] but what is the best and how is it obtained
[native] including families more in the planning side made a perceptible impact in how many good soldiers nz could keep .
[non-native] in my opinion , this aim and this way to sell products violates the principle of self-determination and is morally wrong .
[native] or all the constant violence and oppression that 's been going on in between .
[non-native] most of the people they will not be interested in all the sujects , say , i never liked math and programming , i always liked biology , now will a person like me , will he be interested in learning all the other sujects effectively say math ?
[non-native] in their desire for enjoyment and willingness to try everything new and `` cool '' , they might use drugs .
[non-native] i know this things cause my college professors taught me to smart-thinking by making me undertanding all from the basics , i.e : nothing about memmory but yes in understanding .
[native] if the icj says it 's a mixed competence , then yes , all 28 national parliaments will have to ratify it as well .
[native] i think it 's more that you should primarily adopt the customs of the host country , but you 're free to bring in any cultural customs that can do n't clash with the host country - art , cuisine etc.
[non-native] now adays advertising and media is every thing to consumers .
[native] personally , i do n't think china or india will ever get a point where they challenge us supremacy .
[native] actually , based on what dg trade the the ec have said , it seems to be rather that the us will raise their standards towards european ones .
[native] unfortunately , the ecb does n't have the authority that the fed does on the issue , and authority is vital for central bank policy to work .
[non-native] hybrid cars had already hit the road a long time back .
[native] before the civil war , beirut was the `` paris of the middle east '' .
[non-native] for example , students too focused on one area might be in troubles to get along in group of other students discussing other topics and they might miss something they actually really like .
[non-native] it was not really possible to be owned by a normal individual .
[non-native] therefore , even they have time and money , sometimes they can not enjoy life .
[native] the ec is saying they did n't discuss this at the meeting .
[non-native] in the meanwhile , the population in developed countries keeps growing , what lead us to discard the idea of a possible reduction of vehicles on these developed countries .
[non-native] we have to accept the fact that being with their children is the most enjoyable thing to do .
[native] > brussels stepped in saying it was against state aid rules and has insisted on some changes .
[native] they 're presenting some news and then going off for a few minutes on their opinion of it while bantering back and forth .
[native] my view was only some trees and a parking lot .
[non-native] first and foremost , people will lead a more confortable and convenient life on condition that they have the knowledge of lots of different areas .
[native] that 's the kind of ridiculous shit you think is so farcical that it can not be serious .
[non-native] in my opinion , it is understandable that they do this .
[non-native] your personal experiences and your knowledge make you understand the world and to react in several daily situations .
[non-native] however , if students do n't concentrate during the reading or in the classes , they might learn , but they do n't understand the ideas and concepts that they suppose to cover .
[non-native] through essay , this idea is going to be disscused .
[native] unfortunately there 's been enough debate over qe and its effectiveness that it wo n't really work anymore in europe .
[native] this is a * huge * point , finland is under the umbrella of russian s-400s and the f-35 is designed to kill them .
[native] to represent modern europe maybe what 's left of the berlin wall , uncomfortable to look at and defiantly not pretty but has anything else done to change europe more ?
[native] while i agree hamas and the settlements suck , the reason the west bank is so poor is because it has a populace with some pretty crazy views .
[non-native] second , as mentioned in second paragraph , people need each other anyway in order to live .
[non-native] they had their own clear view towards community and spent lots of time taking part in developing society .
[native] second , devaluing the currency is a tax on everyone ( especially the poor ) and is all too easy for politicians to do to ignore the more complex structural issues their economies face - often no meaningful structural reform is executed in response to the problems that led to that state .
[native] > nuclear energy is n't a solution because of the waste problem oh please , take your mind out of the tabloid rags and walt-disney era storytelling ; nuclear waste has been safely and econmically stored for decades and this process is only going to get cheaper and safer with advancements , not * less * so .
[native] ( ( since then , as you may have missed , an efta court ruling ruled in iceland 's favour .
[non-native] if it can not so what we will do , we will ask ourselves or any other people .
[native] there certainly has been a rebound , but ( imho ) u4 is n't the best measure .
[native] yeah i 'm kinda surprised you guys did n't build a bigger military in ww2 or even know because ireland is literally still the best point to invade the uk from and we are n't exactly not making more enemys at the moment ( russia for a recent example ) .
[native] i have to say i like how that english guy handled that mess .
[non-native] with a deluge of these important activities and academic works , students nowadays can not devote themselves to their communities as much as the young people did in the past .
[native] guardian , daily mail , telegraph et al comments .
[non-native] thus , satisfying the demands of poor families in saudi arabia .
[non-native] to conclude , young people do n't really help their community and it is a behaviour that is surelly pittyful .
[non-native] so i went to thatcar shop and tried it , thier seats were like a stone .
[native] if it 's not he who should pay , then who ?
[native] the growth will be in areas that wo n't create many jobs , compared to the numbers they will replace .
[native] seriously , most of you guys all have the same currency and the same passports , and no restriction on travel , and multlple languages used in the same are already .
[native] there 's no point in pretending it does n't exist .
[non-native] i once heard that it can increase the possibility of getting cancers .
[native] no one suspected rebels would use a missile launcher to shoot down a commercial aircraft .
[non-native] so once when we reach this place and visit places like brahma temple which is one of its kind in the whole world , from these tour guides we will get to know more about the temple , the history , other significance etc .
[native] there 's always plenty of negative news about russia ( or any other place , but let 's face it , definitely about russia ) .
[non-native] that is the same way when you are looking for a lawyer .
[non-native] if i had not studied environment course , i might not recognized that osaka gas is good company this example strongly shows that we may as well study broad knowledge .
[native] i 'd have to say that the atrocities of stalin were equal to that of hitler , but trying to find a `` winner '' between them is ludicrous .
[native] in february 2001 , the solicitor of a former bae systems employee , edward cunningham , notified serious fraud office of the evidence that his client was holding which related to an alleged `` slush fund '' > 1992 nao report [ edit ] the uk national audit office investigated the contracts and has so far not released its conclusions -- the only nao report ever to be withheld
[native] > ireland : we like to think that you are pretty much like us .
[native] this could easily be done across the america-mexican , or the ( albeit nato-nato ) american-canadian border .
[native] given the amount of pressure american tech companies are under due to nsa spying , assurances from our government that `` ireland is a data haven '' would have every international company banking on our door to do business without need for tax haven status but again progressive policy 's looking to the future is not ireland 's thing is seems and looks like iceland wants to take that datacentre niece all for itself now .
[non-native] technology is improving and in business life only innovative people gain much money .
[non-native] also , by developing the internet , young people often play games and chat with friends in the online .
[non-native] it indeed seems that the youth are more energetic and many new things around us are created by them , however the old people also enjoy their life in their own way , which may be no less than the youth do .
[non-native] it opens you for alternative explanations and solutions and might even make you into a more tolerant person .
[non-native] finally , and it might be the most important point is the way the society look at older people versuse young ones .
[native] > you made a disingenuous comment seemingly suggesting that the embassies statements should be treated in the same way libel is treated .
[non-native] these are not my main goals to a chieve .
[native] they support a [ basic income ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/basicincome ) , making them perhaps the largest , most influential political party currently in existence to do so .
[native] if they have not been convicted , they are not criminals .
[non-native] so in a society , where knowledge is becoming more and more important we need people who are the best in their subject and not people , who only know a little bit about everything .
[native] countries probably will not be able to say no , [ as that would be a trade barrier ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_ppqnbxpa4 ) .
[non-native] but nowadays scientits want to make people aware of the danger of cars .
[native] estonia is nato and eu , the response would be quite different .
[native] the idea of blasphemy is complete bullshit if you think about it .
[native] if the uk attacked the us would they be obligated as part of nato to also declare war on themselves ?
[native] the problem is that these tests are very expensive , even if you have decent health insurance .
[native] > however , i prefer the uk leaving to the uk deciding to violate eu rules and getting away with it .
[non-native] people who are successful in share markets are prone to huge risk and losses but all the leading men in share companies take risk and are successful also .
[non-native] on the contrast the younger ones want to go on date with his/her mate this evening , he wants to purchase the latest gadgets melting the ice in the city with its features and hottie looks , what about the latest cars , and wardrobe thats in .
[non-native] imagine the laughters of friends when you say are helping an old lady while they are going to play basketball !
[non-native] in every risk you take there is a chance of failure , but if you get afraid of failing you will also wo n't get successful .
[non-native] since they move with a group , all the things will be chaper than travelling individually .
[non-native] ever since transportations developed amagingly , the world gets closer .
[native] > but that does n't matter it does matter , you would n't exist if your great grandfather was n't from austria , you would n't exist if it were n't for an immigrant .
[non-native] second , i will give a different example about korea korea has good it tecqnology .
[native] the propaganda had zero effect except discrediting the already differentiated editorial sections even more .
[native] 70 % of the eu 's agricultural imports already come from third world countries .
[non-native] some people say that having knowledge in one specific subjet is more useful for people , because they can study much deeply about a certain subject .
[native] now we 're having another tax dumped on top of us by a crony-filled organisation that 's also a shambles .
[non-native] however , today most of the young think they do n't have time to do that .
[native] you 'll want to do a bit more work at that start to minimize the potential for legitimate unexpected costs ( you do n't want the winning bidder to declare bankruptcy and walk away ) , but this has been applied in a number of places .
[native] there have been muslims in europe going back more than a thousand years , even if it did n't become the dominant religion .
[non-native] when i was studied in secondary schoo math is difficult subject to me .
[native] it 's like the cold fusion a nice idea , but far from reality .
[non-native] he said , `` customers wo n't like what you cook by this way . ''
[non-native] a s a resutl , the company would lose a lot of money because other people would be encouraqged to do so due incoorect information might be exposed on some advertiements .
[non-native] mant peoplle believe that the young enjoy their life more than older people do .
[non-native] according to a survey , more than a seventy percent of highschool students had not enough time to do other things beside studying .
[native] however , we simply have no need to go into a perpetual war state like america .
[non-native] also buy spending more on advertisement there is no economical benefit for the consumer , in order to attract more consumers , the price of the product should be reduced .
[native] --------------------------- not everyone gets tipped `` because living wage '' - a lot of the time it 's just because you want service at a reasonable speed from someone who has to prioritize a lot ( bartenders ) .
[native] finally , how do you know that any increase in spending for weaker countries wont go straight into house prices and cost of living expenses ( not that britain or germany are doing particularly convincing jobs of containing those themselves ) .
[native] in fact the us has more tolerant views than the majority of europe , according to two [ swedish economists ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/05/15/a-fascinating-map-of-the-worlds-most-and-least-racially-tolerant-countries/ ) .
[non-native] first , we have to admit that the youth , due to their age and physical strength , are more likely to take part in some fierce and competitive acitivities , such as football , disco dancing , bungee etc , therefore , their life are full of thrills and challenges more probably .
[native] i work for a german company in dublin , almost every german i 've met has an excellent grasp of english .
[native] it 's pretty damn well known that such cumulative graphs are purposefully misleading as well , by the way .
[native] : / also , in my dad 's idiolect '' < noun > # 6 '' means '' < noun > my ass '' , probably same origin .
[non-native] they go to desenyland and have so much fun they also think of some new interesting things to do .
[non-native] such an example shows that studying broadly can help us become more competitive .
[non-native] they just talking about the past and what did they do in them life .
[native] so it 's not the swedish ruling coalition that advocates this , it 's a few academics recommending that that 's what the ruling coalition do .
[native] i fail to see how that 's them ` abusing the asylum system ' , as opposed to a bunch of uneducated and fearful people worried about their future .
[native] first come first serve ensures the people who really want to see the movie arrive early and get the best seats while the plebs who show up during the trailers are stuck in shit seats , it works .
[native] there are countries that would be better off outside and ones wholly dependent on it , it 's a tinderbox of uneasy alliances between states that are 50 + years away from the vague economic parity that 's aimed for .
[non-native] in short , we can say that a undergraduate level student needs to have broad knowledge of many subjects and a graduate level student can specialize in one specific subject .i disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
[non-native] during earlier times people manufactured the goods where they were used afterwards .
[non-native] i 'm also belong volunteer club which is teaching japanese to foreigners .
[non-native] but there are notable exeptions and a lot of sport groups , boy scouts or christian ( or any other religion ) youth organisations wo n't work without the time and efforts devoted by teenagers and people in their early twenties .
[non-native] finally learning is in gerenal more based on knowledge that teachers can give to their students in order to improve and develop their critical analysis .i agree successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well because of several reasons .
[non-native] this will encourage more number of people to buy cars .
[native] for one simple reason : * conventional superiority of nato & the almost guaranteed use of tactical nuclear weapons by russia because of it .
[non-native] writing books or essays on a specific topic could enable her to gain more prestige as well as more money .
[native] probably the greatest city on the european continent that most tourists have never heard of before .
[native] in the euro-zone : germany is expected to buy more southern european goods or straight transfer capital .
[non-native] in addition this type of knowledge permits you to understand , .
[non-native] this include enhance the use of public transportation , foster the use of bycicles in cities and so on .
[non-native] i think in twenty years there will be more cars in use than there are today .
[native] probably considerably fewer than would 've died in syria .
[non-native] i am sure that no one will change this behaviour , unless he or she is forced to do so .
[non-native] for example the person is very successful in europe and now wants to be also successful in america .
[non-native] lastly , change is a different decision in the human 's life , but it is important for many good reasons , and gets back on the human with good benefits .i agree that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
[non-native] forthemore , having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is to make the students get used to the world now as well as to let them have a wide choose for the future .
[non-native] apart from that , i believe that you ca n't make any progress if you stay persistently at the same level .
[non-native] firstly , coming to the family they live in , they dedicate enough time towards their family members and help them in all possible ways .
[non-native] these shoes were not so stable and even not such comfortable like it was said .
[native] the idea that a layperson 's opinion is as valid as an experts is ridiculous , and yet here we are .
[non-native] it follows then that even if ideas are more important when we take a step back , we do not understand them right away without any facts or dates .

[native] > i do n't see you bringing up that finns or sami have been treated as 2nd class citizens when it was a lot worse than it is today .

[native] the canadian centre for policy alternatives is a think tank financed principally through canadian unions , union movements being those traditionally most stubbornly opposed to ftas .
[native] council is suppose to preserve states rights , so state representatives of your elected government have a voice in forming legislation .
[native] the problem when people critique things like that , especially black-americans , is mainly knee-jerk reactions to them initially seeing it .

[non-native] the young people are getting isolated from their own communities .
[non-native] in conclusion , for these reasons , spending much money and insuficient space to park cars , i agree the statement `` there will be fewer cars than there are today in twenty years . ''some people are called successful people because they try for something that others can not achieve so easily .
[native] several countries have high levels of both but there is no statistical correlation .
[native] southern italy gets a lot of investment as well .
[native] what can i say , i 'd like to either live in europe or japan .

[native] we should n't judge them all billion + based off of a few unpleasant encounters .

[non-native] which one would you buy , the small company 's cheap but nice one , or the big company 's more expensive , but ween on tv one ?
[non-native] thus , i do n't consider that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
[non-native] that is , in other words , age can sometimes be a hinderance towards living life to its fullest , and of course enjoying it to very far extents and dimensions .

[native] > `` for a long period of time i 've taken notes and i was always comparing what is said in the room and what is said outside the room .
[non-native] advertisements are made to sell products in more efficient way .
[non-native] so this problem like the my accident happened many places .
[non-native] in conclusion , there is a saying that `` teach him ` how to get fish ' , do n't teach him ` how to eat fish ' '' .
[non-native] i 'd like to support my statement by mentioning following points and examples :
[non-native] because nowadays peoples has so many convinient tools and living under the good enviroments .
[native] you might be the only person to call dan carlin a `` leftwing commentator '' .
[native] mainly , i like europeans and this is a great sub-reddit .
[native] this will then provide a larger market for goods and services , which currently predominantly come from the rich countries .
[non-native] i 'm not sure about the point of part of it says `` cars in use '' .
[native] [ also , a whole range of studies have indicated that the uk is less xenopobic than italy .

[non-native] everyone loves things with nice apperance and the companies use this physology to earn people 's money .
[native] there 's a strong vein of common sense running through the british character ; i just do n't see them being that barmy .
[native] ** britain : ** you gave the world harry potter , james bond , doctor who , the beatles and trainspotting .
[non-native] also you can still succeed even though you do not try new things rather than onlu doing what you already know how to do well .
[native] if i find these , i 'll give em a try .
[native] as its a trade deal , its irreversible without paying compensation for potential future profits .
[non-native] that 's the reason why i regard facts are more important .
[native] but hoping to move to bangalore later next year .
[native] that stinks of mentally unstable , or something more clandestina - both of which the kurds would be worried about .
[non-native] however , the real product is not really like the advertisement .
[non-native] sometimes , i say to myself `` care about process than a fact '' because it is easy to forget and only look for a fact .the statement `` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' has been often said .
[native] but nobody likes to feel like they might be being watched .
[native] you are absolutely insane if you think any country has more soft or real power on world events than the u.s.
[non-native] not only that lately many young people are suffering from lot of stress because of work load .
[native] all this is going is make russian propaganda look true , `` nazis from the west coming to attack mother russia '' .
[native] just a quick historical note : stalin murdered more millions of people than hitler .
[native] i do agree that the method of payment is stupid but it is cameron who has turned this into a crisis .

[native] i belive that democratic socialism is difficult to realize in most cases because a true socialist state requires ideological unity .
[non-native] but this relaxation is the point why they are not successful as other people are .
[non-native] so , i would like to compare some points .
[native] if you 're going to suggest ` structual issues ' and ` competativeness ' address the costs ( affects competativeness ) and labour/energy markets instead of the current free market/central-bank-intervention solutions .
[native] it was interesting to see people walking around openly carrying pistols and other weapons , just in plain view .
[non-native] in most countries all over the world , studying is not for free .
[non-native] these nine month gave me the oppertunity to help old people , speak and listen to him and to give them a good feeling .
[native] even more popular - companies etc tend to open official `` subtiebas '' instead of hosting their own forums for example .
[native] surprisingly , if you clean the dirt off them and blast them at unlivable temperatures then they are seemingly edible .
[native] we need to find new ways for small towns to prosper not cling on to inefficient ways of doing things .
[non-native] so to sum it up , though it is important to do well what you know , you always need to have the desire to try out new thigs and the pluck to take risks to come out on top and be successful .
[non-native] in fact the humberger increase the bad colestrol , and it couse alot of heart problems such as the hart attack .

[non-native] from advertisement , people always see the good looking of the products .
[native] like banning minarets , and screwing up their treaties with the eu ?
[non-native] at the same time knowledge in many academic subjects gives you a wide variety of knowledge and you will be having lot of chances to go through and also for the jobs .
[native] it suppresses true knowledge by substituting it with foolish mysticism .
[native] and shit , that 's not even touching anything from maine to panama .
[native] all is well calculated , and very rational on both sides .
[native] belize does n't feature , but then belize does n't know if they speal english or a kriol undifferentiated from english .
[native] gulags were for political dissidents and were not intended to kill people straight up , they were labour camps and the majority of people who went there survived to tell the tale .
[non-native] but the aim is to increase some capability to think by themselves and not discuss about a subject only in telling the facts he or she learns before witout any construction in their comment or their way of thinking .
[native] i hardly think that a woman walking up to the judge , lifting her veil and having her identity confirmed deserves to be placed in the same category as fisa .
[non-native] a easier way to reduce the number of cars would also be to expand hugely the different forms of transport like train , bus and subways in a way that cars will become unnecessary .
[native] imagine being a shop owner who has to buy and sell products and keep stocks : his operating environment can now fluctuate wildly which makes business very difficult .
[native] also , as i said , the canadian supreme court is not politicized the way the american one is .
[native] reforming the education system using new methods that cater much more to the individual rather than meeting systemic quotas as well as a communalisation of the system 10 .
[native] any time sweden is mentioned in r/worldnews ( or any news site ) , it 's always flooded with comments on how it is turning into an islamic theocracy where ethnic swede women are raped en-masse on the streets by evil brown people because emasculated , gay swedish men are too cowardly to protect them .
[non-native] some might be doing all right because they have been doing the same kind of job over and over again .
[non-native] we know that alternative vehicles are growing faster ( think at the ecological bus ) ..
[non-native] the second is that the future of a person with a broad knowledge is uncertain for several years .i do not think travelling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel .
[non-native] and by destroying a case he would end himself in prison .
[non-native] consequently , the economical purpose of the producers of the advertisements about their products may result in illustrating these products much more better than they really are .
[native] cotton is actually fire retardant so whereas a neckbeard/hipster in a trillby is likely to leave behind a charred corpse and hat , a noire detective in the 1950 's would likely leave behind a charred corpse and singed hat .
[native] a number of recent surveys indicate that [ ttip will be bad for jobs ] ( http://www.ttip2014.eu/blog-detail/blog/ttip%20jobs.html ) . .
[non-native] although some young people are getting enough time to help others they are simply wasting their time .
[native] i 'm not using that as evidence to show immigration is bad .

[native] you 're not helping your argument by basically providing heinous shit the west does as justification for the heinous shit russia is doing .
[non-native] it make my work easy in mobile repairing , by having some idea about the subject in advance .
[non-native] advertisement does good to the product because most of the people rely on the advertisements .
[non-native] this activity in based on the specific subject and the broad knowledge can be less specific .
[native] the idea of australians calling europeans racist is hilarious .
[native] yeah , so the problem is n't the system we currently have in place , it 's that the system is n't being used .
[non-native] one of the crucial reason in the unreliability of most advertisements in conveying information about the products is caused by the economical aspects .
[non-native] to find out , you need to ask yourselves : `` how did he or she died and who killed them ? ''
[native] ) ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2h7d10/us_corporate_interests_british_lawmakers_excited/ckqf0m3 ) that 's right , he thinks there 's some shadowy cabal controlling the ttip negotiations specifically to undermine the social contract .
[native] this kind of duplicitous smug-faced savagery should n't be allowed within the borders of europe .
[non-native] of course a tour guide knows about the location where is not safe enough to go so they wo n't go to the dangerous side of city .
[native] france , belgium and italy decided not to transpose it into national law .
[non-native] the young people can enjoy more than the old people due to the following reasons .
[non-native] most people would not want to give up on their cars or their dreams to have a car .
[native] a stickied thread is a thread on reddit where the title of the thread is highlighted bold in green and stuck to the very top of a subreddit .
[native] my father , who is a reasonably-high-up official in a government department , believes that `` bloody foreigners just come here to rape , murder , steal benefits and take jobs away .
[native] there are plenty of cult compounds that nobody who does n't believe in jesus 's ufo chariot ca n't enter into either , but these are irrelevant places .
[native] she did n't say she opposed it because it was islamophobic , as the huffpo claims , but rather because criticism of the is was used as justification for islamophobia .
[native] it might well be one of the most cost-efficient bureaucracies in the world .
[non-native] for example they could have more sophisticated circuit that allow to the driver to orientate whatever is his destination or they would be less polluting than one , perhaps with a non polluted system which convert the carbon dioxide into oxygen preventing all the diseases that characherize the urban citizen but , on the other hand , if there will be more cars , it would create an overcrowding in the street : all the people who have the car in fact use it almost the daytime and with the crowding of the streets. , the man ' / women 's attitude could change giving origin to some unpleasant events in conclusion , i think that , if in the future , there will be an increasing of the car , which in my opinion will occur , i hope the people learn to use it in a properly way .it is debatable whether people have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
[native] in some respects , farage and snp are symptoms of the same phenomenon : when there are question marks hanging over the constitution ( should scotland be in uk , or uk in eu ) normal left-right politics breaks down .
[non-native] but there are no lies in them , just a little more than truth !from my point of view , it would be really an impressive option to have the better knowledge of many academic subjects .
[non-native] i will try to make a short list of these incentives .
[native] i do find that people complain i 'm blunt offline , but not online .
[non-native] but his anxiety and strong determination makes him now a president of india .
[native] so my suggestion of negotiations is worse than your reality of bombing apartment buildings .

[native] it was the polish capital for centuries and withstood countless wars and rebellions .
[non-native] the world is changing , the challenges are becoming greater , cut-throat competition is taking place nowadays and thus only the best of the best can survive in todays world where people are continously striving to reach higher in life .
[native] i 'd imagine similar in the netherlands as well .
[non-native] the are subjected to risk of their lifes from terrorists and opposition also but this doesnt stop them and they are all world class suceesful leaders .
[native] there are plenty of circumstances in which courts are held privately .
[non-native] when i went to france with a small group of people with a tour guide , the guide took us the restaurant where he usually goes .
[non-native] so there will be fewer cars in use than therethe idea that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are has growned to be old-fashioned and too simplistic .
[non-native] after some time , the youngsters get to see the serious and dark side of the life .
[non-native] there exists for example a tv-spot where a handsome girl watches a big screen with an ice-cream on it and while watching it dissapears and suddenly sit 's on an tropic island .
[non-native] the reason behind it is they hire the person who has a mastership on related research areas such as computers or electronic science .
[native] japan is launching new carriers and submarines , south korea , japan , and australia are modernizing their air forces with f-35s , india is developing the pak-fa with russia , and even vietnam is purchasing kilo attack subs .

[native] > do n't seem to have noticed that america has become the centre of the english-speaking world everyone has noticed that .

[native] well , we had that riot in france in which they burned synogogues and jewish stores , the neo-nazis chants during `` anti-israel '' protests in germany , the hitler salutes in the uk , and the assault and ethnic slur of a jewish american by a student `` for justice in palestine '' .
[native] regardless , national discrimination or ethnic discrimination still falls under the category of racism iirc .
[non-native] furthermore , we ought to open our mind and eyes to experience new fields .
[native] edit : an alternative might be the studies commissioned by the european commission , such as [ this one ] ( http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2013/march/tradoc_150737.pdf ) done by the centre for economic policy research , a very respected think tank .

[non-native] the amound of time that young people spend on their communities is small compared to the young people in the past .
[non-native] it is by taking chances and risks one can do creative works .

[non-native] advertisements create many false declarations and we can see when we buy a product that it is completely different .
[non-native] i agree because if you have a person that know about the place that you are going to or you are visiting , he can give you an explain about the history , about the lifestile , the culture , the food , etc. in the other way if you go somewhere and you do not know nothing about it , for example where is a museum , a typical place , a chuch , etc. then you have to search for yourself all the places that you should visit and it problably will take you some time , that you can spend in other places .

[non-native] that the best evidence for me thati strongly disagree with the quote .
[non-native] in my opinion , most advertisements demonstrate the products not as they really are because of the some reasons such as economical , social and political reasons .

[native] look up the [ definition here ] ( http://www.thefreedictionary.com/criminal ) .

[native] ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=od4outxvtru ) but that kind of thing also happened on the other side of the iron curtain too .
[non-native] the reasons that i disagree with this statment ; for example , young people studying hard , communicate with other people , and trying to convice old people with them ideas .
[non-native] i believe that older people like life more than young people do because of many reasons .
[native] it 's not exactly difficult to get a feel for what currency is worth once you see the value of basic things like bottles of coca cola , pints of milk or loaves of bread .

[non-native] specially by being well informed of the product being advertised in order to judge not only visually , the quality of the product .
[non-native] so if we are a bit cautious in driving than personal cars are more advantageous and i conclude that in the coming years everybody prefer cars .i do n't agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
[non-native] i 'm actually wondering if certain firms could give money to people who fill up their car to drive to work .
[native] i 'm saying that migration as part of a larger economic partnership needs to be managed as any resource is managed , such as capital or electricity in a centrally-planned federalist system .
[non-native] having the possibility to have more lifes i would surely try both approaches , attending specializing courses and lessons on a subject or few of them , then trying to find my way through , also having a broad knowledge of many acadamic subjects .
[native] the great bear of mother russia of course ;) http://rlv.zcache.com/communist_red_bear_sticker-r49a8cdb274834bc291e3fcc607a9f60d_v9wxo_8byvr_512.jpg
[native] obviously the current icelandic government does n't want to continue , but this is clearly something that should either be frozen for the next government to deal with or put to a referendum .
[native] the problem is that the production line jobs simply are n't there anymore , and the few that are there pay poorly and are restricted from unionising .
[non-native] the broad knowledge of many academic subject is the point of start for the dinamismi do not completely agree with the statement that in twenty years of time there will be fewer cars in use as compared to the present .

[native] if these countries do n't want to reform , then they do n't have to take the money .
[non-native] understanding is the best way to learn said by my teacher .
[non-native] studying has been an important fact on why kids can not help their communities as much as they use to as well .
[non-native] last year there was a certain awareness concerning avian flu , and there was no single day without the news reporting about it .
[native] i think there 's less of an appetite among the public to leave now , but we could be sleepwalking towards an exit anyway .
[non-native] and the second reason is we can see more places in the tour .
[non-native] so you ca n't understand further facts without them .
[native] so no , europe will do nothing and blame the americans as per usual .
[non-native] and the other one is pollution free environment , which is very much important now due to gobal warming coming as a major consequence in the nature .
[non-native] more importantly , the government also places a great emphasise in ensuring the young people to give sufficient time to helping their communities .
[non-native] i even support the counter point that a person should not restrict his/her knowledge but even the a person should be a master of one and then of course become a jack of all trades .
[non-native] for example we have a big house with 6 floors .
[non-native] considering from the point mentioned above , i think that young people do not have enough time to spend for community activities .
[non-native] jai hind .i really agrea with the point that says most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are .
[native] if people would just take time to educate themselves about economics and how money works it might help more people understand what it takes to build an economy .
[native] i once heard a swedish girl in one of my masters classes ( who i 'd always seen as the typical kind of non-racist , progressive voice ) say in all seriousness that she 'd always hire a swede over a foreigner because she just knew they 'd be better and she did n't want to deal with foreigners .
[non-native] i believe that the rennaissance-man , a person who knows a lot about many subjects , like leonardo da vinci , still should be the ideal for all of us - even if this might sound a bit outdated .
[non-native] i agree successful people try new things , because this life is rarely advantage .
[native] in general , im trying to clarify people 's misconceptions about international negotiation procedures , how treaties are ratified , and so on .
[non-native] it needs work and work until you transfer to your second life .
[non-native] with this process two catogories of people are very happy , thisis very good .
[non-native] on the other hand , the impact with the real working life can be require a specialization in a specific field of knowledge , so a person that studied with this in mind , maybe will find work more easily using his specific attitude .
[native] if you ask anyone living in that city at that time , they would identify as polish because that was the posh thing at the time .
[native] they 're not claiming lost profits or anything as the cause for the suing ( that 's what they want in damages ) , rather they claim that the government expropriated without compensation their intellectual property - their trademark , brand name , brand associated goodwill , etc.

[non-native] but on closer inspection , cars use less and less oil .
[non-native] in the end , i would refear that young poeple should do thier jobs and help their community to rise and be better .yes , i believe that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
[non-native] almost every secondary or high school student participates in community service on a regular basis .
[non-native] cars represent a threat for this and therefore they will dissapear .
[native] things like cat scans , mris , blood tests , and other radiology tests are fairly common to rule out potential disorders .
[non-native] however , they should not necessarily be blamed for this ; we just need to give them a sense of community to make them want to participate in that community ; it is up to parents and to the educational system to achieve this for a better world .i strongly agree with this statement , everyone who has being successful has taken some sort of risk at some point in their lives .
[native] ( my source is my old country - other countries might have slightly different situation . )
[native] the truth is , whenever you see ads about childcare , you can expect to here `` mum '' or `` mam '' , but the word `` dad '' rarely seems to come up unless it 's for comedic effect .
[native] and it 's really hard to force a change if society does n't actually care about the people who are having their rights infringed .
[non-native] nowadays still many people in china is poor , but as long as the country continues to recover , more and more cars will be demanded .
[native] to be granted , poland did inflict heavy losses in the first few days and did well for the army inequalities , but they certainly did not have a chance of defending themselves .
[native] what reforms do they want and what direction would they take the eu ?
[non-native] in order to understand this fact , the reason behind the success and the ways of succession should be investigated .
[non-native] moreover , the car in the advertisement looks bright and very clean .
[native] i 'm fairly sure winters are better in new zealand than the netherlands , they definitely are in auckland .

[native] last i checked the irish state was co-guarantors of the good friday agreement with the british government thats a long way away from telling them to ` fuck off ' .
[native] it does n't mean your equally big neighbours have to acknowledge me .
[non-native] on the other hand , we must not teach the student any thing , not related to his subject , so he will not loss his time .
[non-native] but i do n't mean that young people are nowadays unkind but mean that they are looking at other place , not thier community .
[native] its sort of like in netherlands they have zwarte piet where people dress in black face as santa 's helper .
[non-native] another thing is that the young people are more active and have more potinsules , so they can effored more than the older ones and they truly can rise their community by helping it and taking with it hand .
[native] our media would jump at it , there would be stories that the president has lost it and had a mini meltdown .
[non-native] that was a nice memory for us even today .
[native] business therefore could adjust to the new market conditions and credit loosened up .
[non-native] besides , students also can use the ideas properly or invent their own new ideas .
[non-native] i might take advantage of making some relationships and making some friends .
[native] it 's the same in the us , by stopping 5x more black people they end up putting more black people in jail .
[native] the implementation was fine , maybe not ideal , but fine .
[non-native] i do not belive that , this makes them enjoy life less than the young people .
[non-native] i think it affects in many ways of our socity .
[native] the sad unfortunate fact is that the west does n't `` want '' ukraine , they just want to deny russia of ukraine .
[non-native] changing few habby 's will save our world .some people might say that young people nowadays have enough time to help the communities around them .
[native] > hey , some of those ukrainians support a guy we do n't like , so what we should to is side with russia , who also hates us and charges us the highest gas prices in europe , who has been an existential threat for more than 400 years and is getting more and more belligerent , instead .
[native] is n't that a little irrelevant since normandy is just temporarily occupied english clay ?
[native] cool story bro you were in the soviet bloc .
[non-native] this is because many people are travelling with us .
[non-native] but if you have a little knowledge of many subjects , you end up nowhere .
[non-native] cut to 2006 , we see hundereds of car models flooded in indian market and many more roaring to get in .
[non-native] the society we belong to change his habit in order to improve the world they live in .
[native] another key part , sow confusion and whataboutism in the media and online ( ahem ) so that your useful idiots delay things just long enough to water down any response .
[non-native] u can make sports , go out with your girlfriend , go a lot of entartainments etc . ..
[native] i 'm thankful for that and willingly and happily pay taxes for it to be so .
[native] not sure how much we can contribute more then nations already joined can but canada has always done a lot more with a lot less .
[non-native] so we would like to work hard on understanding the ideas and concepts even though we are unable to understand .
[native] ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ka6ki1v.png ) in short , roughly half a million girls from all major eu countries have been subjected to or are at risk of fgm .
[non-native] there are many examples where young people have worked together in harmony to achieve results that were surprising .
[non-native] first , many people who live in local place will be not able to use the official translation system , trains and buses .
[non-native] although it is very strictly followed in government offices , it holds strong enough in the private enterprises too .
[non-native] everyone wants to learn more and more inorder to compete with the computer generation .
[native] also , it does look like they are tied off and have hard hats .
[native] if you do n't count river/lakes/ocean , and just land , the us has more land area .
[native] bitcoins are purely at the mercy of supply and demand and is backed by no government so may lose their value at any moment and leave you with nothing but an electronic memory .
[non-native] though young people are usually considered as lazy and selfish and without any particular interest towards social or cultural problems , i do not think that they actually are .
[native] nations are much more than just a collection of people but i do n't want to start talking sociology .
[non-native] actually , lots of successful people know this fact and they try to new things in their various places or conditions .
[native] as always , stories like this are never anywhere near as black and white as they seem .
[native] there is definitely a lighter flavor and consistency with instant coffee and i much prefer the heavier flavor of brewing the bean .
[native] which is what happens with chain smokers who become physiologically dependant on continuing their habbit .
[non-native] the company wolud rather pick the most specialized person with the most broad knownledge .
[native] it 's just a coincidence that the crash site is between the two major separatists centers .

[native] `` in the state of nature , liberty consists of being free from any superior power on earth .
[native] tryavna and koprivshtitsa also had great bulgarian national revival architecture .
[native] yes , the eu defence capabilities could probably do with some upgrades and as i already pointed out , i 'd like to see a big increase in cohesion .
[non-native] to conclude i would like to quote jacob arnold a renowned author who once stated that , `` the pillar stone of any community is not the work carried out in it , but it is the participation of the youth in carriying out the community work counts '' .nowadays young student is so pity because they have no time to other activities except study .
[native] will this lead to less people trying to get to europe by boat ?
[native] because if that 's the case , he 's certainly no jon stewart .

[non-native] to answer the question is necessary , previously , to explain better the issue , because the mainly topic , according my attitude , is what you want to do in your life , what is your porpuse , who want to become .
[native] the bit where they try to hammer home the ` tax haven ' accusation .
[native] i 'm not even touching the second part of that post , mind .
[native] it was the serbs that broke the march 13 agreement with bulgaria which demarcated their respective gains in macedonia , taking land they had agreed would be bulgarian , which makes your ethical case difficult to argue .
[native] i disagree , and think that state controlled mechanisms will be sufficient , as the common currency ensures states have a vested interest in each others success .
[non-native] however , those who try to change doing new things or inventing something are soccessful people like he or she who changed his or her hairstyle above .
[non-native] there are many entrepreneurial ideas that never succeed and also several skilled people who arent successful , but the chances of a skilled person being successful is higher than a risk takers .
[non-native] i do acknowledge that there may be situations in which it may prove better to stick to what you are used to do .
[native] the freedom to devalue our currency is another factor , and it is interesting that economic interests rather than separatist interests may yet divide europe again .
[native] the british authorities can only dream of being like them .
[native] so , if you 're looking at the `` it 's great in theory but failed in practice '' thing , it does n't really work here .
[non-native] on the other hand , it is more common for older people to have thoses responsiblities which hold them from enjoying life and doing fun stuff .
[native] i think its the jewish vote and the jewish lobbying that has enough influence for america to at least be indifferent on the issue .
[native] shitty religious intolerance , but super nice people and awesome culture / food .
[non-native] in addition to that if everyone for that matter gets chance to know their area of interest in other word get specific knowledge their feild will be of great help to society since they will be contributing lot in inventing things thereby helping to solve the problems which are yeat be digged .
[non-native] moreover , young people also want to have their own cars , which makes them `` cool '' .
[non-native] if a student start to learn something first of all she/he must know the name of the idea and than the information about the idea for using it .

[non-native] in order to solve the growth of population and the number of citizen , many countries build up their public transportation system .
[non-native] first of all , if it is true why do not we act against it .
[non-native] i think there are various arguments to support it .
[native] why are so many of them wearing hats indoors ?
[native] the weakening of the powers of unaccountable secret services ( mi5/6 ) and bureaucracies and reigning in the infringements upon the privacy of the people 12 .
[native] however , that fear is useful politically , as it is in most countries , to maintain support for the government by pointing to the boogieman outside the gates .
[native] solar storms causing loss of the power grid , leading to loss of power for extended periods ( up to several years ! )
[non-native] if we think about a person who close himself to the new things , he would repeat himself at that work .

[non-native] even the old saying goes `` a picture worths more than a thouthand words '' , it does n't apply on all products we see on advertisements nowadays .nowadays , there are some kind of ways to learn something which have never taken before in personal .
[native] high-regulation countries with large public sectors ( italy , france , spain , greece ) would be greatly emboldened .
[non-native] in addition , the money is another factor , which can affect my decision .
[non-native] at that time , the service of many lines of japan national railway in hokkaido was stopped .
[non-native] govermants should enforece or emphizis their roles in this byy stricts those advertisments and pass an regulation that punish any company which try to mislead people .
[non-native] no one would want to buy something that looks dull , uninteresting .
[non-native] this is the only opportunity to solve and to get along with problems in a successfull way .
[non-native] if ever you manage to overcome the problems of young age , you do n't have the necessary wisdom to enjoy life .

[non-native] one another major reason for this the rapid increase in the number of roadways avaliable in the world .
[native] i would use it for toilet paper but even it 's physical quality is so low i would n't dare .

[native] after doing a bit of googling it looks like italy also has a concept called `` matrimonio fittizio o di convenienza '' which seems to be contrary to your civil code .
[non-native] it is very important to specialize you knowledge in one specific subject .
[non-native] sometime she say me that my body have painful , i do n't like a husband .
[non-native] i think it greatly depends in which category or area someone who is successful takes risks .

[non-native] in this context , i agree with the last one that promotes the idea of having a broader knowledge than a specialized one .
[native] i realise you 've made being anti-ttip and anti-tisa a part of your identity , that you think you 're intelligent for ` working this stuff out ' , but you have n't and you should drop it because you just show yourself to be a fool .
[non-native] finally , if they can sell stuff that way why do they collect and replace their faulty product .
[non-native] they have too much tasks , so young people can not go for helping community .yes , i agree to try anew things but take the rick on my attionation .the business of selling products is quite hard .
[native] although they speak russian in everyday life , from my experience , most younger ukrainians in the east still speak fluent ukrainian and identify themselves more with the the national language .
[native] the right of self-determination is absolute and the only thing spain can do it send in the army to prevent people to vote , but at that point the eu would be forced to act .
[non-native] the society present `` today '' is possible that have the necessity to change , or make more big their `` ground of action '' , if the people present inside are specialized only in a singolar sector , they ca n't help the society to modify itself .
[native] it 's actually only fair that foreign companies get to do business here too , which means sending profits overseas .
[native] there 's hundreds of years of legal precedent built-up in the common law which is simply not relevant when hearing cases related to quebec law , since it stems from an entirely separate legal heritage .

[native] that would explain increased corruption at provincial ( which of course madrid as a city-region lacks ) and local levels .
[non-native] so advertisements are a way for producers to sell their products by giving more to the consumers than only the product .

[native] galway may seem like just a big town now , but it has ~ 70,000 people living there and more people are moving in .
[non-native] i purchased the camera without doing some research online or trying it in the store .
[native] the reason immigrants integrate well into the us , is because they have a civic nationalism that encourages everyone to be proud of america .
[native] the whole point of isds is that there are intrinsic biases within the domestic government and court system against foreign investors , and hence why they need additional protection .
[native] what 's interesting to me is how such a major demographic shift occurred within the space of six years , because the territory expanded .
[native] funnily enough , parisians were hospitable to me than londoners were .
[native] i 've stated several times if ireland wanted to become a true technology hub it needs to embrace cheaper nuclear power as right now irish people pay stupidly high prices and proper investment in fiber optic infrastructure .

[non-native] all am saying that its better to specialize in on subject .
[native] looks like what happens here is echoed over at / r/russia .
[non-native] learning facts is also needed here to make the device complete without any problems which the people who had worked on the other devices before .
[non-native] the families these days , however , tend to have only one child , maybe two at the maximum .
[non-native] but young people do n't have to think about it .
[non-native] so i learned science and environment as well as economics .
[non-native] because only those people will be able to get so deep into the topic that they will eventually find new solutions to problems .
[non-native] in addition , a lot of the things mentioned in advertisements are incorrect .
[native] as i understand it , those whose families had been living there since before 1920 have citizenship , those that went there after the soviet occupation do n't .
[native] if you do n't mind me asking , which hostel are you at ?
[native] a referendum is a double edged sword for us though .
[non-native] otherwise understanding ideas offers a real and a pratical way to cheack if students gets completely the concepts they are learning that is definitly important as well .
[non-native] if you teach students only facts there is a high probability that they will feel bored .
[non-native] if we have knowledge about the other subjects we can analyze the problems more easily because we can search more subjects to solve the problem .
[native] at that stage , it was unquestionable that we would all fight for mother england and to protect the empire .
[native] hell the definition of who was white and who not was still fluid up until a few decades ago and even now is undergoing changes with how it 's being adapted to include ( or exclude ) people .
[non-native] this is just an example of how much publicity can influence people .
[non-native] there has already been talks of reducing this car gas by reducing the number of cars and using public transport instead .
[non-native] moreover , there maybe some students that handle these topics think about them and make some suggestions about them that can be fact in the future .
[non-native] an old couple retired from work will have lots of money for themselves from the retirement fund and the gratuity fund .
[non-native] several hundred years ago it was possible to study theology , astrology , astronomy and medicine and then claim to be a man having the whole knowledge of the whole world , being extensively educated in any known field of science .
[native] - edit : i do n't think you comprehend what happened during ww2 and the history directly after it .
[non-native] however , with some techniques , advertisement makes a product to seem much better than they really are .
[native] relaxing gun laws and advancing the right to bear arms with trained people 's militias intended to keep the government in check 14 .
[native] no , b. is simply `` one big country '' .
[non-native] however , the outcome was making me pretty upset becuase it did n't work even thoug the company has guarantee about the effects .
[non-native] further more , young people have more time and energy doing a thing than older peopole do , they do not afraid of failer and danger , they think they can conquer all the difficulties they faced and finally get to success .
[native] you 're never going to clear them all out , and it 's a waste of police resources how they 're currently going about it ( which is more a publicity stunt than anything else ) so just go business as usual .
[non-native] i 'm saying that , this i had the word from my private teacher which was `` your now a these days and the experience you had it in the really hard situation this wi ''as the technology advances , many young people enjoy the benefits like computer game , tv and so on .
[native] you can help understand how your leaders sold you out for vague promises from the west that never came .
[native] unfortunately the distribution of peoples and cultures is not in neat and symmetrical and equal pieces .
[non-native] these people can not even be a community member in the near future .
[non-native] at the end of your life you are supposed to be wiser and clever .
[native] getting any sort of detached property and a large section you need close to a million pounds .
[native] my post was going to be `` til immingham exists '' , or something equally snotty .
[native] it was the serbs who occupied northern albania , with no serbian population , in an attempt to gain an adriatic port during and after the first balkan war , an act opposed by the great powers , makes your ethical case incredibly difficult to argue .
[non-native] second , their daily schedules are much simpler are less task-oriented .
[native] but i suspect that the fdi advantages of being the * only * english-speaking country in the eu ( as opposed to just in the eurozone ) might well help us get over that - i see some uk companies are already sniffing around for hqs in ireland in case of a brexit .
[non-native] and second there is the student that always goes to class and take notes so that 's why when he has the exam he do n't need to spent so much time inm front of the book .
[native] your average canadian is pretty damn clueless about our war history unless they are super into the subject .
[native] my point about compromising was not a criticism of either side , just an obvious outcome if neither side is willing to compromise on something .
[native] you are right people love to get angry over stuff like this that they do not understand .
[native] seriously , you are just about the perfect country .
[non-native] from the tset time , the company really hope their custemers to know and to use their products .
[non-native] finally , trying new things is one of the most strong way to be successful .
[native] > yep , suing a sovereign country due to their own radiophobia .
[native] edit : given how wrong they are about homosexuality and judaism , how is it that you still subscribe to so many of their other theories ?
[native] but hey , [ since the separatists took total control here [ in donetsk ] , human rights and ukrainian activists say , an untold number of loyalists have been extorted , abducted , tortured and , allegedly , executed .
[non-native] he thinks about travelling abroad or going to beach .
[native] the political landscape is becoming very american-esque , a lot of right wing fringe groups popping up all the time .
[non-native] and you can check it with simple problems of the life for exemple , so if you consider that you know it because it 's simple , you wrong , all can be resume by ower experiences or facts of experiences of another one .
[non-native] so the fact to try new things and to take risks is not an insurance that our project will succeed .
[non-native] students for their knowledge need to understand the concepts and the ideas in order to answer the `` why '' question and understand why things work like this or like that andon the other hand they need to leran facts in order to understand better the ideas and concepts and especially that these usually are the conclusion of others works and most of them come from a passed period so you ca n't just ask the students to learn them if you can not prove them by real facts .
[non-native] it requires another learning background to understand how things have to be developed .
[non-native] also , it would be very cheap but safe if we travel with a lot of people .
[native] genuine question , not a snipe at the people of ni ( although a bit of one at the situation in stormont as i understand it )
[native] i never thought i 'd see a comment comparing a person to hitler while defending that person .
[non-native] it has become a necessity today because of the conveniances it adds to our life .
[native] of course , europe never died out when the black plague and the spanish flu both killed millions .
[native] yes , we were all just colonies of london , supplying cheap labour , food and quaint scenery for tourists from the city .
[native] a criminal is one who is convicted of a crime .
[non-native] on the face of it , the price of oil is rocketing which makes cars expensive to use .
[native] we do n't want a `` ban '' , we want to reduce the numbers of eu migrants coming to the uk , but of course , it would have to work both ways , and it would be up to each nation state to decide how they 'd react , not the eu as a whole .
[native] but not one person can rub two brain cells together and maybe think for 5 seconds and form a thought that is n't recycling the same old tired bullshit without proof .
[native] we only spend , what , 0.5 % of our gdp on military ?
[native] there 's a reason why putin is trying to rope in ukraine ... he 's desperate .
[non-native] this essay will explain why successful people took risks and tried new things .
[non-native] both the young and the old people enjoy life .
[non-native] so is not better product or worst if that bring and advertismenet but , make more value if thatt cause and effect like do not drink or smok , because can cause serios problems , and the people really dont buy it because they know the consecuences because the advertisement said .
[native] i know it 's not a realistic scenario or whatever .
[non-native] also , the tour guide might provide me lot of information about any touristic site , while i can not get these information from any other sources during the trip .
[non-native] i do believe that the ability to take rational risks is very valuable , but otherwise it is more easy to be the better one doing something if you already are doing this particular things .the success depend on what people try .
[native] having the ability to establish contracts in countries like germany or the uk makes everyone better off .
[non-native] consequently , we might conclude that to achieve this goal , it is smarter to find a domaine of expertise and stick to it , in order to become a well-known doctor , lawyer or scientist and benefit from it in terms od social status and financial advantages .
[native] still , britan is just playing politics with eu law ( again ) .
[native] petro has played every single political side in ukraine when it best suited his needs .
[native] diplomats are given their status because it is a necessity for countries to maintain communication .
[native] we feel like europe , but we 're not europe .
[non-native] but in the other hand , if the student had learn the fact that colors could be mixed , like red with blue give the result of purple , we identify that the person will have the idea and absollutly the knowlegde of every color , but he did n't understand the real meaning of the objective of the class .
[non-native] therefore , i agree with the opinion that young people nowadays do not give enought time to helping their communities .
[non-native] most advertisements definately make peoducts seem much better than they really are .
[native] eventually they gave up , government started anti-pollution work , and almost no real people believe the aforementioned `` right to pollute '' .
[native] that may not happen for another while ( if ever ) but in the meantime , uk should accept euro where possible to cater for those that do n't wish to use sterling .
[non-native] also , it is wrong to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because i will not have enough time to do all my works accuretly .
[native] that 's a lot more than the few million that read tabloids .
[native] billions have been used and set aside for the purchase of new equipment .
[non-native] so , they are couting something on a genuine food when he want to take a picture .
[non-native] technology process has made a lot of things to play .
[native] but i ca n't quit the job , because i need money and nobody wants to employ me as a songwriter .
[non-native] the race begins in the early years of life as rich sudanese oil/sheiks send their kids to school in shanghai , to attain an education fit to collide with the red blanket covering african/oil fields .
[non-native] so it 's not essentially true that people who took chances earlier are only successful ones , but there are people who were unable to achieve what they desired despite of taking risks .
[native] what you need is legacy services you can blame on the previous guy and then keep those running and if anyone asks there is no budget for new systems because there probably is n't anyway .
[native] culturally and ethnically maltese are closest to italians ( sicilians ) despite the language .
[native] i wonder what it would have been like to tell someone in victorian england that you are from cockshot or shingaycum wendy while keeping a straight face .
[native] 7 million will get you a decent mansion in london too .
[non-native] first , many advertisment companies make products much better than they really are in order to increase their profits .
[non-native] in my opinion , there are some basic reasons for that .
[native] because it only happened in like a dozen restaurants tops and was universally maligned as a petty idea .
[native] but i still think the boat city , ÅÃ³dÅº , has the biggest challenge to build international name recognition because the pronunciation is not at all what foreigners expect ( ` lawds ' ) , so different that they get totally confused .
[native] seriously tho this is a nice design considering its soviet , as opposed to the boxes that look the same .
[non-native] if there are no facts , ideas and concepts can not be born .
[native] just because the scale is linear does n't mean it has no variations or that multiple kinds of people can not sit on it .
[non-native] when somebody drives a car he 's totally dependant on the oil company 's will .
[native] - ireland has outstanding corporate tax rates , legal system and so forth .
[non-native] in my opinion , in general there is that idea that young people enjoy life more because they do not reponse or comply to certain parameters or rules that society has constructed over us .
[native] dutch people , cheapskates :p . as an aussie , i 've never seen anyone take issue with this .
[non-native] sometimes even by making up the fact that really does n't refer to the actual product , they compeat with other companies to sell more of their products than other 's .
[non-native] in a group tour , it is very difficult to satisfy the wishes of every member in the group .
[non-native] knowing that there is no guidline for success and there is only achieving content after effort will bring about instant glory to any man or woman .
[native] ** edit ** i should also say that given the border we share with them and that they are one of our main trade partners , we 'd definitely feel the impact of britain leaving .
[non-native] but after graduated from university , young businessperson must work from early in the morning till midnight in japan .
[native] `` we do n't want foreign people coming here and stealing jobs '' , ignoring people like me who plan to go abroad , or kirsten farage , and `` immigrants ruin everything , they do n't integrate and make life shit for the local people '' whilst sat on the costa del sol reading the daily mail with a fry-up .
[native] i do n't mean to be rude , but if you do n't know what the fuck you 're talking about then do n't make shit up .
[non-native] but i would like to consider this intriguing question by looking at the development of my person enjoyment of life .
[native] and that 's nothing compared to the kind of shit i heard whilst living in more homogeneous countries , like poland .
[native] the uk seems to be attempting to weaken the eu by luring member states into their domestic political debates .
[non-native] when i got into my speciality i realized again that it was practically imposible to have a very strong knowledge about all the field of neurology , first because it is a very vast part of the medicine , and second because it is changing practically in a daily basis , and being current with all the information is a quite difficult task .
[native] just do n't expect everyone to jump when you shout .
[non-native] therefore , i will not buy any wrong ththis philosophic question , to know who is enjoying the more life between young and old people , is a current one .
[non-native] in general , old people has a lot of money to spend compared with young poeple especially those still studing in high school or university .
[non-native] such as young people have less experiences of the society and world surrounding them , to them .
[native] enda may not look like much , but his skills with a brush are unmatched .
[non-native] ideas are back bone for the developing new concepts to trace the facts .
[non-native] today many governments and ngos begin to attack pollution caused from car usage . .
[native] america has been at war to long we are tired of it .
[non-native] i think , i agree this statement , because , i believe that proverb `` when you sow , and if you reap '' this provers is the true .
[native] the daily mail so the onion would be a better source .
[non-native] that is the way that we should educate our students .
[non-native] so everybody tries to get relaxed from that and want to get some kind of feeling of rest .
[non-native] so , i agree with the statment for two resones .
[non-native] for example every one knows about law of conservatiopn of energy , a person who understands applied in form of electricity or mechaniocal engine .
[non-native] i hope than in twenty years few cars will still work on oil .
[native] not that ireland or the uk are in any threat of being invaded ... but it does seem to me ireland is really banking on the uk stepping in and defending them if anything were to go to shit .
[non-native] it does not mean trying out risky acts such as driving a bike at high speed or keeping your both hands free , which younger generation find the idea of real fun .
[native] of course it represents the oppression of a race of people and i never claimed otherwise .
[native] there are roughly 500,000 people working in financial services in the city .
[non-native] for example , it would be quite impossible to study litterature or better history just trying to remember al the facts by heart .
[native] i am not saying justice should be compromised for the sake of her cultural belief .
[native] there is only two types of land : russian and temporarily non-russian land .
[non-native] sometimes there is no logical princip for me which i can follow .
[non-native] first , to have a vast knowledge of many subjects , one needs to devote time for all for them , proportinally .
[native] i do n't think it 's so much that as it was [ paul bremer ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paul_bremer ) being a incompetent fuckwit who based his decisions more on righteous ideology than realistic practicality .
[non-native] they tend to have more patience , and have hobbies such as model-building and collecting things from their youth , and they tend to play games like golf and chess , and they remember past experiences .pollution is the majorfactor now a days .
[non-native] hence they are much prefer to do them instead of helping comunties .
[native] / u/jrohila is someone that starts frothing at the mouth whenever immigrants or muslims are mentioned , so this response is unsurprising .
[non-native] but even in such cases one will surely engage oneself in some activity that he/she might eventually end up enjoying a lot .
[native] and as a result , you 're amazing conversationalists .
[native] i 've found that since moving to the uk , people treat anything except the general election ( eu votes etc ) as being irrelevant and not worth showing up for .
[native] that 's why engineers hire marketing and sales people to grow their startup .
[native] see for example i find your argument circular , as follows : - you are arguing that people who want there to be limits on immigration are xenophobic .
[non-native] first , the understanding of the basic concepts of the topic that he 's studying .

[non-native] it helps me learn alot when they were given to me and preparing to answer that i choose this because it is best to find out more than hesitating to answer it .i agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
[non-native] for example , a very successful company of cell communication , which is faced to a new one whose prices are more availabable than hers must take risks by cutting down her prices in order to have more profits .

[non-native] in google , there 's no special rights for anyone in the company .

[native] it 's called looking at an issue objectively without thinking its a video game and the team with the most kills is the winner or loser .

[non-native] to utterly comprehend the everyday life of young people and the prodigious amount of stress and challenges a young person faces today , one must view the world through the eyes of a young person :

[non-native] when u get older the taste that u get from life chances .
[native] it is amazing how the government and the media managed to brainwash its people .
[non-native] since the cities are growing constantly and funds of governments and local administration can not grow as rapidly as cities , it becomes harder to travel within the city using the overcrowded mass transit systems .
[non-native] since the definition of student is coming fro the verb '' to study '' i think it wo n't be a great deal to make them learn the practice before they know how to apply the practice itself , it could result a mere misuse and no more .
[non-native] indeed how could life be characterized to enable us to affirm that young people more enjoy it than older do .
[native] but on that note , let 's not forget about the last century .
[non-native] these cars are also cheaper to mantain and more reliable .

[non-native] the new technology has been developted and will be in very high speed and in very varied way that people use the cars more in their life .

[non-native] from the early stone age we are understanding the concepts rather than knowing , for example we came to know about fire , by rubing two stones together thus unerstanding the process of fricton by using stones .

[native] up north there are still issues , parades being the most obvious , the violence is less ideological and more a case of criminal gangs who organise themselves along the old sectarian divide .
[non-native] but as a visionary i completely believe in it and i whole heartedly support the statement .
[non-native] for example , few weeks ago i saw a digital camera ad on fry 's electronics that was offering a great discount on this featuring model .
[native] i 'm not saying putin isnt turning a blind eye , but to think he is singing papers that give weapons to separatists requires proof beyond `` hes in charge of russia '' .
[native] so , endorsing ttip means endorsing a very radical stripping of the public interest into a tiered society where compassion is deliberately framed as bad .
[native] canada had some very lax immigration policies under the liberal governments , and thankfully our current government , for all the crap they have done , have made sure to strengthen and make it more difficult to immigrate here .
[non-native] lao zi , a chinese psychologist , once said : there have a teacher in any three persons .
[native] how much soverenty would we be giving up to the eu commission ?
[native] where else would the casualties from ~ ~ kuwait ~ ~ ~ ~ iraq ~ ~ afghanistan go through ?
[non-native] another person named mc milan who invented cycle could not have invented it unless he tried several times .
[native] > the ** purpose ** of the ttip is to bring european standards down to the level of us ones this is not a display of weasel words , this is you probably reading too fast to notice the key word .
[native] nationalism and ethnic identity are the antithesis of leftwing politics .
[native] in some ways it is probably the cultural thread that unites europe .
[non-native] i believe the use of cars will never decrease .
[non-native] to explore these new places young have lots of energy and enjoyment by exploring that places .
[non-native] to be able to compete with other firms and stay in the market , companies spend unbelievable amounts of money in advertisements and show their products as the ` best ' product that is in sale .
[native] most likely they 're suing for expropriation without compensation , as well as a host of other clauses of the energy charter treaty that germany persumably violated in their shut down .
[native] i guess most black metal bands mainly criticise christianity so people notice when they criticise islam instead .
[native] youth unemployment : greece , ( 56 % ) , italy ( 44 % ) , spain ( 56 % ) , france ( 25 % ) .
[non-native] it is the basic step to get upper level .
[native] it 's before the ecj at the moment on whether the deal is a mixed competence , or purely eu competence .
[non-native] i agree that people should try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
[native] this serves to confuse policy making in a weak state .
[non-native] the companies make big investments either on research and development or their workers and they think that it is their right to gain economical benefit out of this by means of advertisements .
[non-native] in my opinion , however , i agree that successful people try new things and take risks because new things can stronly appeal to people , they are different from other things , and it is hard to be on the top with the same things .
[native] it is a capitalist state with a very large public sector .
[native] interestingly , in the scotland independence debate , the `` yes '' campaign used the ireland loan as an example of why the ruk would bail out iscotland / iscotland 's banks if need be and there was probably some truth to that argument .
[non-native] for a very long time , mankind has not taken care of the environmental health and state .
[non-native] i have to care to help myself and my family .
[non-native] it is good for a person 's mind , also living in modern society .
[native] but it 'll be like a wave that 's moved on from the richest countries , to the next tier of countries , to the next , etc. . . one day , probably a very long time after you and i have departed this earth , it 'll reach countries like saudi arabia , uganda , and the like .
[native] until you go to london , you have no idea of the meaning of `` tiny and overpriced '' [ there are some fine examples here ] ( http://www.worstroom.com/ ) .
[non-native] with all the broad knowledge of many academic subjects we are studying , it 's been experimented that we only use 1 % of our brain .
[native] your post might be better received if you did n't speak in such hyperbole , or at least gave substantive arguments to what you claim .
[non-native] when i travel by myself , i have to clear these steps .
[non-native] furthermore , i give an example about my job .
[native] ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/minister-with-russian-ethnicity-says-estonians-still-united-a-963003.html ) should we worry about it next week ?

[non-native] by the way i considered the advertising spaces a lost of time and i do n't listen them because , according to me , they are all make to seem what they are n't .
[native] ah yes , the ones who do n't know a word of spanish , sitting on their terraces in benidorm , eating fried breakfast or something disgusting with chips , watching the premier league , drinking carling , reading the daily mail , and spending their days talking about how the uk has gone to shit because of immigrants who refuse to integrate , and their love of ukip .
[native] trying to break the circlejerk invites the bot moderators , and ironically starts flame wars with everybody against you .
[native] claiming such a limitation is ` flippant ' seems to be lacking in an appreciation for context .
[non-native] so to avoide this problem , the companies will not make products seem much better than they really are .
[non-native] carpe diem , enjoy the instant , was their lema , their solution , the only way of being able to have a happy ancianity is to have lived a happy youth , because you never know whats going to happen with you tomorrow .
[non-native] but is that really the best way , only doing what you already know how to do well ?
[native] but certainly not in romania or bulgaria or even poland .
[native] the data seems to indicate that there has been a massive increase in the last few years , rather than just a bit more .
[native] > numbered bank accounts are not anonymous neither is reddit , luca
[native] seems like you have no idea what you are talking about .
[native] the us is n't threatened by latin america , there 's no reason to do it .
[native] one theory is that romanian is descended from proto-albanian or some other ( related ? )
[native] i 'm more into edam , brie + feta tbh
[non-native] it will be give you the qualification of expert on the matter .
[non-native] i believe that having your own opinions is the most important thing .

[native] work to live , do n't live to work , foreign competition makes it much harder in that specific sector .
[non-native] but he himself got the post and got the opportunity to do something for the community , he just declined the job for a more lucrative job offer abroad .
[non-native] the other reason is a little bit more practical than the first one .
[non-native] in my community , it is really common to see a great many old people walking with their grand or great-grand children , smile on their face .
[native] in my small town we have a tuck shop and it sells everything from cleaning products , food , snacks , cheese ( big fucking win right there ) , football jerseys and flags , christmas gifts and importantly dr.who stuff .
[non-native] also he will choose the best plases to vesit .
[native] the first thing they 'll think is ` who 's paying them to be here , and what is their mission .
[non-native] and this is specially true in the case of usa , where a person has nothing to do without a car .
[non-native] today there are no `` universal genius '' anymore .
[non-native] at this point i decided that it would have been a wast of money buying it and i left the shop .
[native] for the refugees to get to egypt , they 'd have to either cross israel/palestine ( good luck ) , or fine a boat that 's heading to egypt - as if there 's that much two-way cargo between the two countries .
[native] > also , imagine if the target where any other faith , say judaism or islam .
[native] i have met americans who move to canada and are shocked at our maps that we use in schools , you know not making us the centre of the world lol

[non-native] therefore , learning is not always helping students understand .
[non-native] they are forced to use cars , because they have a lot of things to carry .
[non-native] indeed , the technological breakthough with h.ford and the ford t provided the idea that each people would have a car .
[native] it will be really interesting - if its hard rock , and it looks like it is , is it a piece of a planet ?
[native] i will still be likely making a break for it , though .
[non-native] young people say this statemet only from the vidual parts .
[non-native] really sounds as if we are asked that will we have to leave our daily necessity ?
[native] of course you 'd say this , upon noticing that germany polled so close to usa .
[non-native] it is proven that most of the enjoyable things to do are considered rong and imature .
[non-native] in that respect , our society are prouded of these behaviours of sorts .
[native] this is not so in korea , for example .
[non-native] it 's easy to talk someone into buying something by mentioning the great , exsacurated sides of a product .

[non-native] but this is related about being pessimistic or obtimistic .
[non-native] it was still scary to go there by self .
[non-native] after finishing thier studies , it will be easier for specialised person to choose his path .

[native] you 're glad he asked , but still give no answer .
[native] price stability means protection against deflation as well as inflation .
[non-native] in addition , the company should advertise the products nicer and i think this is a part of their job .
[native] i think you may be a truly unique snowflake .
[non-native] we will have to depend on alternate methods of energy to run our automobiles and other equipments .
[non-native] we wouldn not know how to communicate with local people , how to buy things and even get the food we want .
[native] i bet you hate that you ca n't fly back to ireland in irish made airplanes like in the golden age .
[native] did you know portuguese is lexically the closest non-celtic language to irish ?

[native] some are genuine arseholes , and they 're easy to spot , some just have experience .
[non-native] they first think about themselves , their family and their friends , not the people who are not related to them .
[non-native] for example take our indian culture , we can tell the students that out culture is this and we must be in such a manner who our beloved neighbour and the past people will be living .
[non-native] to resume my point of view in few world : if i can propely understand the concept and the idea of what i 'm learning i will be able even to elaborate them and to use it even in different suituation .
[native] my opinion is that this is how representative democracy is suppose to work : the battle of ideologies to take place in parliament where the laws are written , not in courts where they are interpreted .
[non-native] for example , in germany , every individual had to serve in the army for a minimum of two years .
[non-native] i am still young and can only imagine how the lives of old people .
[native] it also shows that they are mostly not part-time .
[native] i 've also never heard anyone claim that trade unions and consumer organizations having a big interest in ttip happening , so at least we have a first there as well .
[non-native] but not for all the people , things are clear . ..
[non-native] they have the power and improved mind that can help them to do more and more fun .
[non-native] one must be openminded and at the same time conserved so as not to lose ones culture in this earthly swirl .
[non-native] it is those who invent themselves and push forward with their actions who are successful no matter what the situation is .
[non-native] this privatization of entertainment and of life in general means that young people seem much less concerned about their direct community and are more focused on themselves .
[native] which is the reason i agree with it in theory , but suspect it is impossible in practice .
[non-native] according to a survey conducted by the statistic bureau of shanghai , there will be only 1.2 % of the whole population who want to purchase cars in the next 5 years , which means the demand for cars almost achieves a saturation .
[non-native] environmental pollution is another reason to decrease usage of cars in future .

[native] putin placed his own sanction on goods from europe , forcing russians to do without or to seek russian made products , which will take time for such commerce to catch up .
[native] but the actual details of the case have n't been released to the public so we simply do n't know how much of a ` common sense ' ground vattenfall is suing by .

[native] i do n't remember reading any debunking as such .
[native] they had to ratify it for it to go into force .
[native] yes , but you also want to limit certain groups being able to lobby .

[non-native] they usually get less time to serve for their community .
[native] i do n't think that the impressions that we are getting in the news in western europe about what 's going on in ukraine are 100 % clear and that there 's obviously more to the story .
[non-native] older people have gone through or have had the opportunity of going through everything live had offered to them , have made their choices and now can look over their shoulders and smile or not .
[non-native] an ordinary woman watches this commercial and can not stop herselt to buy a x in order to make her eyes as beasutiful as the model 's .
[native] i just feel bad for skane - the love child of denmark and sweden that neither of them acknowledge , nor want .
[native] so while the president can form & negotiate one , the senate needs to approve it .
[native] mossad have been caught using fake nz , australian , canadian and uk passports too .
[native] > since you 're rich enough you can exploit her misery and pay her to have exclusive rights over the child .
[native] i would be astonished if schulz , juncker or verhofstadt came to the uk to campaign to keep the uk in the eu .
[non-native] from the stand point of this conception human should be well-educated , namely he should attend different courses or academic subject .
[native] this is an actual case , and is what happened when ethyl corporation sued the canadian government through isds provisions in nafta .
[native] we 're a nation of 300 million with a lot of idiots , some of them make it abroad , sorry .
[non-native] from what have been talked above , we may safely draw a conclusion that young people enjoy life more than older people do .in my opinion young peole do n't enjoy themselves then older people do because we speak of two distinguisced way to enjoy .
[native] all the best hard cheese styles are from the netherlands .
[non-native] this proves that a medical doctor today can not accumulate the same level of knowledge in many medical subjects and reach a comparable level of perfection as one could thirty years ago .

[native] vattenfall is acting within the bounds of the law , there 's no need for you to apologize .
[native] if someone shows up and wo n't tell you where they are from , and ca n't show you where they are from , what are we to do ?
[native] edit : note that this is what we do on our homeland .
[native] no , but some people might get confused between the tpp and the ttip .
[non-native] as result of the misleading of many advertisements , we can read in the same newspapers , an increase of the number of law suits .
[native] i do n't think there should be a distinction between foreign and domestic companies , they should both be able to sue the government when they do wrong .
[native] you 're mistaken , it 's absolutely based on law and anyone that 's ever read through isds submissions will tell you that .
[non-native] as a consequence , it would not let the person to stay behind the era that he lives .i totally agree with the statement that ` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . '
[non-native] quoting names of few people hailing from different regions of society and from different disciplines but successful in there deeds - mahatma gandhi , elbert einstein , wright brothers , henry ford , bill gates , sachin tendulkar , michael schumacher .
[non-native] this may be because they might be unable to find the time for their communites or may be they might be busy with some important schedules , which they have to definitely attend to .
[non-native] who cares about young people who care about who ?here the topic is about whether to have broad knowledge in many academics subjects is better or in one specific subject is better .
[non-native] this if a good example to show that there are old people that do not enjoy themselves , and to support the idea that the peak of a lifetime is when being young .
[non-native] yes , that probably will happen , but still we will probably like to have our own car in the garage to use it during the weekends .
[non-native] the main goal of school is to well-train young generation in order for them to adapt and improve our fast progress society .
[native] ntbs [ non-tariff barriers ] and mere regulatory heterogeneity create ` trade costs ' for market access , both ways , but it is exceedingly hard to assess authoritatively what the trade costs are , and what consequences they have , whether for goods or services .

[native] in a decade , i ca n't see russia being anything other than a country with an economy on par with moldova 's ( while the former communist eu countries like poland and slovakia and the rest of the world continue to rise ) , its already sickly demographics fleeing to the likes of china , germany , and canada .
[native] threatening to leave the eu and using that as a negotiating tool is never going to work , because those elected/nominated will act in the interests of the body they were elected to .
[native] so in the end , it basically needs a one-party-state , and conditions required to democratically elect and maintain a one-party-state .
[native] i 'm a european first , a celt second a brit third .

[native] > hear a lot of complaining but no solution .
[native] it 's the same process that has the descendants of black africans speaking an indo-european language in the usa , and indigenous americans speaking another ie language in brazil .
[native] ( actually , could be a stealthy way to start a take-over ... )

[native] you think that democracy is a good way of determining those that are and are n't competent ?
[non-native] first , having broad knowledge allows us to work more effectively in business .
[native] do n't you think it 's the people who * should * be making the decision ?
[non-native] secondly , in order to persuade the customers that they have the best product presented in the market , these firms invest much money on the production of an ad .
[non-native] if this is also called a way to enjoy life , then the little kids express their enjoyable by enjoy playing .
[native] yeah i work with someone who immigrated from cyprus .

[native] unless you are also into not letting anyone divorce unless their spouse agrees , or anyone quit their job unless employer agrees .

[native] getting rid of your citizenship is indeed quite difficult .
[native] on the other hand , why not recognise these areas as cultural identities and let each fly their new flag .
[non-native] nevertheless , i do not think that being led by a guide is necessarily a bad choice ; a tour guide can show us places that we would never had found by oureselves , especially if the guide comes from the country we are visiting .
[native] there does seem to be a big disconnect between the facts and how immigration from the rest of the eu is perceived .
[non-native] probably they do something for their commnunity , but will not give enough time to do that .

[native] do you think jobbik will gain more support from fidesz recent unpopularity ?
[non-native] advertisements are to help the company to commercial their own products to people , to make better profits out of it for themselves .
[native] in new zealand our welfare system is pretty good .
[non-native] just as what i presented above , they surf on lin and take some risk activities to relax themselves and then go back to work .
[native] generally no , but ` unemployment ' , ` food stamps ' , and ` welfare ' all have job search requirements .
[native] i 'm not recalling it well but i heard it from someone who 's in the irish army who 's usually well informed on these things .
[native] i know that he would n't even be let into the house of commons today , if he still had the same stance on colonialism .
[native] it seems like the uk is holding the eu to ransom in an attempt to renegotiate treaties to the uks favor .

[native] except the us and the west have tactical nuclear weapons specifically for the purpose of changing the tide of battle and to deter opposition .
[non-native] they want to do many things that they were not able to do when they were younger .
[non-native] at that time on the tv , it shows the flying robot that i can control it and make it fly .
[non-native] at the same time , a very specialized worker like an electrical engineer will have an advantage when his skills are particularly requested in a particular sector .
[non-native] but anyway , my point of view is fewer cars would be a good and possible thing which would be likely to happen if each one of us are willing to make efforts to help our planet .i used to like to go travel and almost my travel was followed a tour guide .
[non-native] the inventor that i admire most is marie curie , who developed the x rays technology .
[native] but i guess that would require a sort of daughter ship . .

[native] for example , germany and france are in favour of specific financial transaction tax , which the uk is against .
[non-native] in conclusion , young people do not enjoy life more than older people do because we are all the same .
[native] separating from great britain would be quite a feat .
[native] interesting how we sometimes like to hear good things about our countries and do n't like to hear bad .
[native] as a british columbian , i highly doubt we would care , and if the * liberals * ( in bc `` liberals '' means conservatives and `` ndp '' means liberal ) in office did change it , i would welcome it because i think its fugly as hell .
[non-native] one reason is they can be praised their intelligence when theycan answer the question from other people .

[non-native] so i think that people should reduce to use some tools sach as cars .
[non-native] it is proven and i have read a survey oh how many people read information on the package of the soap if this kind of soap is dermatologically tested or not .
[non-native] but putting on to the real life this lead a big role .

[native] from a european country , definitely the [ reichstag ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/reichstag_building_berlin_view_from_west_before_sunset.jpg ) .

[native] i suppose it was a case of `` better the devil you know '' for them .
[non-native] as can be seen , getting older cut the links between you and the life .

[native] this is vintage eu : a grumpy outburst from voters leads to a strengthening of the status quo .
[non-native] this opens up a bunch of alternative possibilities to provide another means of transportation different from cars .

[non-native] this is putting the current generation under severe pressure .
[non-native] they are just showing the products , we dont know anything about the quality of these things .

[non-native] it means that you understand the general concept of a situation instead of a little step in the middle of it .

[non-native] so you can totally enjoy your travel without always worring about all kinds of situations .
[native] look at how much area the grounds of the white house waste though .
[native] you regulate money supply by adjusting the cash rate .
[non-native] third , colour can be an important component for a good result in the creation of an advertisement .
[non-native] like that , if company make customers belive , customers continue to buy products .
[non-native] usage of cars is not suspected to decrease because cars are the unique and cheap transportation vehicles in the world .i absolutely agree with the statement that , successful people try new thinghs and take risks .

[non-native] third , the quality of experience is greatly differd between young people and older people .
[non-native] for example if the student wanted to know the circumference of a pentagon then if the student only learned facts the he may have forgotten the equation , but if a student knew that circumference of any object was the total length of the sides then he can add the length of each side and get the answer .

[non-native] as above montioned there are two sides of this issue .
[native] no one is guilty until they 're deemed so .
[native] that 's why it 's best if the uk leaves .

[native] considering their birth rate , it should be a lot of kids .
[non-native] but alternative energy source will be invented also in the near future like hydrogen or solar energy , which is free from pollution .

[native] * an uninformed opinion has been corrected : regarding the uk * the number of people particpating in help to buy has been low at 5 % , and the interest rate being charged is also low - but funded by government debt which is also low , so not at the expense of the crown .
[native] if that was actually your point then your original post was extremely vague .
[non-native] they can concentrate on one specilaized one and can improve their knowledge in that subject my learning more about the specified subject .

[native] you may not like it , but this decision is supported by the german population .
[native] you seem a lot less hostile to the idea of differing opinions now , i hope you end up somewhere that fits in with your mindset .
[non-native] for this reason i believe that young people will enjoy their life more .
[non-native] an ad ca n't be liked by everybody , and sometimes ca n't be understood by anybody .
[native] then even in the general election in recent years , less than 70 % of people turn up .
[non-native] so my adventage is that always make sure the product you are buying it what you think it is , you can check with friends of yours that had bougth it , or with different stores that sale it , do not let the advertisement convince you .i will agree to the statement that `` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts '' .
[non-native] the world undergoes a goelogical cycle inorder to maintain the balance of nature .
[non-native] of course in twenty years the technology will grow rapidly even faster than we can imagin and that means more ways of transportation that may cancel the cars or make it a second way of transportation i really think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars for several reasons .

[non-native] i believe and agree that successful people are the ones who try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
[non-native] if we learned the concepts more effectively , we would done a great job in our applications such as in studies , business and in our department .
[native] more of a `` us is our rival world bully , here are some conspiracies it 's doing to try outbully us , and how we can learn from it to better bully our neighbors '' rather than `` us evil '' though .
[native] i do n't think europe is in a position to stop putin from taking that which he wants .
[non-native] i 'm studing in u.s. right now because i want to live better in future .
[native] also , it would be a governor general , with the lieutenant governor for all the sub-national regions , if need be .
[non-native] therefore , doing things you already know means to become more professionel on a specific task .
[non-native] this is my case , i have n't nearly a clue of i surely will be , or in which envoironment i would like to work in , maybe turism business ?
[native] publish a report on it that the masses can judge , then you 'll have something to stand by .

[native] well in new zealand they 're trying to negotiate a free trade agreement ( a simmilar agreement ; trans pacific partnership ) , and very little of it has to do with tariffs .

[native] on top of that , china 's relationships with the eu and the us are far more important than its relationship with russia due to the size of their economies and america 's military presence in asia .
[native] having thought about it for a while , you have changed my view .
[non-native] therefore agree young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .it is an increasingly busy life that we all , are leading today .
[non-native] to understand ideas and concept is more important than learning the facts .
[non-native] many reasons show that in twenty years the numbers of cars will increase .
[native] speaking of gas prices , if you buy gas - and you probably do - you * are * paying for those free roads .
[native] he thinks that eu expansion into eastern europe is american/western imperialism and that eu member-states are american satellite-states , he ca n't fathom the notion that eu member-states voluntarily joined the eu .
[non-native] i think that the young people have a lot of time for helping their communities but they do n't want help it .
[native] maybe if you did , you 'd understand why people act the way they do and understand that disgust or discomfort is something ingrained by society .
[native] rather , you 're always going to be governed by other voters and if you 're a british conservative you likely have more in common with a german or dutch conservative than you do with a british progressive .
[native] small chapters have been leaked , but these represent a minority of the whole text .

[native] > if you 're talking about genetics , the irish do have a distinctive makeup , as well as several diseases that are indigenous defects only found in irish populations .
[non-native] in conclusion , i agree with the statement that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academics subjects and the points made above sustain this thesis in a both personal and professional perspective .i disagree with the statement .
[non-native] in conclussion , the difference between learning and understanding really does n't matter in my opinion , the important point is that with both of them the student is learning even facts or ideas that he will use on the future maybe working or teaching other students .

[non-native] i disagree this because i am a young people who pay enough time to helping my communty .
[non-native] let me introduce yet another point to strengthen my argument .
[native] in other words , excepting feelings towards neighboring countries , and to a lesser extent foreign relations in general , chinese people 's opinions can not be swayed at the whims of a spin doctor .
[non-native] next , if young peppe contribute their communities , this city improve .
[non-native] in the most ads the dont mention the bad things in the product they just show to the people how is it in a good way .
[non-native] considering all of above reasons , most of people think it is better way to try things that i already know because they wanted to do well , but when it comes to me , i believe that people should try new things even thought there are a lot of dangeous risks and difficulties .
[non-native] by studying about one specilized subject one can grasp many ideas form that subject .
[non-native] secondly , helping communities is a rule that every day and every minutes should do .

[non-native] they just want to have it and ask their parents for this product as long as the parents decide to buy it .
[non-native] i will briefly present two reasons supporting my opinion .
[non-native] there are a lot of factors that make students understand ideas and concepts sometimes is eassier then learning facts .i am agree to the statment because i think too that the succesful people is the people who try new things and take risks , but i think that it is n't the only reason to say to this people succesful .

[native] ah now , we 're a grand size altogether .
[native] as far as i know the deal is not even finished with india as a contract has not been signed , and people in india are lobbying against it as they would prefer to see the government buy the tejas as soon as it becomes available instead of buying a `` foreign '' plane ''
[native] causing their factories to seize up and their citizens to freeze to death .
[non-native] without risk we can not do any thing great and we all people should do something new and find something new and contribute something to world .in a contemporary society , someone who is specialized in one specific subject is more competent , and is more needed than someone who has broad knowledge on general topics .
[non-native] they have to work for their family and themselves .
[native] hard to say , i know there are much fewer family 's able to get by with one wage-earner over two nowadays so maybe/perhaps things are worse but since i do n't have supporting figures i ca n't say .

[non-native] after getting the main points of a lesson , students learn the facts .
[non-native] secondly , the technology is totally related with the advertisements which make products seem much better .
[native] for all the national pride , i think most scots wo n't want a change .
[non-native] a secondary desired effect is to strengthen the image of the company and of the product .

[non-native] humans developed years together by understanding rather than knowing the fact
[non-native] world is developing people need to follow that other ways we can not developing more and more .
[non-native] if someone looks from this perspective it can easily be concluded that in the future we , even for basic humanity needs , will be using our cars .
[non-native] when compared to all the vehicles that are available now in the marked , the best transport that fits a family is car , which is affordable by a common man .
[non-native] furtermore , the young people often sake for some risk activities to colour their lives .

[non-native] personal cultur , academic and theoric knoledge and pratical experience .
[native] by prodding the defenses of nato , putin accomplishes two eminently important things , he `` maps '' the strategic capabilities of the threat while simultaneously cementing himself as the most uncompromised pro-russia russian in the political sphere , thus in turn making any critics of his actions into the image of western puppets .

[non-native] it is not the kind of thing will be changed in twenty years .when i see the commercials on television , i see many goods which look so facinating and useful .
[native] its not a bad place , its just unfortunate that there was a tv3 program about one of the shittiest estate
[non-native] ` 1 + 1 = 2 ' is just fact .
[non-native] another reason explaining that behaviour can , most probably , be found in the growing competition on consumer-goods markets .
[native] if you do n't like what the club 's rules are , you can try to change them or leave , but complaining about them when no one else shares your opinion is not constructive .
[native] the fact that rt had a russian bias does n't discount the fact that * every * news agency has a bias or two .

[native] the scots who settled in northern ireland ( and later became witch-burning americans ) were mainly extremist puritans from lowland scotland/northern england and were n't really a true representation of the entire cross-section of scottish society .
[non-native] this makes the product looks better by comparison with the environment it is presented in : people think if they get the product , their lives will be cleaner and easier .

[native] i have seen a lot of gender equality of line , but i mostly attribute it to living in a progressive side of the country .
[native] it would have been nice if 23powerz had included a '' / s '' , i imagine there are quite a few literal minded germans in here .
[native] credit cycles matter because they frequently prove so damaging .
[non-native] for time to come , i feel that with the current demands of industry and population , cars would be used more than they are being used currently .i disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
[native] also note : i 'm not trying to say that racism is not common in the us ( it is ) , i 'm not trying to say all europeans are racist ( they 're not ) .
[native] previously my view was the a ukip vote was a wasted vote .
[native] it 's very hard to prove intent without a lot of personal information from the couple .
[native] i agree , but to play devil 's advocate , palestine could also be doing a lot more to facilitate a peaceful solution .

[native] they pushed it too far and now the government has to host a referendum that they do n't want .

[native] [ neither the hittites nor the older or more marginal groups are usually placed in bithynia ] ( http://www.touregypt.net/images/stories/hittite3.jpg ) .

[native] i was going to say yeah , the wealth is there , but nobody needs a red plastic twice-lifesized buddha 's head .
[non-native] but leaving aside this problem , we can say that the general historical concepts , such as modernization , industrial revolution , etc. , help the historian in the collection and interpretation of the facts .
[native] `` before the class begins , you must get on your knees and worship haughey and accept that he was the greatest irishman the world has ever known , even greater than michael collins ! '' at this moment , a brave , pro-palestinian , fluent irish-speaking , eirigi champion stood up and asked , `` how much do you earn ?

'' the professor was visibly shaken , and dropped his chalk and copy of the ulster covenant .
[native] i really think it 's wrong for a woman to be wearing a burqa in the first place , but i also think that if a court is going to force a woman to reveal her face , the court should be cleared first .
[non-native] i still have no kids to take care of , but i really want to get married and have a lot of children , and i think i would continue enjoying life as i am right now as a young person .
[native] i do n't suppose those back taxes are worth about 125 % of our gdp ?
[non-native] however , i like to travel alone or with my own friends .
[non-native] the air pain was one of the suprising invention for himan beings .
[non-native] the good thing for young people is to help their communities .
[native] after all , politicians are there to serve the people , rather than the other way round .
[native] sign the fta with us germany , then we will buy all the weapons and military equipment you want to sell .
[non-native] though he is a successful person but he dont want to do what he already known .
[native] `` separatists '' does n't convey the purpose , or the means taken to reach them that these guys have deployed .
[native] it was n't a question of whether the british wanted to leave , it was a question of whether the rest of europe wanted the uk out of the eu .
[non-native] therefore , the number of cars in twenty years will be definitely less than the number of cars used today .i partiall agree with the statement that the young people enjoy life more than older people do .
[non-native] i rather spend same amount of money on eating well during my travel instead of hiring a tour guide .
[non-native] it does not decrease if you spread it to others .
[non-native] some of the companies that give the advertisements are not reliable .
[non-native] i 'm just saying that it is a behaviour i have observed .
[non-native] so be sure to kow a bit of everything and at the same time specialize in one specific subject .i agree to the statement that yound people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
[native] we both regard ourselves as `` celtic '' and at one point both ireland and scotland even spoke gaelic ( which is still spoken in some little outposts in scotland ) .
[native] they would cry but if it had the eu flag on it ...
[non-native] they do n't have to waste of time to investigate or ask to the others .
[native] i 'd rather see my / r/europe page as it is rather than with views i do n't like removed .
[non-native] though he had the knowledge of each and everything he was fooled to give up his soul just to know the knowledge of black magic .
[native] [ eyeballing it , i 'd say about 50 % are nicked !
[native] it was actually a matter of whether the uks price guarantee was illegal under the treaties governing the eu , but whatever .
[native] given that the brussels euro-elite rely on giant economies of scale to provide massive salaries and perks to themselves it would likely cause some consternation .
[native] secondly my point was that its pretty easy to hear about shitty news when the country has a shitty situation and vice versa .
[non-native] you might want to see around other places but since it is moving with group , you will not able to go by only your feelings .
[native] is n't that a bit dangerous for you to say ?
[native] our weather is really not that nice except in the upper north island .
[non-native] because of these facts the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
[native] the difference between the information a slovak and an american can get is virtually nil .
[non-native] after graduating , i has worked in osaka gas comapany .
[native] you 're just angry at me is all i can tell .
[native] i 've always heard belgrade called an ugly ( but still interesting ) city .
[non-native] for them he was already successful by doing what he learned and was trained to do .
[non-native] so i went to that restaurant with my friends on my birthday , i expected that free foods and many things .
[non-native] second , most advertisements use a lot of fancy method to attract consumers .
[non-native] even mul has consolidated its position by throwing out old indegenous players like hindustan motors or foreign players like fiat .
[native] they do have those cool churches that look like candyland
[non-native] advertisements are made to market a product and increase its sales .
[non-native] there are two reasons ; the prevention of the reallity and the conclution of the reliable relationship between retailers and customers .
[native] why should n't they be applying in the eu ?
[non-native] in this way , thier children will act the same way and there wo n't be any exampels of cooporation .
[non-native] it is just looks than young people enjoy life more than older do .
[native] i guess annexing neighboring countries and funding separatists isnt what it is cracked up to be .
[native] if the commissioners could be dismissed by parliament then maybe they would think twice before enacting harsh measures that cripple member states .
[native] so does the swastika , and you do n't see riot police walking around with that
[native] > you say this like there was n't a literally illegal coup in the country like weeks before .
[non-native] they are not prudent and ready to take risks which hopefully increases enjoyment .
[native] i 've never questioned peoples motives , and nowhere in here have i spouted ` generalized drivel ' .
[non-native] we would have still be sitting with candles in between us for lighting .
[non-native] personally , i think that it is more valuable to understand ideas and concepts .
[non-native] so they will be able to get more knowledge in there free time .
[non-native] the more we need the material to consume , the more advertised producs we face .
[non-native] the most adventage of that is first , time consuming to search and be satisfied with your goods .
[non-native] it is mainly due to the lack of culture and experience .
[non-native] first of all , yong people have a strong study ability to learn new things around them .
[native] plus i do not care if they are made by newborns , they are fucking delicious chocolate , one of the only chocolate i really enjoy , and after major holidays the grocery stores sell the jumbo bars they bought for next to nothing .
[native] on the other hand you have french guiana , ensuring the eu has land border with brazil .
[non-native] however , it is not always true because there are other factors could be borne in mind before appraching such a behavior by a lot of companies .
[non-native] in sum , if all the relevant factor are taken into account , we should n't overuse a car .
[native] that means that poland ** has ** to join eventually although their probably won ' y be any pressure to do so as long as the euro-crisis looms .
[native] this guy has been doing some epic trolling lately ...
[non-native] however , nowadays , things have changed a lot .
[native] the opposition would jump on this a chance to show that he has lost his cool and that the pressure of the job is getting to him .
[non-native] any little help given by young people helps the society to improve itself .
[native] you seem 100 % incapable of understanding this situation as an observer instead of an emotional little 17 year old kid .
[non-native] the children on the other hand are their to prove that the grown ups are more mature , the children do nothing but imature things wich they enjoy , but eventualy they are bownd to learn form the adults , who are more mature , that these enjoyalbe imature acitons are not permited and rong .
[non-native] and also there has been negative factor by technology .
[native] chinese wikipedia is surprisingly unbiased based on my reading , likely due to a swarm of enthusiastic taiwanese mods .
[non-native] but when you actually see the product at the shop , it is not that nice as you were expected and start to complaining .
[native] > belong to us winky face ah the chains of oppression ... sad face
[non-native] if on the advertisements , said negative things about a product , i assume that none of the people will be willing to buy the product .
[native] you are talking about the decision made by the german government on nuclear power , right ?
[native] even that video was `` muh tories '' , even though the council has no role in the effigies
[non-native] i must admit that i completely support it there are several reasons that support my opinion .
[non-native] for example thomas edison , bill gates and mark benz , all of them made their way to fame and fortune by doing things out side the box and using their natural talents .
[non-native] although we would be involved terrible trafic jams , public traffic such as trains and subways are usually be punctual .
[non-native] i used to get the top mark in mathematics every time .
[non-native] based on my personal experience , i strongly disagree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
[non-native] and it will probably countinue to be like that for a long time .
[native] link is to the german translated version for easier comparison with horst wessel lied .
[non-native] therefore , i would say that there is not a totally clear answer to the question , but the tendency in the later years of education for me is towards a specialization in one , maybe two subjects .i agree , i belive in a saying that states `` high risk equals high returns '' .
[non-native] we also can use bus or subway even the air plane but we always need a car when you try to go somewhere , even with your family .
[native] they were visibly * not * pro-russian and accused russia of meddling in ukraine .
[native] while i think the immigration scare is absolutely void of facts and is patently ridiculous , i consider people ignorant not racist .
[native] who knows what will happen if america has to fight something like that while simultaneously dealing with the same type of war in south china sea .
[non-native] and , there is no reason besides that to have a tour guide .
[non-native] moreover , i had to change all my trip , retiming my plane , cause of the other people .
[native] lowering tarriffs is one thing , telling another country how to spend it 's money ( subsidising research , a particular sector or wages ) and putting that in a free trade agreement is quite another .
[non-native] in conlusion , it strikes me that in twenty years there will be not fewer but more cars in use than there are today because of such reasons i have mentioned above .the probleme of the number of cars throughout the world is often debated when talking about polution .
[non-native] nevertheless , it is the young people who can work upon the stress levels much elegantly than an older person .
[native] > we would not have thought in a life time that on german streets people would chant primitive antisemitic invocations ( again ) .
[native] had the conservatives done something serious on this , i would have voted for them .
[non-native] the advertisements have a good razon for exist , when they make what are they made for .
[non-native] on the side , we also have university students who have to be taken under consideration .
[native] i go on that sometimes to help me aprende seu lingua .
[native] i think it 's silly to act as if their political spectrum is completely alien to your own .
[native] i have to say , one of the most magical moments driving up to it , seeing it gradually grow bigger and bigger , speckled with lights against a perfectly orange sky .
[non-native] why i agree with this point of view , and how do i feel about it ?
[non-native] to conclude i think in twenty years there will be fewer cars in cars than todaythere are many people that think that in better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , as the teacher , while other person think that is better to specialize in one specific subject .
[native] yeah , french nationalism was a top-down affair created by the state as it centralized , like the opposite of german nationalism which was a bottom-up affair of the bourgeois ( who were interested most in a common market ) and intellectuals who promoted a german identity over regional identity and allegiances ( and which bismark managed to co-opt brilliantly ) .
[non-native] second , there are many young people communicate witk others young people to try to help each others by them ideas for a reasult to help the communities .
[non-native] however , a group can never offer the sense of adventure and indepedence an individually organized trip can infuse you with .
[non-native] though he is 3 years old , he daose n't have a time to play with his friends .
[native] yeah , backing up an assertion with cynthia mckinney is not the best approach to it but what he 's saying has a grain of truth .
[non-native] so internet was inveted in so many days and the inventor never stopped , kept trying , worked hard and he used all the risks to get what he wants and what the people want to make their life better .
[native] i 'm proud to say i feel like i must have been adopted .
[non-native] as you can see , i rather buy my staff not paying attention at the advertisements , and i strongly recomend to get more knowledge about the staff that you are just going to buy .i agree with the statement that `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities '' because youngsters nowadays are being a lot of career conscious .
[non-native] my second point is that advertisements can do more than just showing a product at it 's best .
[non-native] it 's clear that people today day 's will do anything just to appear to others likeone has achieved all wanted goals and have reached fame and power .
[native] wow i am surprised to see the sukhois and pak fa on that list , i wonder if russia would still let you have them if finland decided to join nato or not .
[non-native] at that point , having a car will probably make more sense than ever .
[non-native] process will leads you to the result and you learn a lot of things through out the process .
[non-native] this kind of mentality is more current in the north of europe ( sweden , finland , ... ) .
[non-native] in other words , teaching facts about a subject in a class , not making students understand the vital parts of the concepts or ideas first , is just like saying the first word that must be kept until the end .
[non-native] an engineer can better think about mechanical things like machines , instruments etc , where as a doctor can have better idea of presentation of human body than an engineer has .
[native] ' '' * ----- `` a [ report by Ã¶fse , ] ( http://www.ttip2014.eu/blog-detail/blog/ofse%20study.html ) the austrian foundation for development research , released in april this year , analysed four reports on ttip [ ecorys ( 2009 ) , cepr ( 2013 ) , cepii ( 2013 ) and bertelsmann/ifo ( 2013 ) ] in an attempt to answer some of these issues .
[native] cost of living will rise like crazy , and plenty of people would be trapped .
[native] not all the town was remade in its pre-war image and some buildings could not be reconstructed .
[non-native] nobody can make a decision on behalf of the group .
[native] at least this sub recognizes and downvotes such specious arguments .
[non-native] in recent years , people 's academic level is emphasised , so that parents let their children go to cram school to get better the their childrens ' ability to enter the good school .
[non-native] there are of course many more examples , but those are rather dependant on the lifestyle and personal likes and dislikes people develope while getting older , than to the total amount of enjoyment they offer to differently aged groups .
[native] it 's easy to get tripped up when you 're asked questions that most people in europe know already .
[native] > i remember watching a british tv-drama of a nuclear attack on british islands and for couple of months i was terrified about the nuclear war .
[native] every eastern european country except for like belarus and east ukraine says that .
[native] no country will be economically strong enough nor stable enough to oppose them in soft power terms with the uk leaving , not the south , not france .
[native] a federal eu would still have the principal of subsidiarity , so if a given policy is best determined by local government , as opposed to federal , that 's where it would be undertaken .
[native] while some may view the eu idealistically , there are certainally realist arguments for sharing sovernty in a world with very powerful nations ; each of whom seek to assert their power to the benefit of their own national interests .
[non-native] moreover for the stock market they have to provide some information regularly to their share holders .
[non-native] but because you have to live with society , people must corperate with society .
[native] also the us dollar surging lately as the fed reserve looks to actually raise interest rates , possibly early next year .
[native] from my personal experience , i 've gotten along really well with lots of eastern europeans both abroad and in australia , but we do have a lot less of a cultural link .
[non-native] but there are more things we could see besides those sightseeing spots .
[non-native] so there is so much competition in academic and professional arena .
[non-native] in my belive that true but the god will help us if we work and do our best to get what we need or want in our lives .
[non-native] if a person does not have any information about a topic he or she can not say any thing about the topic .
[native] we get nothing at all but your mps can still vote on matters that only affect england .
[native] i ca n't believe russia would fight at all .
[native] well there is leeds city college which has a lot of people in it because it 's 6 colleges mashed together http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/leeds_city_college
[non-native] many people need cars for private voyage from their homes to their jobs or for their holidays .
[non-native] these technologies are already available today , but are not being used extensively for several reasons .
[native] i speak slovak but do n't know any polish .
[non-native] in addition , companies using advertisements tell people that how good their products are .
[non-native] there is a small example to support my answer , the are two student one is studying on it own means not attending the class but by hearting the sybluses and the other who is attending the class revesing only once .
[native] it was n't about tipping so much as how americans expect prompt service .
[native] lol , it 's funny how seriously the ex-ussr countries take eurovision .
[native] ( ii ) enabling a party to the marriage to obtain a right conferred by that law or those rules to reside in the united kingdom . ] ( http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/22/section/55/enacted ) .
[non-native] but before people deside to help someone , they often want to know at least some details about who is going to have an advantage .
[native] i ca n't get enough of the blonde woman 's face .
[non-native] if anyone is in dire need of a very rare group of blood , and if that person asks him for his blood he shall definitely donate his blood .
[native] just my opinion , but please continue down-voting on the basis of disagreement , it speaks volumes .
[non-native] firstly , successful people can employ better brains and skilled man power to help working on new things and exploring better avenues .
[native] the expulsion of a diplomat does n't need a crime to justify it - diplomats are * given * their status as a mark of respect .
[native] many people view the arguments against keeping the base open as mostly theoretical .
[native] i do n't accept that the treasury would not have informed him/his office that it was quite likely that it was likely that changes in gni would mean they would be required to pay a sizeable sum to the eu .
[non-native] that makes youth to enjoy life than older people .
[non-native] all of these are created and used by the youth for the first time .
[native] the twentieth anti-ttip article you 've posted on / r/europe in the last month ?
[native] but this is exactly how the far right get in .
[native] we also have the largest reserve of expeditionary forces & most expansive power projection capabilities on the planet to prevent that very type of thing from happening .
[non-native] for example , last year i traveled with my husband to california and we did not join a tour group led by a guide , we waste our time just for searching for places to go .
[non-native] here we see again that general physician 's varied knowledge allow him to better understand and diagonise the problem initially .
[non-native] these peoples do n't makes companies , because they follow the ideas of make only some money and start to work to people like bill gates , donald trump or google 's companies , people who make himself big because learn to facts .
[native] the point was to show that `` thats tit for tat '' is an absurd argument , in any situation .
[non-native] firstly , the country that you pick to travel which probably is the country that you wants to go the most uring that time .
[non-native] the situation determines if continuing doing things you know is the better way or if trying new ways leeds to more success .
[non-native] a successful pianist is one of the most revered musicians and plays the piano more accurately , at the same time gracefully , than others .
[non-native] in addition to this , facts are real things which make us more intelligent and add us extra knowledge .
[native] my point is that this conflict is , in fact , `` serious '' .
[native] i am so sorry you had to experience such stupid bigotry in this country .
[non-native] the idea of making 500 miles for only 2 dollars sounds definitely very appealing .
[non-native] i also think that one of the most important thing for successful people is to enlarge and extend as much as they can do their business in order to get more money , of course , we all know that `` money makes the world go around '' , but also for a feeling of desiring power !
[non-native] from this arrengement in a conclusion , today most advertiments we see represent the better version of the product and there are still people who buys these product before searching the products really quality .
[native] annexation , which is categorically illegal under international law , is when foreign presence becomes permanent .
[native] reagan started the trickle down economics thing before the soviet union ever fell .
[non-native] the pressure from the society and parents make them introvert and selfish .
[non-native] the high level expectations of youngsters out of themselves make them study and work harder .
[native] the millions left in the tel aviv area are targeted by chemical and biological weapons , in addition to an artillery barrage that makes the city look like rotterdam in wwii .
[non-native] i had to make that choice and concentrate because both areas are vast and i can have enough time only for one of them to learn and master it .
[native] too much of a liberal , pro-russia bent to it .
[native] if you 're living of food stamps and are lucky enough to get a house , then you can rest easy , if not then tough luck ?
[non-native] therefore i do not agree with the statement as stated above .no , i disagree , that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academics subjects than to specialize in one subject
[native] if you have great drinks but terrible service , people wo n't come .
[non-native] it would be an uncalculated risk and one is bound to fail .
[non-native] i believe that a person should specialize in a specific field and then excel in that specific field .
[native] australia , at least , does n't have a history of using blackface in theatre/cinema in a similar fashion , so there 's no reason to associate blackface with some racism element .
[native] the even bigger reason is because those identities melded into ` white ' awhile ago , whereas the white/black divide is still a very real thing in the us .
[native] it does have it 's time and place , but it must be used properly .
[non-native] it is obvious that student studing by learning the fact may be more effective as they can get the general idea from the fact .
[non-native] first , young people have healthier bodies than older people do .
[non-native] it is then one must set out to self discovery and risk .i agree to the statement .
[non-native] to excute this plan , i need to ask people who live there , and i need to try it .
[native] if the anglosphere created a proper political , economic and military union it 'd shit all over anything russia , china and anyone else could muster .
[non-native] so , they have to understand every facts and they have to improve the skills by calculating and producing the concepts .
[native] proper filter brew or hand-press with freshly ground beans is the only way to go for me .
[native] people have to understand the developed countries see themselves as needing leverage with the developing countries they do not have now .
[non-native] but there are parents who always say to their children there is only one thing they have to care about , that 's study and get to the prestigious university .
[native] http://greece.greekreporter.com/2014/03/25/common-words-in-the-greek-and-turkish-language/ edit : and do n't read the comments section , dear god ...
[native] i also remember watching the seoul olympics on tv and being strongly aware of the part that sport played in the cold war .
[non-native] given the present trends , and the efforts made by research institutes and car manufacturers , i believe that number of cars on roads will only increase as the years pass by .i do not agree with the statement `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' .
[native] female genital mutilation is more akin to cutting the head off the penis , than the foreskin .
[native] you mean places in their own country turned to shit by immigration ?
[native] they just demonstrate that someone is wrong or misinformed .
[native] it was more the russian empire then the soviet union .
[native] essentially the reduced flexibility of union offsets the benefits of a giant market ( e.g.
[non-native] so my conclusion is , we know it is not really true but we can just go and have fun there .i do n't support the idea that is better to have broad knowledge than to specialize in a specific subject .
[non-native] finally in my opinion we shoud have a basic knowledge , a basic preparation on many academic subject , and then we shoud have a specific area of knowledge to spend better on the `` world of work '' .successful people use to take risk in the projects that they are involved in .
[non-native] current society is not community-centered any more but each home-centered .
[native] of course this would make any chance of ukraine remaining a united , cohesive entity being dead in the water .
[native] the only news that would come out of a filtered rt is the weather .
[native] i do n't see how you reach the conclusion that it 's insanity , when it 's exactly what every civilization has been doing since the time immemorial .
[non-native] the reason being there are defined and speculative ways for ganing wealth and fame or making pots of money .
[non-native] with the broad knowledge it can have most global culture than specific knowledge .
[native] boeing is also working on the advanced super hornet , a further development of the f-18 that incorporates stealth features .
[non-native] you generally go to the one who is known as the best specialist .
[native] the british have a sense of humour ; if they ask where you 're from , just tell them latvia .
[native] > they are regions of the same country , ireland .
[non-native] sometimes subway is much faster than driving a car without being tired .
[non-native] else , why would everyone want to retain youth forever or why no one in this world ever wants to get older ?did you go the most famous market in taiwan ?
[native] that might be a bit excessively punitive ... kaliningrad maybe , but the core russian territory probably should n't be split .
[non-native] when a thing is different from all others , it gets its own speciality .
[non-native] life is not easy on how it sounds when it is important for students understanding ideas and concepts but a faculty is the way that shows what can be featured and how can you explain it .
[native] a generation of italy 's best and brightest are now living in the uk and who knows if they will ever return .
[non-native] first of all if you go to a place with a tour guide you must always follow him .
[native] the uk does not have a severe attitude problem .
[non-native] the reason they outstand others is that they find a new way that others have not found or dare not to go .
[non-native] he will be welcomed by anyplace that he goes , and he will get lots of money and people would see and get to him closer .
[non-native] but because i am a student i know that it is most of the time possible to understand the ideas and concepts the teachers try to explain .
[native] we should kill off large chunks of people for `` the greater good ^ tm '' .
[native] the improvement over the past two decades has been remarkable , though to be honest the big movements were made and felt by the end of the 90s , with the past 15 years being norn iron coagulating into it 's current state .
[non-native] all in all , group traveling with a tour guide is the most effective way to making a trip without missing anything important .
[native] fair enough , though again , given we do n't know what the company is arguing , i 'm uncertain how you can claim it 's frivolous and groundless .
[native] when you look behind the scenes , someone wealthy is funding this , and they are sure to have certain * interests * in gaining sudden power ... a national spirit is an easy thing to take advantage of .
[non-native] they tend to forget that these old people were also young and have done all these activities .
[non-native] most car companies are aware of the new restrictions for car owners and these new models work around them .
[native] i just do n't think it 's as easy as that for them .
[non-native] and i have learned during my highschool time of strategies advertisements take .
[native] regardless , yes , not much is going to change .
[native] curse you large distances and low population density , making train travel unfeasible .
[native] the worst was ` babalon ' on the other side of the river .
[non-native] the software might be at risk of letting out personal information at first but it was resolve finally .
[non-native] so students should develope to improve their knowledge towards understanding the new concepts and explore their ideas .
[non-native] therefore i think most advertisements make products seem much better than really are .even though automobile has often been blamed for causing more and more pollution to our environment today , and issues have been raised to discuss how we develop other means to displace cars in order to stop worsen situation .
[non-native] in all , life is limited for a few years that a person can live .
[non-native] for instance , a professor who is specialised in accounting can influence others with his achievements in his field .
[non-native] for instance a child could be thinking that he is enjoying life when he/she is playing with his/her friends , now let 's see a old person having a vacation on the bahamas spending his/her time with the person that he/she loves .
[non-native] while , studying in the university , today 's students are requires to work and at the same time , concenterate on studies to get best of the grades .
[native] but certainly to the woman in question , it would feel indecent and wrong .
[non-native] i 'm sure that the technical evolution will provide a good environmental friendly alternative to today 's gasoline driven cars .
[non-native] thus , the products that advert is very different from real productthats a really really good subject , but acctully i have to say that i agree with specializing in one thing , beacuse if some one did then when he well give 100 % to making his catagory the best and making his job the best .
[native] but i think most people just object to telegraph reporting on the eu , given that it 's displayed a flagrant bias against it in the past and frequently misrepresents what 's going on .
[native] nobody in sweden thinks that there is a serious possibility of russians marching into stockholm and massacring the inhabitants , whereas israelis believe that an arab army marching into jerusalem and massacring the jewish inhabitants is not an unrealistic scenario if the idf fails in a war .
[non-native] i think that it is the point : a young person is more encoureged to change the society by his inexperiece , but at the end is society that changes him , and corrupts him making of him an adult person .
[native] also , rich governments do n't always share with the people .
[native] this will help you get served faster , especially if you 're making them make you cocktails .
[non-native] so you are better than the rest and therefore you are in a very comfortable postition .
[non-native] people believe that some products are better than others just because a certain movie star says it !
[native] while he 's dazed guy shoves drugs down his throat .
[native] this is huge for latvia , the baltic states ... scratch that , eastern europe as a whole .
[non-native] when a student approaches his learning process , he must go through two moments .
[non-native] to sum up ; succesful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
[non-native] some people go to abroad while some people travel in the country .
[native] also today i went to a conference and vladimir milov was there , with his usual stuff .
[non-native] we would not like to see every details of products from their pictures .i agree that .
[non-native] when it comes to secondary schools , students should be given their first choices , based on the knowledge they haev already obtained .
[native] the city has plans to switch them over by 2016 , which you can find here : http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/bauen/beleuchtung/de/gaslicht/
[non-native] the youth of today does not care about what happens to these people .
[non-native] however you should never forget to know something about the other topics .
[non-native] then , i thought of taking a glimpse of my life , and after a long look , i found out that i do not really spend my time in hat i love to do , and i had the explanation for that , which is ll the other hings ihave to do , because i am still a dependent person in everythingm and i can not do whatever i like to do because there is a duty that i have to do in life , while my grandmother is independent , knows what she wants , andhas the time to do it all , so she 's the one who 's given the chance to enjoy her life .
[native] it is impossible to predict all developments here , but there will be a lot of sabre-rattling and there is no point the uk even doing this if cameron is not clear that there is a chance that the uk could leave .
[non-native] if students reallly want to reach a correct use of their knowledge , they must know everything about the concepts and ideas that they are working with .
[native] it might help if you 'd stop letting them wear fascist paraphernalia while shouting `` exterminate ! ''
[native] free movement of labour [ also applies to the eea countries ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catid=457 ) ( norway etc. )
[native] belief is going to fall drastically with each passing generation in ireland .
[native] it 's quite unfair that people of british ancestry , who speak british and who fought for the empire , have a much more difficult time getting a visa than a romanian does .
[native] ask a ridiculous question , get a ridiculous answer i suppose .
[native] now , a good ol' game in eu4 on the other hand .
[non-native] for example , i met a young minister in our locality .
[native] if ( as i believe ) there is negligible chance of the uk succeeding in reforming the eu so that the benefits outweigh the costs , obviously it makes sense for the uk to abandon the eu .
[non-native] for that we need to concentrate a lot in that subject or field .
[native] you can still disagree with isds after reading it on other grounds , but please understand that there is no clause about ` negatively impacting profits ' or some such .
[native] that does n't necessarily mean it 's due to culture .
[non-native] furthermore it does n't take you so much time , you can work just an hour a day , or just two times a week .
[non-native] not only jobs , in practical life also people wont risk to do things they dont know .
[non-native] i guess , some people might contend that the life is getting busier and busier , there are some work to be done asap .
[non-native] first of the half week , i was the way far from the class that i was n't sure about what points she wants to point out .
[non-native] some of the statistic said that in 2002 there was alot of ads that show to the people the good things in the product and they forgot or they dont mention about the bad things and the descovered that the bad things in the product are more than the good things .
[native] attacking the eu would be suicide for russia ( mutual suicide ) .
[native] really if you 're going to set the moral high ground so high that nobody can disagree with a poster unless they 're from the same country , then you 're not going to have any serious discussion at all .
[native] because if we just measure by quantity we entirely lose the nuances involved .
[non-native] before learn that subject they need a lot of information about compter , that have to learn in high school but it might be a basic thing .
[native] that did n't answer my question , that answered my comment .
[non-native] they know to over come the bad situation when they are doing wrong .
[native] shucks , i was hoping you would come to say that the silent majority of russians really do believe in liberal democracy .
[native] all you ever link to is blogs and russia today videos , misrepresenting the facts and sensationalizing headlines , as you 've been called out for doing [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2h7d10/us_corporate_interests_british_lawmakers_excited/ckqf0m3 ) .
[native] [ many studies like this one from the bbc find britons are highly tolerant of migrants whilst highly hostile to immigration ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/legacy/thereporters/markeaston/2011/02/why_are_we_so_concerned_about_im.html ) .
[non-native] to summarize my personal view : i for myself always try to gather as much knowledge as possible even though i know it is just possible within certain limits given by the environment .
[non-native] at this point the advertisement concept came onto the stage .
[non-native] instead of that , they spend thier time to go the private academys to develope thier own carrer .
[native] beautiful country with a real chance to become a big tourist destination .
[native] i think it 's a dog and pony show .
[non-native] therefore , it seem to be more important to students to work for school than to help other people .
[native] man , you ran into the safest place you knew and still your ex tried to crash a commercial airliner into you .
[native] the point i am making is that if you want to find eu friendly press in the uk , you can .
[native] i 'd actually support a nato intervention if it was n't for the nuclear weapons involved .
[native] they are a completely different country , different language , culture and priorities and they should be able to determine if they want to be a part of spain or on their own .
[non-native] also because of environment issues such as pollution , many governments encourage public transportation such as the train or buses .
[non-native] if we go as a group , however , costs only 3000 yen .
[native] putin 's response to this , rather than rapproachment , seems to be to bluster and double down on the game of chicken he 's playing with his country 's economy and his citizen 's well-being .
[native] they will know that if they did come , the pro-eu side will end up losing votes .
[non-native] he is a chemical teacher , he often asks his students take more try after class .
[non-native] we should know about everything going on around us , if we specialize on one specific subject it will affect our future , the technologies , and we 'd be missing on alot .
[native] congress can also override a presidential veto if they pass a piece of legislation with a 2/3rds majority in each house .
[native] first , the region 's security was n't important enough for the politicians to get to do their job during a weekend and then it took them forever to reach at least some consensus , which was `` meh , we ca n't reach consensus , you tell them merkel '' .
[non-native] of course people start to wait their deaths after a specific age but we all obviously say that young people have more advantages against the older people .
[native] the ihh group is hardly a bunch of '' civilians '' ... even turkey raided them for terrorism .
[native] but i admit that is pushing it a bit in terms of relevance .
[non-native] traffic is the worst problem of all - it causes people to get late for appointments , meetings or other important places .
[native] you ca n't abuse an entire people and then expect them to like you for it !
[native] i am dealing with a serious idiot it seems .
[native] who 's power base was in the east in donetsk ?
[non-native] but rather if he understands the ideas and the concept behind the topic there is a higher chance he can remember that for a longer time .
[native] it 's * really hard * to be the people paying the highest wages on the planet , because it constricts the market for those products .
[non-native] we can get know each other during the trip .
[non-native] they show a world created around the product they advertise for , where it is vital .
[native] a lot of guesswork required for maltese and the finno-ugric & baltic languages , but i 'm familiar with all the slav and romance ones .
[native] c'mon mate , i 've pretty definitively disproven a bunch of times that it 's never about ` muh profits ' on here , and i 'm quite certain you 've read those discussions as well . .
[non-native] in fact , i imagine that from today to 2026 cars wo n't work with petrol but i hope with hydrogen , water or electricity or sun light which will permit to resolve the ecolicic problem we have to face on .
[non-native] probably if you are going to look for a new job the most qualified candidate is the one that is going to be chosen .
[native] i 've told you before , i 'm not just going to read random links you send to me with zero context .
[non-native] yes , life is all about trying new things and never stopping until you get what your goal or purpose is , and yes i totally agree with the statement of `` successfull people try new things and take the risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . ''i disagree with the statement because i do n't think two people 's experience of joy of life can be compared , be they young or be they old .
[native] incursions into canadian and european airspaces are similarly important .
[native] to be fair , the west also designed low-yield , tactical nuclear capabilities , such as nuclear artillery , to be used again armies in the field as opposed to military installations and cities and such .
[native] and all this nuclear `` spy '' undermining free enterprise ... bullocks
[non-native] moeover , in general , the fee of public traffic is inexpensive .
[non-native] the last but not least , since young people have n't experienced many things in life , they try new staff all the time .
[native] the cepr ( extremely renowned organization ) report commissioned by the ec indicated the complete opposite .
[native] there are just too many eu migrants here to simply kick out or require they claim a work visa , the overhead alone would be ludicrous .
[non-native] i disagree about the food 's product because they do n't care by the people at all , the important think for them is how to collect the money from people , but no body asks him selfe this quistion is that really this food healthy ? .
[native] thankfully people are starting to wake up to what stalin did .
[native] ( a ) either , or both , of the parties to the marriage is not a relevant national , .
[native] it 's still a shame no matter who it happens to .
[native] one is being negotiated by two parties , the eu and the us , and the other has 12 ( and soon to be more ) parties with completely different trade and investment priorities .
[non-native] these are some qualities that people accross nations , countires and communities associate youngsters with .
[non-native] finally what i can say is people now a days are more and more educated than old days , so most of the advertising should match up peoples thinking and they should be the closest to reality and the best looking to consumers .i would not agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
[non-native] i prefear to have a specialize knowledge in one specific subject .
[native] it 's the world-view that gave us noriega - `` a son of a bitch , but our son of a bitch '' - and most of the other excesses of south american dictatorship .
[native] the antics of the embassy are usually what brings the issue to the forefront , as well as heightened tensions such as the past summer , of course .
[native] putin has spent more than half his life in the soviet union , and his mindset still appears to be stuck in the soviet union .
[non-native] what proves that the person who had the face covered with acne before and who has a perfect skin looking now , had used the product ?
[native] ireland are looking to have their greenhouse gas target reduced because we heavily rely on agriculture ( cows ) which are a third of our emissions .
[native] we 've always paid for the water system , the only thing that will change is who pays what proportion of the cost .
[non-native] that each one of us take their own risk , even to let pass the good oportunities or even to take them , however not always take the risk is good and is the best choice .
[non-native] to understand the concepts also plays an particular role .
[native] that their notions and mindset about how things should be are not shared by everyone .
[native] unfortunately , i do n't think the energy charter treaty was worded very well , because it allows for more secrecy than i 'd like - for example , we ca n't even read on what grounds vattenfall is suing germany .
[native] the europhiles said our banking sector would collapse and move to frankfurt if we did n't join the euro .
[native] why does it suddenly become problematic if the parents want help ?
[native] i just find the hypocrisy about immigration to britain bizarre .
[native] if you remove the uk figures from the eu figures , it looks like the reu has lost jobs over the last two years .
[native] you made the mistake of engaging with / u/zankerh .
[native] that 's a result of how sweden collects it 's rape statistics and how it defines rape .
[non-native] but as the countries develop over the next few years their infrastructure would improve substantially and traffic conditions would improve considerably , again favoring car usage .
[non-native] therefore , i do n't think they get time left to help ; sometimes it is not enough for sleep .
[non-native] as a result , if many younges want to contribute to their communites , they do not have time to care about the helping the communites .
[non-native] some tend to understand the ideas and concept , but in an another way , there are some who perfer to understand only the facts .
[native] i think the radicalism claim is crap but there 's some truth in the last two claims .
[non-native] i dont think so it is really hard cause you can get a guidebook from aven simple gas station .
[native] and i 'm certain i heard some other stuff too but i 'm also poor at identifying languages .
[non-native] now , there are a lot of cars getting more modern .
[non-native] they always say that the trip is not even worthwhile without the two key ingredients : a good group and a good guide .
[non-native] it 's not cost a lot of time for us to help our communities .
[native] one certainly can , when one has their own sovereignty .
[non-native] for instance , hee-ya , a 19-year-old girl with only four fingers , is now a successful pianist in korea .
[native] i have seen it in what canadians now refer to as `` bramladesh ''
[native] you seem to be more offended by the vague idea of the uk negotiating for itself rather than any specific slight and are taking all of this very personally .
[native] and i 'm sure they 're all over the moon considerin they 've got almost as many euroskeptics as the british
[non-native] if they try new things and take risks to improve their situations or earn more money for example but after they work to have it they will probably succed .
[native] this was started by the invasion of eastern ukraine by russian operatives .
[non-native] like learning the language if someone have that language background already , it will help that person learn more effective .
[non-native] he wo n't usually think about giving some of his allowance to a charity organization .
[non-native] in sum of , you must cleal \ rly and depplyi partly agree with the statement that the use of cars will dicrease in twenty years .
[non-native] the problem is not how lot car there is , but how may using car !
[non-native] they do n't know the fear and they give to the world the best of theirself .
[non-native] in brief , young people is just on the arising phase of their lifes , and it is the right time for them to enjoy the life which is still somewhat mysterious .technological advancements allow the modern man use faster and more modern cars .
[native] its largest city is in europe whether you like it or not .
[native] only the united kingdom , ireland and sweden chose to allow eu8 nationals full access to their labour markets .
[non-native] it 's pretty amazing they just get the perfect enviroment in a commercial , everything is so well planned that even if it did n't seem good enough for you , they are going to make it seem in other commercial , poster , etc .
[non-native] disease 's would spread because their wont be any cures for them .
[non-native] they just don ' have to worry about reserving the resturant or doing some speacial activities .
[native] what 's the small area in italy that calls it `` cervisia '' ?
[non-native] i have studied an enjeneering and i almost always take courses connected with my major , so courses related to enjeneering .
[non-native] undoubltly , advertisement helps to show a product much better that it actually is only if the advertisement is good .
[non-native] however , i disagree with the thinking about traveling .
[native] there have already been a large amount of deserters .
[native] ~ ~ actually , i do , but only on a personal , selfish level .
[non-native] reffering to enother subject as sociology what it is important , for example , it is to remember that someone 's behaviour can be modified by the society 's response to his action .
[non-native] great discoveries only happen when the people take chance and risk .
[native] that 's got nothing to do with environmental or health regulations , or what-have-you , but rather with tariffs and ntbs .
[native] ** disclaimer : ** all my unofficial armchair opinions .
[non-native] in my opinion a broad knowledge is an ideal which is very hard to reach .
[non-native] although people can have broad knowledge from many academic subjects , it is too nallow to use in real world .
[non-native] people would prefer to have the one which was better presented visually .
[native] they acknowledge change occuring , they just do n't want to believe they came from a less developed ancestor .
[native] as the article says : > as the nta has modified the charging structure for travel zones , costs and prepaid travel deals have made it difficult to provide exact comparisons .
[native] he was later rightfully killed for advocating minimum pricing for off licenses .
[non-native] in my point of view both are as important .
[non-native] furthermore , it will be a good opportunity to interact with people from different nationalities and different cultures .
[native] > the eu 's 2001 information society directive contains a clause that says photos of architectural projects in public spaces can be taken free of charge .
[non-native] so it is easy way to make a success that is to be a specialist in a field .
[native] and even if he did , how does that paint him out as a negative or bad individual ?
[native] our record breaking debt would cancel a lot of it out .
[native] when has the bbc ever been critical of the british government ?
[native] they are wasting their own money on fuel and arms flying around while their currency devalues daily and their foreign currency reserves dwindle .
[native] given this , i think it is somewhat odd that you think that others who thing that should be limits on immigration must be xenophobic .
[non-native] as a saleperon , i always need to some what i have stated so far is to proved that i agree the statement .
[native] not to mention inject much-needed competition into the pc and smartphone marketplace .
[non-native] later you need the concepts to develop its features and the perations it needs .
[non-native] on a personal experience , some specific cultures as chinese or japanese like when you seem to be a specialist about something : they will trust you easily for business negociations .
[native] this is to keep the military subservient to the civilian government .
[native] however , these ethnic backgrounds played a very serious role in american life throughout most of american history up until very recently .
[native] on another note , ussr-era grammar and spelling `` reforms '' artificially shoehorned written belarusian to be more like russian , and ended up basically creating a very messed-up language not so suited for everyday use .

[native] but between far-right and centre-right is right , and between far-left and centre-left is left .

[native] haha , i love when the only people that i agree with here are brits .
[non-native] pollution is a big problem in societies now so they are trying to find ways to reduce the number of cars to reduce pollution .

[non-native] for instance one person has learnt lot of fundamentals about the mba but he has not specialize in one area like finance .
[non-native] one of the points that i totally disagree with is when they show us two different situations or images .

[native] and with ttip and ttp they gain even more rights and so a lot of critical analysts are stunned by these two treaties .
[non-native] of course in the advertisements this fake on the products makes the products seem efficient and desirable .
[native] but someone said it was because the european commission wants to stop ep members looking at not anti-ttip sentiments on my order !
[native] but do n't mistake that as a lack of desire to have a sphere of influence , because they very much have one .
[non-native] a broader skill base , is what even professional organizations ask for .
[non-native] no matter if people are successful in their carreer or in sports , they probably have made the experience that without trying something new and putting something at risk nothing will change .

[native] also , lingering feelings ( common in elderly ) from sino-soviet split , causing stereotypes of russians as unreliable ( khrushchev being an unreliable stalinist )
[native] israel and ireland do not get on well diplomatically , so they decided to staff their embassy here with internet trolls and passport thieves .
[non-native] finally , my third supporting point is related to the social life of people .
[non-native] in addition to that , the statment that has been made against young people is a very general statment , since not all young people do not give enough time to their communities .
[native] and just as that memory impacts france and germany now , the uk 's memory impacts it .

[non-native] they started to ordered after the ad dirictlly and they dont asked about the company if it is famous or not and some of them beileve all the ads even if someone said to them this ad makes the product seem much better than they really are .
[native] the fact that there is n't even an obvious candidate and people in the eu ca n't decide whether they think it should be paris or frankfurt makes me think that london does not have much competition from them .

[native] > do you really think that the ukranians are going to turn down some guys because they believe in a questionable ideology ?
[native] and it 's not unwise to expect this trend to continue at all if it 's * specifically designed & influenced too * .
[non-native] garbament could not allow free when during or after war .
[non-native] a way , you wont go by reflecting only on your experiences .
[non-native] maybe in the future , in metropolitan cities like new york and istanbul , some people might stop using their cars or can be forced to do so because of the terrible trafic problem .
[non-native] the people do n't want to walk or ride a bike anymore because they are to lazie to do that and they think that the car can solve their problems of moving .

[non-native] energy is what takes us from one place to another ; to eat or not to eat ; to do things or not to things ; to enjoy life or not to enjoy life .
[native] do people still hold their sides in the dispute ?
[native] do n't worry , you 'll grow out of it .
[non-native] but then it is important to specialize in one specific subject , because in this way i can deepen my knowledge on a particular argument that i prefer and that is more interesting for me , for satisfy my curiosity .
[non-native] if you want to analyse somethink you need a concept , a kind of roadmap to do it , if you want to create or develop innovative products you also have to follow a determined concept .

[native] senior conservatives like david davis have been practically non-existent since cameron came to power .
[native] ok , and i had a burning desire to bring to peoples attention that he was spamming / r/europe with anti-ttip posts .

[native] also his definition of a `` great '' russia is not just being respected , but also being feared .
[native] california also has a similar economy size to russia .
[native] and they take in far more asylum seekers than , say , australia or japan .
[non-native] next , young people do not have los of experience about life .
[non-native] though this may sound as being less responsible , but a person only grows when he moves out of his comfort zone .
[non-native] i can suggest the above view by the following eg :
[non-native] so they are not able to take enough time to see each place because they have to go next on time .
[native] as to your claims about illegals in the us and murder rates , i 'm pretty sure you 've never been to the us if you are making these claims .
[non-native] students learn that there are different fundamental forces that act on a flying ball .
[non-native] with a tour guide , the places we vist will be severely limited , because everything including hotels to say , stores to go and places to see are all fixed before the trip .
[native] the vast majority of italians ) get to increase their total number of spoken languages ?
[native] they 're certainly not a leading voice on trade issues either , so i have no idea where you got that .
[non-native] also if the quantity is increased then more middle class people will be attracted to that product .
[non-native] they probably do n't want to miss out some special place or food in that country .
[non-native] in my opinion , young people do not help their communuties as much as they use to , because they think that they have better things to do like the use of technology and studying .
[non-native] teenagers enjoy their lives by spending time on parties , watching movies .
[non-native] however , as you learned the fact , you can have your own opinions about it .
[native] guns are pretty ubiquitous in canada , and we have a pretty long history of cool things being available .
[native] if spain let catalonia go and the uk let scotland go , that would net some quick and cheap imperial authority points .
[native] it does n't sound like you 've ever owned an apartment .
[native] yeah , i have noticed this from my french friends , it seems that attitudes are changing .
[native] having russian military fired on within ukrainian territory is pretty damning evidence of foul play .
[native] but to remain relevant on the world stage , it must unite in order to compete .
[native] i looked it up , it 's the media trying to make a story out of nothing .
[native] i 'm an ex-christian , and i can faithfully tell you that every single creationist i have * ever * met have been batshit crazy .
[non-native] one of this is the price of oil or fuel .
[native] there is just no way that acts like this should be allowed to go unpunished .
[non-native] besides this problem , people that owns cars feel they depends on it because they take it so oftently .
[native] to be fair to the scots , the way the referendum question was posed precluded having a proper debate .
[non-native] these activities are difficult to stop because they help the students to learn the skills that are essential in the real world such as time management , responsibility , team work and so on .
[non-native] students learning through facts which may more impress them than just let them understand the concepts , so they may learn it more effective and do not just learn the idea from the book , learn the facts are more interesting student to memonrise it .
[native] putting criminals into crippling debt will only encourage engaging in crime to survive .
[non-native] finally , be confident about making new things even though you are responsible about how your new things impact in the world .
[native] for a long time , under the brenton woods system , countries pegged their currencies to the usd ; and there are still plenty of countries that continue the practice ( the swiss , for example ) .
[non-native] in particular , the population of developing countries is increasing at a rapid rate , and many of these countries are attaining very high rates of development .
[native] in ukraine , [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_coffee ) is turkish coffee .
[non-native] because i consider osaka gas as a environmen-friendly company .
[native] i understand what it means , i still do n't understand the relevancy .
[native] needless to say , in this kind of environment , the uk will always be the preferred venue of finance .
[non-native] enjoying life in my opinion may be very very different from someone else opinion .
[non-native] the person that has knowledge in different topis is a complet person compared to one that only focuses on one subject .
[non-native] in my personal case i found that specializing was a much better thing to do .
[native] if these parts of the eurozone were to leave the euro , their new currency would depreciate relative to the euro .
[non-native] so , in order to reach some remote places , one has no other option then to go by car .
[non-native] is n't as good as you cool have refering to the studies you ` ve
[non-native] thus young people enjoy life more than older people do .
[non-native] i think it essential for us to reduce the number of cars .
[non-native] i think infact that a specialized worker has often to focus on few matters only and can not keep pursuing a broad knowledge on different subjects .
[non-native] in these reason , i think that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
[non-native] for example , i go to help a lot of young students to study and to learnt every weeks .
[non-native] we can also take an example of ` orkut .
[native] the uk suffered pretty heavily in the recent recession , i 'd hardly say it 's so strong that it feels like it can tell everyone to fuck off .
[non-native] according to scientific experiments , the active person are happier than the inactive person as young people .
[non-native] travelling in a group has the advantage that the traveller is instantly surrounded either by people he or she knows or by other travellers with the same time schedule and intentions .
[non-native] only if successful people cared about fame and money then i surely think that percentage of successful people living would have been far higher than it exists .
[native] yeah , i think i was accused of being a putin bot several times .
[non-native] while if the tourists are in group , we can look after one another , and also can take care of the belongs when some people go to the washroom .
[non-native] using cars will be clearly more convenient in twenty years .
[native] your choice of vernacular caused me to read your whole comment with an irish accent .
[native] but we 'll see what comes out of the war on isis .
[native] war can sprout from a multitude of conflicts , the brits used to team up with russia too , whenever the continent was under threat of a state having hegemony over it .
[native] that 's just as vital to the operation and success of the restaurant or bar as the food and drink menu .
[native] the aim should be to use both blades of the scissors : direct debt reduction and recapitalisation on the one hand and strong economic growth on the other .
[non-native] on the other hand i would not spend any money or risk in some business i have got no clue about .
[native] we place a huge amount of trust in judges .
[native] christians in rome in the first centuries were peaceful , until the religion became a tool of the political establishment and the state religion .
[non-native] another example that young people enjoy life more than older people is that young people can fool around more compared to older people .
[non-native] one exapmple of this kind is twchnology of cochlear implant for hearing disables people , it took years for deaf person to speak , socilaise like anyother talking child .
[native] canada has universal health care , universal access to abortions , limited access to weapons of which it is hunting weapons , much more relaxed tv , music , video games and movies rating systems , legalized same-sex marriage across the board , canadians enjoy more rights then americans do .
[native] cameron is coming out with this line of crap to pander to ukip leaning tory voters .
[native] flag of the eu , surely , or the council of europe ?
[native] the suppression of the hungarian revolution was a disgusting and shameful act and i hope it is one that history will not forget .
[native] since turkey has just such a history dealing with the line between de jure and de facto sovereignty , i thought it pertinent to bring it up .
[native] it 's shameless tourist promotion , but yeah it looks really unoriginal and a bit tacky .
[native] they are bros , who make jokes , which would be offensive to non-bros , at each other .
[non-native] collecting the various facts an figures about an particular topic really helps a student to create new ideas an creativity in their mind , an that will be help ful for them in getting the fact throughly .
[non-native] therefore people every body in the wold can count on them , such as the government , health care provider , section of cultural , section of education and commercial .
[native] it 's fucking scary how entrapped that is in turkish culture .
[non-native] thanks to technology a lot of new future machines , a part from the plane , will be discovers , so the cars will be abandoned .
[non-native] the metro , is a faster mode of trains , it can be used to travel short distances - which may take the place of cars .
[native] there are only a finite number of jobs available , and those jobs are not as plentiful as they once were because a lot of them have been replaced by machines .
[non-native] secondly , young people do not know how to communicate with the many kind of people .
[non-native] company 's do research , investigations and interviews to find out ways to attract customers , to find out what people are looking for .
[non-native] therefore , the companies should think of how much money that it might loose for such a stupid behavior .
[non-native] here some examples which support the learning facts , if we are able to learn the facts effectively then we can achieve some better results in the life .recently i have reed on a news an article that speak about the knowledge of many academic subjects .
[non-native] the bad guy bit the little kitty on his home 's window side and put the picture on the website .
[native] i thought people would just be piling it under the bed .
[non-native] i have seen various programs been held for senior citizens in our society .
[non-native] it is based on the situation that customers ordinally make a judge from the advertisement whether they buy it or not .
[non-native] young people are the most people who can enjoy their life .
[native] why not just some suburb in oslo where people are more likely to mix with people from the same suburb ?
[non-native] you are going to do a job , or run a business , for which your basics in that should be strong and you should have good knowledge about that subject .
[non-native] you just follow others steps , without thinking deeply .
[non-native] however , i have to say that a successful person is a person that is able to take some risks only when risks are proportionated to the benefits carried by doing new things .
[native] and stop saying `` palestinian muslims , '' quite a few palestinians were christians before they were displaced in the nakba .
[non-native] also , even students did n't learn , they understand concept and ideas of materials .
[native] i think the plan is to basically treat transnistria the same way the eu and the republic of cyprus treats northern cyprus .
[native] ever since , i 've always thought for whatever your faults , you seem to have a very realistic self image of your nation and politics .
[non-native] but even though it is surely better to have this broad knowledge i will never say a bad word about someone who just tries to be the best in his primary subject .i disagree with the statement .
[non-native] to begin with , any product association requires the company 's high quality of product so it actually seem better when people get their product and see what their product has special things on the surface of it than just watching it through advertisement .
[non-native] although i know that they are selfish and ridiculous opinions but that is why i beleive young people nowdays do not give enough yimr yi think that the advertisement is what really push you to buy something that you need , or think you may need .
[native] i do n't speak for only scotland as i 'm not very well informed on what the indepdnence movement is campaigning on .
[native] you 'd only ever hear of a male babysitter if he 's the older brother of the kids being babysat .
[non-native] i feel that those who nowadays use other means of transportation desire to have a car .
[non-native] well if they sell you a broken item what if the difference .
[non-native] finally the pubblic tranports are becoming more efficent and there are a lot of projects to construct new metropolitan line , railways station and to increase the number of buses , so iwill be more easy and fast to use pubblic transport .
[non-native] even then we find older people laughing and always present and supporting these young generation .
[non-native] second , learning broad knowledge provide us the oppotunities to think broadly .
[native] they 've killed their own citizens to beat these guys .
[non-native] i beleive that if a person do not like risks and has a know-how about something and beleives that he/she can be better in this field by working a lot and searching new strategies or taking lessons about that topic .
[non-native] so , in conclusion i feel that nowadays it is just not possible to have such a wide range of knowledge and as a matter of fact i think that it is not necessary if people of different subjects start working together .generally , traviling to many places and make a differant experiance in our live is very good idea for people who want to explorare many place .
[non-native] the two types of viewpoints will be suggested as follows .
[non-native] he should have atleast some basic knowledge related to any field .
[non-native] teaching facts and demanding these from student as a feedback in the examinatins or what else , makes students memorize the materials and show them without any comment .
[non-native] the better he can handle his money , the more risks he can take .
[non-native] for example , the engineers now ont only need to know about engineering , but also need to have the ablity to use computer .
[non-native] all these abstracted issues have directly or indirectly leads the young boys far a way from helping and lood after thier community , which is a petty .for sure im totally agree with that statement , in adition to that i will explain why for two points of viewing , one personal and another more objective ; i remember long time ago , when i was studing a elemental school all teachers were making us to stock in our memory useless data , names and another crappy stuff that nowadays i still not using .
[native] they were n't going to be lost , people were going to change from their jobs to jobs with better conditions .
[native] seems to be the case that that model , the federal uk would suit best although i do n't know how well some mps in westminster would take to that suggestion ( tory and ukip ) .
[non-native] it 's a question of choices , it 's not that they do n't have time to dedicate to their community .
[non-native] the successful people maybe a rich or scientice or a politican .
[non-native] it depends on people 's state of mind , on politics , and on the decisions that are going to be taken .
[native] i do n't know about what they 've done in the past , but the canadian health and environmental departments both stated that their products were not dangerous as a fuel additive in this case , hence why they won .
[non-native] secondly , being stable is like a death , movement is the foundationstone of the world .
[non-native] when the tour guide is taking care of all the above things we as tourist can just relax and enjoy the trip .
[native] almost all major media production is based in london .
[non-native] older generations often disapprove of the behaviour of young people , and this disapproval is obvious in the way that we understand young people 's commitment to their community .
[native] arabs and other foreigners are fine but not turks ?
[non-native] by consedering these , many people will stop using cars in feature .
[non-native] such a process cause an other way of studying and thinking .
[native] there 's a reason people do n't fuck with freedom of the press .
[non-native] but it is not fair if the product ca n't reflect what the advertisment is saying .
[native] the phrase `` class war '' just makes me imagine classy victorian gentlemen going into battle like `` 300 '' with cricket bats .
[non-native] in conclusion , being a specialist on a certain field is more remarkable and worthable to improve our society .
[native] why do n't ya have a drink and cheer up .
[native] the uk was one of a group of countries ( including notably the netherlands , sweden and denmark ) that wnated the eu budget to be cut .
[native] a limited supply results in higher prices which all russians are happy to pay , especially when the average russian makes $ 12,000 a year .
[native] - there 's a lot of red tape for some pretty simple things and bureaucracy is even slower than most places .
[non-native] first of all , i 'm one of the believers of the famous quote : `` time is money . ''
[native] russia , will not place itself in a situation that does not allow it to argue for the defense of the russian nation as its primary goal .
[native] then should n't the members of the mosque be donating their money to fund its upkeep ?
[native] is that why those red white stripes are referred to as the bars of aragÃ³n ?
[non-native] therefore , i agree the fact that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are which is true and understandable in many way .in my opinion , success is mainly the result of realized chances and opportunities .
[non-native] all what people want is what gives them a good impression in any art of media .
[non-native] a successful person is not satisfied with the knowledge he has got and always try to do one better .
[native] no , it 's just victim of huge earthquakes .
[non-native] first of all , young people are interested in their own life and how to make it better for them .
[non-native] either if this person is guilty or not guilty .
[native] america has n't had a threat to it 's independence since it 's revolution .
[non-native] for example , in tv commercials , they uses music togather and some musics are very simple and fun that can be easy to remember to whome wich has been heared it .
[native] it 's another thing entirely when it was people 's parents and grandparents .
[non-native] it is also clear that competition is among the major reasons that pushes the seller to make the public compare their products to their competitors ' .
[non-native] mix up together the the two things and you 'll have a picture of our future and so yes , there will be fewer cars in the next twenty years .no i fully disagree , according to my perception it is important for students to learn facts than understanding ideas and concepts .
[native] you 're gon na have a really bad day when you realise democracy does n't exist and we still use feudalism
[non-native] you just learn how to write a normal writing .
[non-native] most of these companies are not able to succeed in the bussiness world ; majority of them go out of bussiness after five years or so .
[native] i think that 's what he was referring to by a `` simple card ''
[native] you ca n't just continue to offer ` unlimited liquidity ' to banks without expecting reasonable reforms to fund their possible failure and reduce risk .
[non-native] i hope that this fact will change in future .i agree to the given statement .
[non-native] the questions will be answered if you gave in every information you have gathered when you want to prepare if this person did or did not kill these people .
[native] i understand your point , but you seem focused on things that are n't necessarily `` environmental '' , but are instead related more generally to public health and consumer protection .
[non-native] all theses reasons show in twenty years the numbers of cars will increase compared to what we have todaysaying wether or not knowing many academic subjects superficially is better than specialize in one speficic area of competence is very hard .
[native] just do n't talk about it , it 'll only cause grief and bitter arguments .
[native] it was hard to tell the difference , the way you went about explaining , so job done i suppose .
[native] the wars of tomorrow , in my opinion , are going to be quick , limited & decisive for those very reasons , hence why you have countries like china focusing on those very things in their military doctrine .
[non-native] after the first month of the winter season , i was unhappy to find the the gas charge was extramely higher than i expected , i noticed from the televison advertisement that there was some kind of heater seemd very good , it was powerful , good looking , and i went to the store and bought it at once .
[non-native] that will make our socity better and teach how to care other people .the question being raised is if i agree or not to the idea that advertisements make a great impact in products .
[native] we 're obviously confused with australia , but i 've had people think we were next to england as well .
[native] also , there 's the absolutely magical [ kuukene ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bap6jugfgka ) by trad.attack !
[native] you can consider this `` winning '' if that 's what 's important to you .
[non-native] therefore , i think it is important to change this misthinking .
[non-native] paralel to raising in her/his profession , living standarts will also improve .
[native] also , the iran example is another example of how ridiculous the arab states are at the moment .
[non-native] sadly , this is still not the case nowadays .
[non-native] most known and used way of transportation is using car .
[native] this is all absurd > an independent scotland can help nato become a denuclearizing force why would nato denuclearize ?
[native] > what / u/truicidator is talking about is fantasy that has exactly zero chance of occurring .
[native] it all just seems like everyone here on / r/europe is getting a bit whipped up into a tizzy because we 're vocal about shit that worries us whereas other nations seem to just keep quiet and then ignore the laws they do n't like .
[non-native] it seems that communities have become much bigger in the last century .
[native] > i prefer a brexit , but i fear farage and cameron are bluffing farage and cameron have different views .
[non-native] however , they can not make relation between their subjects and the other subjects .
[native] milk quotas are set to be eradicated in 2015 .
[native] > homosexualism ah , the great isms of the modern world .
[native] i plan to live in budapest for at least a year so hopefully i 'll get decent at the language then !
[non-native] according to these advertisements , these cars were so good that it was hard to believe that they were actually not from future .
[non-native] in conclusion i would like to say that people that are successful are aware of the fact that there is a need for development and risk for every single success .
[native] right , so does this apply to every medium ?
[non-native] studying art , is the first step for my plan .
[native] he thought we could rebuild iraq from the ground-up ; free of any baathist influence .
[non-native] doing job in one concerd subject is our aim .
[native] > this is n't a `` race '' or a `` candidacy '' , it 's a process that will evolve organically .
[native] yeah , offering social benefits is pretty much the antithesis of a right wing policy .
[non-native] so the best way is to have a personal car .
[non-native] i think that this is true because now everithing is linked to one another , you may find many things that are related to your job but are not the base of your focus , this will force you to adapt to the problem in matter .
[native] > it 's also extremely unlikely that a couple who could afford a surrogacy pregnancy can only afford one child , unless we 're talking about government subsidized surrogacy .
[native] the figure for non-eea immigrants is about - # 150b , so apparently not .
[non-native] on other hand , many subject approach , despite of small short term advantages has nothing much to offer in the students long term career .
[native] you 're absolutely right , it wo n't divide your family up despite the spanish ties , sorry if it seemed like i was drawing that conclusion .
[non-native] i am going to give you two reasons why you should do only what you already know so as to be successful .
[non-native] travelling by train is not an easy task during peak office hours and if one is little late to the railway station , he or she misses the train and has no other option than to wait for sometime to catch another train .
[native] yeah , this is the first i 've heard .
[native] isds prevents political parties from favouring their contributors over foreigners by enacting biased laws such as these .
[non-native] we all have a different method to handle those situations and problems .
[native] for halloween there was a picture uploaded of some kids in halloween costumes way back in the 60s i believe .
[non-native] it 's also the only way to get people aware of a new product , and obviously the better is this product , the more people will buy , even if it 's just to try .
[non-native] here we can see that even in a small community like the house in my example is not working together .
[native] in hard times , for example , you are expected to underreport your overtime too , to decrease expenses for the company .
[native] you make it sound as though our children are being force-fed propaganda .
[non-native] in my country , there is one specific culture that we should honor the olders and we all want to and plan on becoming affluent and hapy in the period when we become older people .
[non-native] in conclsion , it is better to have droad knowledge of one or specialized academic subject than many subject .according my opinion are both necessary , in this century .
[native] so did the ones they replaced , who refused to acknowledge mossad 's abuse of irish passports .
[non-native] a specialized worker can be considered as an asset , but as his/her specialization goes out of business , the worker will not be able to suit new roles .
[non-native] instead of that , they wanted to spend time for their own interest .
[non-native] furthermore , each subject area in itself has lots of academic literature about the knowlege accumulated throughout the ages in it .
[native] for example , in canada , the politicians speak both french and english during all [ press conferences ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdgzeitk-gc&amp;list=uuafg7nuzt7dbn_1znayr_yq ) , every [ publication ] ( http://www.2672paratus.ca/documents/cfdressinstr2011.pdf ) is in both languages , they interchange between french and english during parliamentary [ debates ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4wcadndacu ) , all federal gov [ signs ] ( http://www.globalgraphica.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/usa-canada-border-sign-welcome-inspection-control-august-2010-nyc-montreal.jpg ) are in both languages , you get the point .
[native] it 's interesting because my grandfather wrote a book about hungary after moving here .
[native] it is a common agriculture policy to reduce distortions across the common market : you ca n't efficently protect a particlar sector across a free trade area unless it is common across that area .
[non-native] most of people do n't like poet because of words .
[non-native] the reason for presenting political reasons to prove my argument is that in some countries , for example in turkey , there are some distinct rules in making the product available to use for people ; because these products shoud be reliable , tested in order to avoid the devastating results after using them .
[non-native] the hardwork he has done for getting that good grade may be immense .
[non-native] the bus service is becoming more adapted to the needs of the citizens ' needs such as comfort and availability .
[native] > this situation is ideal for china because it will force the us to commit its military capital outside of the pacific theater .
[non-native] students would properly never be able to learn in depth about the ideas represented in the `` scarlet letter '' .
[non-native] so in the end i would like to conclude that its always better to sutdy and specialise in one subject only because with this person is able to focus in one direction only and doesn ; t get hampered by other things and this brings more recognition and growth opprtunities in his life and his life becomes more organised ,traveling around the world and discovering new places you never seen before is the most pleasure thing to do for a lot of people .
[non-native] its always good to know about various aspects of life similarly its always good to have knowledge about various academic fields thats why we have all the subjects when we are in junior classes but as we grow the subjects however , i strongly believe that one should specialize in one particular subject .
[native] and there are 16 states within the us that have lower unemployment rates than germany .
[native] this means we can get a loan to pay you back with interest and then repay the new loan from our own pocket saving us ~ $ 400 million a year in repayments to the uk , imf and ecb .
[non-native] these concepts and ideas will take a major role in several applications .
[non-native] that is , these social concept change on the community is one of the main reasons that young people these days do n't give enough time to helping community .
[native] people on benefits/chavs/scum who do n't work and need an excuse to say `` they 're taking all our jobs '' .
[native] there are only a handful of unmistakable european countries for most foreigners .
[non-native] besides , in order to convince people use these tranporters rather than their own cars , the new brand transporters have to be much more comfortable than the cars used by people .
[native] since out of all the cities , warsaw happened to be the most troublesome , partisan active capital , it would not only be cleansed of the enemies of the third reich , but also be set and example for other occupied major cities .
[native] leaving one big multi cultral mass of poor people in services : let me know how competing with india works out .
[non-native] the reasons why i can not clrearly express my observation is that it depends on the situation such as the countries or the length of the stay .
[native] > how do you separate the good apples from the bad , without offending a lot of people and being called a bigot ?
[native] we do n't have a robust trading relationship with russia to use as leverage for sanctions .
[native] both of my grandmothers are 100 % irish by heritage .
[non-native] my final opinion would be that not more than the older . ..in the past , the cars had developed from a luxury skill to a usual material .
[non-native] mostly , colleges do not care about the privat and social life of students but about their marks in school .
[native] after draining the eurozone and consolidating as much of it 's capital as feasibly possible in germany , the next logical step would be to take advantage of that by opening the absolutely huge resource markets of russia , * ala * nordstream , even if it goes against the interests & security situation of their fellow eastern european eu member-states .
[native] it is encouraging to see something shake up what it is traditionally two-party system .
[native] i 'm sorry as a dane you 're supposed to conform to our stereotype of a youthful left wing warrior of justice and not an old conservative cave man who 's destroying europe .
[non-native] from my point of view those who are not afraid about the future bad consequences of their actions have more time to concentrate in their actions .
[native] meanwhile , millions of israelis have fled to europe , recreating the scenes of postwar displaced persons camps , and europeans whine about accommodating so many refugees , stating defiantly that they do n't have to feel guilty about whining about jewish refugees because the holocaust was so long ago .
[native] can you give me some of those danske memes ?
[native] why the additive has also been added to fuels in australia in 2000 ?
[native] maybe he looks at the eu or nafta and thinks `` this is n't any better '' and for russia and russians , he might be right .
[native] over here roast lamb is probably considered the quintessential new zealand dish , but the gravy and vegetables ( barring perhaps kumara and yams ) are mostly standard british fare .
[non-native] thus , more and more students are usually interested in gaining money or getting a good carrier .
[non-native] although fossil fuel consumption would become low , the number of cars would see a dramatic increase .
[non-native] i hop , we will fewer cars in the futher .
[non-native] so what do you think about this opinion ?in todays modern and fast moving world , `` jack of all and master of none '' , dosnt work at all .

[native] what about if you add the cost of health insurance into the mix ?
[native] why does the public need to observe her face ?
[native] if you 're against 16 for that reason , you should be against 18 as well .
[non-native] it the picture , the camera got a great metalic texture and looked very well built .
[non-native] instead , they may long for having a plane for themselves .
[native] i would be for a system that has romanian and bulgarians pay for a visa but then get all the money back upon departure from canada .
[non-native] so , as a conclusion i can say that taking risks is the best way to live this life .i am not sure wether adolescent or older people are the happier ones since i am myself in my early twenties .
[non-native] for example , in korea , there were baby booms after the war in 1950 .
[non-native] the better way to know a fact is to attemp getting it by ourselves .
[non-native] some people argue as if its a general truth that if you want to be a seccessful person you dont have to need to take risks .
[non-native] but the complete understanding of something comes with the acknowledgement of its basis .
[native] in the end , i think it 's really irrational to think that belief in religion has to be irrational since it is n't empirical .
[non-native] finally , if the students can learn the ideas and concepts instead of being told the results , they will learn how to think and judge things by themselves .
[native] and you rely on no information you can show us , so theres that .
[non-native] you ca n't sell something and know it is not that what you will present .
[non-native] it is a regrettable situation , but it is a situation that canbe improved if students are given more free time and a stronger sense of community .
[native] i do n't know about that oecd one , seems kind of dodgy , it shows the us as 1st and 23rd for two separate years .
[non-native] however , the blend of the theory of accounting and informaiton in the last centry produced a new catelog named the theory of accounting information .
[native] there 's still a lot of problems ; the psni is in most respects a continuation of the * supremely biased * ruc ( rather than making reforms to make the body more palatable to nationalists they simply hired poles to bring their catholic/protestant quota up to parity ) , our mps are still a bunch of lazy wankshafts and they 're almost all from the hardline parties ( the unionist dup and nationalist sinn fein ) , and there 's still some streets in belfast you would n't walk down with an ireland jersey on ( it 's my experience that the taegs are better about this than the prods ) but the days of bomb threats , shootings , kneecappings and not being able to walk down down the road without being super-nervous about unattended bags are long gone .
[non-native] when we consider successful people in the world , we can obviously see that a big percentage of them chose the way to specialize in one specific subject .
[native] ian wright , krishnan murphy , chuka umunna are all examples of many many prominent people who are not white , but are generaly looked on as just as british as someone who is .
[native] > if you disagree on an important issue or two , great .
[native] they should have used the face designs for the backs of our euro coins instead of the harp .
[non-native] in understanding the the given topic the student can easily grasp the related facts an figures about the topic or subject , an can easily memorise them .
[non-native] cars have brought us much convenience to transport while they have caused various social or ecological problems such as traffic jams , noise , traffic accidents , air pollution , too much consumption of petroleum and so on .
[native] its not ignorance , most of us are aware of what goes on up there .
[non-native] furthermore , because of its waste of time and distraction , having a many many academic subjects might be considerd as a disadvantafe .
[native] is there really a `` one size fits all '' definition of what is acceptable and what is n't ?
[non-native] usually , if you go with your friend or family , you need to take care about them , you need to discuss where to go before getting out of the hotel .
[native] even italy 's internet , at it 's laughably low average , is faster than mine .
[non-native] so , i conclude that anyone who believes that young people doesnt have time to help others are on the wrong assumpsion and i want each and every one to follow the above mentioned concept .every people would like to be succesful in order to reach their aims which would differ person to person in terms of the place of domicile , education , likes and disilkes .
[non-native] also young people of diiferent countries have taken up the responsibility of joining the relief camps and to help the victims .
[non-native] for example , there are lots of innovation courses for business and production places .
[non-native] the price of gasoline has gotten higher and higher recently , and the tendency is to be continued .
[non-native] as in nowaday 's intense competition , well-round development also plays a crucial role .
[non-native] now to survive in this battle of fierce competition and outway other one , one can expect the prices of car to be down to such a point that one would not have ever imagined in his or her wildest dreams .
[non-native] young people think that old people are just watching television and travel but also old people try to fight with their illness .
[native] i wonder what kind of precedent that would set if other countries decide that they too want a special deal and threaten with leaving .
[native] yeah , issues like this are heard more because it 's easier to get heard online .
[non-native] is was for they are working and they enjoy explay people about the places they have known and learning .
[native] representation in the senate is sort of arbitrary , but quebec has the same representation as ontario , which is also the same as that of the maritime provinces collectively , and as that of the western provinces collectively .
[native] we can still have european union migrants when we leave .
[native] i love yorkshire , and london , for instance , but i do n't want to be governed by their voters .
[native] you 're so fucking smart why arent you in charge of the world .
[non-native] but they would not let the consumers know exactly how the experiments was conducted .
[non-native] inventing reliable things occurred once in a lifetime but upgrading is possible .
[non-native] so this may even lead to a reason for buying a car as they are very cheap .
[non-native] the policemen , the fire department , and even the medical emergency staff kept away from it .
[non-native] if you ask to people about their best life , most of people answered when they were young .
[non-native] edison , who invented a bulb , is obvious example .
[native] perhaps the best way to handle it would be with something like a striped coloring of the region , but at the moment russia controls crimea and maps should reflect that .
[native] our values and our culture are largely determined by the surroundings we are born into .
[non-native] not to mention that the trains tickets pice will be very low .
[non-native] still their youth is uncertain because everything changes and they also lack of everlasting certainity .
[non-native] in consequence , the numbers of cars will not significatively .
[non-native] an older body can not cope up with the high energy consuming activities unlike the youngerones .
[non-native] and if you understand facts which you will learn more abou the article , it 's make depply for you understand the article .
[non-native] that is to say many people will give up their personal cars .
[native] having a slanted blade instead of a curved blade .
[non-native] but if the objective of your travel is to rest you may go to paradisiatic place with wonderful landscapes , where you are far to the all the peop [ le that can interrup tour rest , in this case you do not need a tour guide because you are the only person that know what yon want to do and palce you want to go .
[non-native] we trust only specialist when it comes to medical treatment .
[non-native] another reason there will be fewer cars in use than today there are todaytoday , the advertisments are a popular and fast way to innunce about the new products .
[native] you can try and find ways to dismiss what i say , but it remains a fact .
[non-native] such a position relies on a few logical arguments , but also on the results of a personal experience , both of which i shall now try to highlight :
[non-native] successful people always have a positive mind and strong mind .
[native] :d your girlfriend ... well , you can always find another .
[non-native] so for these reason i support specializes in one subject is better .so many descotion is trying to prove rather understand ideas and concepts or learning facts is more inportant for the student .
[native] * the irish have a reputation for being fun and welcoming people .
[native] much like the american trope is about `` expanding freedom '' .
[native] last i heard those who receive asylum permit lose it the moment they leave the country they were assigned to .
[native] i 've tried it that way many times and each time it has come back with an error .
[non-native] it depends on the person 's personality , perferences and characters .
[native] looks like that went `` whoosh '' over your head .
[native] could you start a campaign to try to convince them to emigrate to russia ?
[non-native] newspapers , media , printing technology , door to door advertisement and mouth to mouth adverstising has increased substantially in the recent years .
[native] fifa , one of the few organisations more corrupt than the russian government .
[native] like i say , not necessarily directed at you personally .
[native] some videos after : [ 1945 aerials berlin bomb damage ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ban_-qivxx8 ) [ berlin - may 14 , 1945 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp_prwirkmw )
[native] interestingly , crimea is still shown as part of ukraine .
[non-native] it is no doubt that the car is a major part of many peoples lives .
[non-native] i think that you might be asked these kind of questions after you travel somewhere .
[native] [ here 's ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1qmrez/polish_nationalists_celebrated_their_independence/cden9hg ) a great post describing your type .
[native] the groundswell for a brexit simply does n't exist anywhere outside of tabloid headlines and political threats , and by this point most can acknowledge that .
[non-native] tour guides are meant to be hired for people travelling in foreign countries and need a person to guide or lead them .
[native] if you 've ever seen the hitchcock film * the lady vanishes * , it 's set in a small european mountain nation which is exactly as you 've described andorra here .
[non-native] they always want new or interesting products that are different as the others .
[non-native] advertisements actually make products look much different and better than they really are .
[non-native] hence , because of the two examples provided above , i am convinced that most successful people try new things instead of just doing things they already know .
[native] what do you mean `` misusing '' the flag ?
[non-native] this activity want to encourage people stop driving their cars into town because there is no need .
[non-native] we think young people should learn from war-experienced people more than text book . ''
[native] not really , the fundamental power dynamic is the same , the key is to give just enough concessions to make people unwilling to challenge the current system , while retaining power .
[non-native] some others , prefer public means because they are willing to speak with other people .
[non-native] in addition when you are a person who succeed , you have to continue but not to be contented of what you already are .
[native] from a personal standpoint , i had a navy buddy whose ship made a port call in finland and they had to leave early because some locals were harassing black sailors .
[non-native] on the other hand he proved people wrong and one day drove the first carriage with no horses thru his town .
[native] y' know , i really miss the irish banknotes .
[native] true , i agree that fiat money is an incredible strength in this aspect .
[native] first read through it sounded like `` allies of nato ( who are non-nato members ) '' .
[non-native] last years , for example , i saw an ad about shampoo that make the hair nicer .
[non-native] i am currently a student in a competitive high school , and the demand of schoolwork allows me very little free time .
[native] thanks to / u/coramoor _ for pointing that out !
[native] edit : [ as ever uncyclopedia speaks the truth on these issues .
[native] how is canada a member and croatia is not ?
[native] the utter failure of the russian population to exercise and scrutiny of their government , given the history of their state and government , their total immersion in the shameless propaganda of the putin government , and their willingness to send their sons to war while not giving a damn when they return in caskets is an enormous moral failing of the whole of the russian nation .
[native] hell , they could even conscript them into the reserves and tie their benefit to performance .
[non-native] these kind of adertisements became normal and common in these days , even though there are a few copanies say the right things about their products as they seem .
[non-native] creating new things means having risk at the same time .
[non-native] in such a buy-consume-rebuy world advertisements constitutes a great part of our lives even though we are not aware of it .
[native] i 've written about that [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2jsqfv/what_is_so_great_about_ttip/clervs2 ) and why it 's a load of bullshit .
[non-native] it is generally always the same thing with advertisements .
[non-native] however , when the nex time i went to japan with the group led by a tour guide , i had a good time in japan .
[native] i 'm on my phone so ca n't link easily though .
[non-native] i am not so agree with this statement and now i will try to explane why .
[non-native] it is important to clarify that these jumps in all fields come over when there was that speciality in dcademic fields .
[non-native] they are using new techniques which will attract many people .
[non-native] for instance , today , the researchers work on projects which contain lost of subjects because they think that they can only find the result of the problems from the relationship of the subjects , so they want to learn lots of things about the other subjects .
[native] i would like to point out that you can tell your watching your average canadian movie because there will be nudity in it and it will be on the cbc and it will be saturday afternoon
[non-native] if i would like to learn mobile repairing after my graduation i must have some idea about cellular and mobile communications which i have already gone through in my curriculum .
[non-native] the rich man belive that he is going to die 50 years old .
[non-native] but i do n't think they are really serious about the comunity around them .
[non-native] because they know that the world never stops even is known how to turn arround it .some people may think knowing the facts is more important than knowing the ideas and concepts .
[non-native] both young people and old people can enjoy the life , but young people can enjoy life more than the old one .
[native] no one in the world would trust the ukraine with nuclear weapons .
[non-native] in my opinion the problem is that young people in thei free time prefer for example to go to the gym or to go home just to relax , or to go to a pub to have a drink .
[non-native] so know i usually stay with them and simply give them my company or usually i go to the supermarket to buy things they need .
[native] nobody here was going to accuse you of being a paragon of maturity anyways .
[non-native] one of the major point is to put public transport much more available in big cities .
[non-native] successful people usualy get money from their success , and we could think this is crazy to take other risks because you may loose the money you won .
[native] they would thus dislike this news wherever they hear it ( and did . )
[native] not as much as posters on here make out .
[native] everyone that posts on this sub has whipped themselves into a nationalistic fever .
[non-native] i would like to support this statement by giving a personal example .
[native] break * :) brake is pressing on the pedal to stop a car .
[native] there are far more talented programmers and network engineers than myself .
[native] libya , for all the aftermath , is far better off post intervention then iraq , it should be a model for intervention .
[native] english mps are already limited in their powers over scotland , lets not wade in to those waters yet again , also scotland is a lot more similar to england than the uk is to bulgaria or hungary , it 's a whole other scenario which you have to stretch to compare .
[native] all in all , we are n't that good at it .
[native] the reason you have all your ` philosophical ' arguments in the supreme court is either because your legislators wrote shitty law or because your courts overstep their authority .
[native] oh spain , if only you could take the advice of that german woman i met the other day in a madrid group interview : `` southern europeans need to be more disciplined '' .
[native] ca n't even land french planes on our carriers , and i do n't know if the deck if the de gaulle can support the f35 without getting damaged .
[native] and do n't paint other members as an adversary who are forcing britain against her will .
[non-native] all in all , world 's scarce energy stock , car accidents and environmental issues will decrease number of cars in use .
[native] romania 's situation vis-a-vis russia is a whole lot different from an iceland or a scotland ...
[native] the former division between east and west berlin can be seen .
[non-native] advertisers want to sell their product more and more and have to compete with the product of other companies .
[non-native] this leads me to say that it is really important for a student to have a good memory and that is why children have to learn poems by heart .
[native] america is a secular nation , but it 's also one of the worlds most religious .
[native] well , it 's not as if they all live in 5 bedroom mcmansions there with strong building codes ...
[native] latvia has a way to go , both socially and legally , when it comes to the recognition and equality of homosexuals and same-sex couples .
[native] > syria would be `` defending '' itself if it shot down us aircraft right now but they wo n't even consider doing it because they know what will happen if they do .
[non-native] as they get succeeded they think or get ideas of doing more researches and developments .
[non-native] for example , korean government already have a practical policy which makes people prefer public transpotation .
[native] it 's unsurprising football hooligans have n't wised up seeing as they 're about a half a century behind in regards to mentality .
[non-native] second , a lot of more safety cars will be made in twenty years .
[native] the list does n't take into account any of the particulars of any of the countries involved , so catalonia is n't special in this regard .
[non-native] if you ask any old person about what was the best age you enjoy your time ? .
[native] when a company is lobbying , it 's doing it on their behalf .
[non-native] this is the way one can stand in this competetive world with the perfect knowledge in the particular subject , otherwise the person will neither have good knowledge of all the subjects nor will be the master in one .
[non-native] but i think one of the advantages of traveling is to see and touch the local culture or ethnics .
[native] yeah , from ireland too and could n't believe these numbers .
[non-native] advertisement technology is at its peak in this centuary creating ripples in the mind of people by forcing to buy the products thats are of substandards .
[native] a shame because america is the worst retrograde force in the western world at the moment politically speaking .
[native] cue the knee-jerk response of those who 'll try to defend this kind of discrimination : `` it 's not racism if it 's based on nationality . ''
[native] that 's not like france or any other country in the eu .
[native] i 've been to paris a couple times , but i 've spent most of my time traveling around the more eastern countries .
[native] plus , i just do n't think a powerful upper house * ( not saying you would support such , only speaking theoretically ) * could ever exist in the uk * ( or the western world for that matter ) * without a democratic mandate , and i just ca n't see the house of commons willfully sacrificing their authority or endangering it by giving the lords that * ( a all-elected body ) * .
[non-native] so , twenty years down the line , we can look forward for an india , when more half of the indians possess a car .
[native] or is your issue with democracy and transparency of member states as a whole - which seems to be a rather larger issue than just the eu .
[non-native] how can we know that an object have reached its final shape ?
[non-native] there are n't a lot of corageous people but we can see and we have to admit that these people exist and improve our society taking risk .
[non-native] for me , i am living in country side , i can not ride on the bus or train when i want .
[non-native] the first point to support this opinion is the rapid growth of knowledge .
[native] i was earning good money in london , # 10/hour for software engineering , and a weekend in wales cost about # 20 a night .
[non-native] it is therefore possible to convince just by a particular phrase that one thing is good rather than bad .
[non-native] second , in most of young people , they tend to have fun instead of working very hard .
[native] they just are n't as influential as they are in new york , boston etc.
[non-native] it is not a mere transportation vehicle , but it is a part of tradition to drive a car in many countries .
[native] europeans have long apologized for the faults of their colonial endeavours , but because of caliphatism and nationalism , it seems muslim turks are n't going to apologize for forcing their faith on christian communities .
[non-native] in earlier days when there were slow mode of transportation and communication were available .
[native] but how much of this broad overview applies to europe as a whole ?
[non-native] secondly , when you know about the subject in and out , you can always deal with any problem that come across that issue .
[native] i think u/nevinr4 means that the use of `` an '' before `` european union '' soudns wrong ( as opposed to `` a '' ) , not the european union itself .
[non-native] having fun is helpfull but it is more exiting if you get it from your job .
[non-native] in return there is a significant investment in the marketing in order to be sold .
[native] either you are too young to realize this or blindly think think `` competition is better '' while we hollow out all the home grown industry that ever produced something of value in the country .
[non-native] first of all , through developed from different origins , knowleges are intricately connected today .
[native] ] ( http://www.dw.de/with-ttip-eu-and-us-promise-a-transatlantic-trade-miracle/a-17935749 ) ) > * `` and a final issue i have with all these new generation treaties is that corporations gain rights .
[non-native] however , if you are with a travel group , you only get to hang out with that group until you come back home not knowing how the people you visit are like .
[non-native] that people have to take risks is also very good shown by people who are very successful in sports .
[native] how about the union jack in the shape of a dragon ?
[native] let me reaffirm that i do n't blame video games for these kinds of tragedies .
[native] they have to see europe as fitting their dichotomy of the rich and poor , the well off and not so well off and shame on you if you 're one of the rich ones making fun of one of the poor ones .
[non-native] take the case of a thing that one of my neighbor family , having both a teenager member and a grandfather .
[native] it will be the future 's biggest religion , but religion wo n't have the same influence it does today .
[non-native] althoug those concepts will help you to sometimes answer and that is another way of learning .
[non-native] in less than 5 years of gaining supremacy mul faced stiff challange from local manufaturers like tata motors or foreign companies like daewoo , hyundai , general motors , honda etc .
[non-native] students can choose their own specilized subject and build their carrier .
[native] this is why we want things like slaves , money systems , governments , etc.
[native] i should have been more clear that i had issue with the reasoning and not him .
[non-native] i really think that the work is the key of the success .there is growing awarness of car problems all around the world .
[non-native] all the young people only care where can go for play ?
[native] whether it is good or bad to ban these drinks i 'm interested to see if the ban is effective at stopping consumption by minors , having trials like this is very helpful for law making
[native] `` another source of revenue in tonga has been the sale of tongan passports .
[native] wages rises tend not to happen when their is slack in the economy .
[native] yes , verified by one of the most corrupt nations on the planet .
[native] if you just focus on punishment then prisons start to act like breeding grounds for crime , as prisoners inside learn to spread violence and hatred for a world that does not care for them .
[non-native] when a student understands the ideas and concepts that lie behind an observed fact , he really develops his capacity to adapt to different problems and situations .
[non-native] their are many experiments going on now to make the very best battery operated and bio gas cars , which would would become a major resource for growing up the usage of cars in the future .
[native] can you , for once , explain what you want to say and not just link to something ?
[non-native] however , i have to say that most advertisements make the products seem much better than they really are .
[native] crisis-hit eurozone countries have been running to go backwards .
[native] the belief that that shows the `` superiority '' of a more aggressive and dictatorial system is the real existential threat to a peaceful democracy .
[native] sure , eurobonds sounds like a good idea , but how will the money be paid back ?
[non-native] a student can not talk about facts without having a minimum of knowledge .
[non-native] take myself for example , i am 21 and admit i do not give enough hours , but i am not like people i illustrated in the third paragraph .
[native] what should have happened was that post war , similarly to in hong kong , britain finally began to treat the citizens of all colonies with equal rights .
[non-native] and when time passes by and you notice physiological changes within making you weak , you start worrying about a lot of thing to do before you say goodbye .
[native] i was so happy that our nation made those who left to support isis ' passports invalid .
[non-native] as a conclusion i my self disagree that young people enjoy life more that older people .
[native] and it 's been surprisingly peaceful ( in terms of religious conflict ) since the crusades .
[native] it 's obviously the more accurate one , but welcome to politics , the goal is to spin stories to favour you .
[native] i do n't see what they can do about it , it 's unknown whether it 's a mixed-competence agreement , or whether the eu has full jurisdiction .
[non-native] they should be fully known about the fact that happened in the world , not the ideas that what is going to happen .
[native] it works for concerts and sports games but those are also tiered in pricing whereas movies are a flat fee .
[native] but the specifics of this treaty ... it 's a mess .
[native] i ca n't even imagine driving on the right side ... why are non-ex colonies of britain so weird ?
[native] yes , i remember hearing about the bridge plans when i visited in 2003 , and again in 2008 , and again in 2012 .
[non-native] the result of such messages is , then , that young people consider themselves as individuals rather than as parts of a community and that everyone has lost the sense of the community : we basically consider the others as strangers and as a potential danger .
[native] in the uk we have the following legislation : > [ a marriage ( whether or not it is void ) is a `` sham marriage '' if -- .
[native] i 'm sure there would be some parties and viewings of braveheart if it did happen , but the celebrations would be short lived , and the south would remain the same .
[native] it 's hypocritical because the accusation against iceland is that they agreed to pay money if certain conditions arose but when those conditions arose they baulked at doing so .
[non-native] it is important to always have some facts , so that we can make a better analizis to the theory , that involves the ideas and the concepts , analyzing all the things we have in our head , to make a better job .
[native] your comments are `` safe '' :) god loves technology ... > comments are closed to the material in connection with the expiration of its relevance .
[native] the americans , british and french rejected it and demanded complete , unconditional surrender , so it never went anywhere .
[non-native] for example if you are an agricultural product seller and when your neighbourhood becomes more industrialised .
[native] i agree male circumcision should be only done with the personal consent of an adult , but i think the type of mutilation described in the article would require something to make blokes sexually non-functional to be the equivalent .
[native] nah , we just want to come and try to drink all the beer and vodka in riga :)
[non-native] a successful person can start his life fromany adversities he faces utilizing the knowlege he gained by venturing into various diffrent things .
[native] also the expression ` co sie patrzy ' was probably ` nech sa pÃ¡Äi ' , which is basically ` what can i do for you ' in that context .
[non-native] although being honest is an important thing , it is a diffrent issue when it comes to advertisements .
[non-native] therefore many magazines offer testing reports on products of main interest .
[non-native] hence i strongly believe and personally commit to the comment that having specialized in a particular subject fetch excellent and innovative results rather than gaining broad knowledge of many academic subjects .a lot of people are saying that , in twenty years , cars might start disappearing slowly .
[non-native] i could accept easily her suggestion because i was alone .
[non-native] so if the person feel his life is happy , that is the evicence of spending his/her life with happyness and enjoying .
[non-native] he might be thorough in only his concerned subject then he might not get any additional skills towards other subjects .
[native] plus , we used to be capital of england ( well , wessex ) .
[native] what about the rocket fire against israel and the suicide bombings throughout the 90s there .
[non-native] some people even believe that thier is no fun without the risk .
[native] you do realize this is because `` african-american '' is in and of itself a giant ass umbrella term ?
[native] how could a country be so stup ... ... oh .
[non-native] they show a world where everybody is in need of the product , and has no other alternative than using it - they are quite happy with that , by the way .
[non-native] furthermore i think it is more interesting to know little of everthing , you finally know a lot of things that you could always want to know better later in your life .
[native] the west is responsible for creating isreal , we created this whole atrocity , whats going on in asia isnt really our business as much as this is .
[non-native] sometimes innovation and risk-taking is vital to success , at other times it will lead to disaster .
[non-native] normally , successful people try to make or do new things while taking amount of ricks .
[non-native] i feel that it is very important to help one 's community , but when i try to think of examples of such generosity in my fellow students and in younger people , i struggle to find two examples .
[native] the two are pretty much synonymous in english common usage .
[native] they have the most powerful army in the world and they are always abusing their might .
[non-native] some of these activities can be considered not very enjoyable for some other people with different interest .
[native] if it is , then any country could also prevent it going through .
[native] if you start acting as if they do n't , then they do n't - any country has valid grounds for annulling any agreement they have with you on the grounds that you do it .

[non-native] to illustrative this there is an example that is very persuasive .
[native] talking english in your strong regional accent quite quickly to locals who wo n't understand it .
[native] after that , we can start talking to russia about war reparations .

[native] they were smart enough to see that there was n't any infrastructure in place .

[non-native] because , in many family this feeling of constent threat and fear from the human genre was quickly transmited from parents to children .
[non-native] in fact , only few people having the experience about new things and risk can be possible to know the skill , like as `` how to do this dangerous position '' , `` how to manage some risk '' as `` the statistic of the management ability in the dangerous environment . ''

[non-native] i think that this kind of actions mean that we can support an improvement not only giving our time but also giving a financial support , and that we are not indifferent about the topic .

[native] > most importantly t will allow scots to build a better scotland in the long term i agree .
[non-native] for instance , my friend 's grandparents garden and places where famous band concerts performed .
[non-native] after understanding all the reasoning above , it is now safe to say that stating older people 's lives are more enjoyable is a more sagacious and wise action .i agree with the statement wich deals with the importance for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
[non-native] i am a high school student now and i am in the drama club .
[non-native] firstly , when we consider from a point of improvement in the technology many advancements have been made in the field of technology when we deal with the cars of the past they used to give a lesser mileage than the sophisticated and welly improvised cars of today offer .
[non-native] but i disagree with considering it as a best way to travel .
[native] > i did n't downvote because i disagree > i downvoted because you are wrong that is the definition of disagreement , mate .
[non-native] the above example clearly states , what would be the advantage of specialization and with that of knowledge about many subjects .
[non-native] so it 's essential for a student to manage the ideas and concepts of a topic of study , to be capable of completely understanding everything about it and to work correctly with its facts .
[native] do n't waste your time , the vast majority of subscribers here are close-minded and unwilling to engage in a constructive argument .
[non-native] advertisements use scientific explanation to make us buy them .
[native] it is for a specific kind of interpersonal relationships .
[native] eh , that 's the fault of people not taking enough participation in democracy , not of democracy in itself .

[native] not sure if letterman was mixing up the divide within northern ireland and mistakenly thinking it was between ireland and northern ireland .

[non-native] i do agree that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years .
[native] if there is a god , it 's trying to kill him but now he 's got a friggin pig heart or some such and likely takes shots of fetal stem cells .
[non-native] in conclusion , i think it is much better to specialize in one specific academic subject than many different ones because it makes one concentrate more on what is personally important and therefore lets one view what is around in a different and better way .nowadays the burden placed on the youth is indeed much heavier than that on the previous generations .
[non-native] the house is very dirty inside , when you step outside you can find dog 's excrements everywhere .
[non-native] however , for some the idea to not use the car is somethings unrealistic and unbelievable .
[native] i have seen only diagonal flags though , have you seen horizontal ?
[non-native] therefore if one advertisement insists on the velocity of a car it may not speak about safety because this is not a important characteristc of the car .
[non-native] they always made them look better than what they really were .
[native] this could be seen as a ` third way ' , between using the euro and issuing a new currency .
[native] if ukraine had nuclear weapons , i think we can all agree it would have been much less likely for russia to invade one could also point to the ease in which the us went into iraq and yet has still done absolutely nothing to north korea , a nation who has directly opened fire at one of their closest allies several times .
[non-native] i belive that young generation actively participate in the functioning of the community .
[native] basically everyone not in the eurozone handled the crisis much better .
[non-native] at first , i want to point out my personal opinion : i do completely agree with the statement at hand .
[non-native] consequently , helping one 's community is not a thing most young people pay particular attention to , because they are overly concerned with much more `` important '' issues .i 'm totally agree with this statement .
[non-native] so , even if the developed countries would reduce their reliance on cars , the number of cars would actually increase .
[native] i expect a lot of students would just lean on their [ european health insurance card ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_health_insurance_card ) and fudge how long they 're staying in the country when they visit the doctor , at least for most health issues .
[native] as far as i can tell traffic laws are n't really enforced .
[native] a company is just a bunch of people as well , it 's shareholders .
[non-native] on the other hand , young people feel that they ever do n't die and because of this reason they do n't aware the value of life .
[native] while open borders is a nice idea , i do n't think the uk would be able to adapt infrastructure quick enough for the inward flow of immigration .

[native] a solid , cohesive geographical majority got the government they wanted .
[non-native] on the other hand , there are a big and powerful industry which will make hard to abandon the systems based on fossil fuels .

[native] russians have been feeling humiliated and unrespected since the collapse of the soviet union , which explains why they 're willing to follow putin 's mad gambles , maybe even into the abyss .
[non-native] on one hand , the enviromental problems and future supply shortage are pushing governments to face the transportation problems in different ways .
[native] the kurds have - for all intents and purposes - set themselves up a rudimentary state there , so i fail to see why they 'd let some people that none of them know start fighting for them all of a sudden .
[non-native] it is very important to been remembered to customers to develope the sales .
[non-native] in this instance , let 's consider an example , if we presume a student who is concentrating in only one subject , consider political science .
[native] > imo it 's pretty ridiculous to think the 2-state solution is a suitable permanent deal .
[native] but it makes it much easier to get closer to the point where the frog will be cooked .

[native] i fully agree that european continental politics are germany/france .
[non-native] one can finsh so many daily activities and save time by having a car .
[non-native] ultimately , i believe that old people enjoy life more than younger people do .
[non-native] from above reasons , i agree with the satement that young poeple enjoy life more than old people do .i do agree with the statement that it is very much important for the students to understand the ideas and concepts rather than to learn facts .

[native] you might enjoy this [ wonderful ukrainian military ad ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyx7kvetflo ) then .
[non-native] moreover , there are very few people in history who have dedicated their lives to many things , like for example leonardo da vinci , who was an overall inventor , artist , investigator and doctor , but we can also say that he was really a eye-opener in a time where people needed to know and discover many things about the world they lived in .

[native] > their in this context , the correct spelling is `` there '' .
[non-native] these commercials give the false impression that once the products are being used , the consumers will become like those in the ad .
[non-native] by the way , a friend of mine understand only ideas , i mean , he works only with his memory .
[non-native] also it is a sign of wealth in many countries to own a car in many countries , such as china .
[native] on a quick note , and this is something i see with a lot of people , do n't be so sensitive .
[native] from * the socialist revolution and the right of nations to self-determination * ; > victorious socialism must achieve complete democracy and , consequently , not only bring about the complete equality of nations , but also give effect to the right of oppressed nations to self-determination , i.e. , the right to free political secession .
[non-native] they have to face problems when they get started with job .
[native] until that 's agreed upon , taxpayers are still ultimatly footing the bill .
[non-native] battery powered cars have been manufactured which are eco friendly .
[native] of course tensions against the west inflamed after afghanistan and iraq , but to think that it 's solely a result of this intervention , when there were plenty of islamist attacks in the 90s and earlier in the 20th century shows that at the core , it 's an ideological problem .
[non-native] but once a person chooses a field in which he is interested and specializes in it he would astutely know of what to do and the shouldnt 's in that particular field of specialization .

[native] much better than my family ( they genuinely think that immigrants are the root of all evil , and should be denied even the most basic of human rights , at the whim of theresa may ; they then wonder why none of my ( mostly foreign ) friends feel comfortable around them ) .
[non-native] these all come from the dearth of attention and care .
[non-native] this is actually what a lot of advertisements do .
[native] immigration into this country has been massively beneficial but with a tabloid culture ; rather than listening to economic scientists with an established lack of motivational bias , the actual data at hand and the necesarry skilset to interpet that data , they 've been coerced by that snake in the grass , farage that it is n't their fault , that they 're hard-working britons who deserve better and it 's actually the political elite shipping in cheap labour and those filthy polacks who are to blame .
[non-native] if you want to be a succesful person you should definetely take risks to survive and go on life .in my opinion it is more important for students to uderstand ideas and concepts rather than learn facts .
[non-native] advertising meke you buy carsar as cars are concerned , i think that the only opportunity to diminuish them is to invent a new moder technology , in order to replace cars .
[non-native] their social activities and sport activies more or less follow the same patterns .
[native] if you think squirrel is hard ... the german word `` rechts '' is what gets me ...
[native] but what it actually means is `` allies of the us who are not members of nato '' .
[native] `` when external threats arise '' which external threats are you referring to ?
[non-native] therefore , knowing the concepts can not be ingored .
[non-native] we physically help them through laying and cutting bricks and digging ground .
[native] you also got your vote and had a loooonnnggg time to discuss and campaign and had a simple yes or no vote , many countries would think that completely insane .
[non-native] so at one point or another most people have to make a decision between the amount of knowledge to gather , and the time and money they got to do this .
[non-native] for example every present engineer other than computer science students also should have atleast some knowledge about the computer even though it is not present in their syllabus in the university , as it is necessary for lot of needs like applying jobs on line and also for the communication purpose etc .
[native] i wonder how it all went so down hill .
[native] portugal is a small island nation off the right side of africa .
[native] at least in the uk ( the country that seems to complain about it the most ) , it 's not a problem except for a media manufactured one .

[non-native] as an instance , in my country a candy brand called ulker made an advertisement in which there was a quote saying that `` you can forget its name , but never its taste . ''
[non-native] as , we are living in a fast paced world where information is passed at high rate and we are rapidly becoming a residant of a global village .
[native] the only two that seemed to be any good were karavan out of town and moct city centre , they were at least busy and full of stores .
[native] well , america does have a pretty severe obesity crisis .
[non-native] so be an intelligent buyer and make smart choices , never buy anything by just seeing the ad but buy only when u have reseached about it and are convinced to go for it .advertisements play a very vital role in sales of various products .
[non-native] one reason may be that they are not strong enough to move around at that age or may be they have enough spent their time outside during their young age .
[native] but they 're not the same as the hardcore militant extremists who live in that warzone , have been air-raided their whole lives , have no education , and have committed those horrific acts of violence for the world to see .
[native] ( based on a true story ) you should check it out , its dope .
[native] there are plenty of sane comments but it 's striking the quantity and popularity of the comments which paint the eu as the soviet union .
[non-native] but there are many things that we can not learned from only one subject , we will not have the ability to deal with those things .
[native] you let them in and they 're part of germany .
[native] i do n't know how they 'd maintain it though .
[non-native] nevertheless , young people 's lives can be more enjoyable to some extent , such as a higher energy level they obtain in their daily lives , but this merit is speculative .
[native] let 's face it - the countries/cities that are interested in hosting the olympics are interested because they have insufficient modern infrastructure in the first place .
[non-native] actually , many people have language problem , and it could be serious problem .
[non-native] besides , their priorities lie on studies , parties and some other aspects of life that do not include their communities .
[non-native] first of all , by having broad knowledge of many academic subjects you will be a well round-educated person and have alot of skills that you can use in your daily life .
[native] the estonian government will cut a deal to get their guy back while the informant goes on a long vacation to siberia .
[native] these credit booms did not come out of nowhere .
[non-native] in fact most teacher of my university tell that during the study we should prefer the specific knowledge and often , in the working world , we can broad our knowledge .i completely agree with the statement you have made .
[non-native] one way , he will be pleased that he is parcticing what he likes and he will not feel bored , which is the major cause of lack at work .
[non-native] just imposing studying will never make the person reach the the higest goel .
[non-native] i do n't want to pay waste money , and i want to decide by myself .i do n't think that this statement is correct .
[native] most of these are ridiculous if you know more than a few words in the languages , and are generally ethnically/politically motivated rather than based on any linguistics .
[native] `` anatolians '' have never been recorded as living in constantinople .
[non-native] last sunday , i ran into tomohisa kamimura , a member of that kyoto tour , at the tokyo station .
[non-native] for example , the person to try to new things and take risks can prospect and see the different field with his or her experience .
[native] that way youtube can confirm that the email address and license number match the organization that is requesting the dmca .
[native] russia needs the eu as a customer more than the eu needs their supply .
[native] * no , no no property bubble to be seen here * forgive me for being skeptical , plus when does the us ever go more than 7 years without some sort of bubble bursting .
[non-native] when defining success and how it is obtained one realises that different methods and many underlying factors take a toll on the general outcome of any ordeal .
[non-native] however the given statement hold good for some contentions , for example , if a successful people trying any thing means they are so much familiar regarding that thing because without knowing that thing they will not take the risk and they will go in that way only what they know better is .
[native] we 're also known for being the centre of the church of england .
[non-native] second of all , the cars are so danger .
[native] also , in another sense , the thing is that north korea * is * an isolated country .

[native] you should 've finished your post instead of editing it in afterwards .
[native] you would need to spend about 18 % of your gdp to match russian spending .
[non-native] firstly , success is something like not to be done by everyone , in opposite you can say that reading is a success , but nowadays it is not because everybody can read .
[non-native] the fact is written and it does n't change .
[native] when comparing militaries , you need to look at other factors too .
[native] i want my grandpa back ... . . please ?
[native] their laws will have to be better because they will be held to a higher standard than previously .

[non-native] we donated the money to children 's cancer foundation .
[non-native] nowadays , the work of young people for their community , though certainly changed in its organization , looks much more effective ( also due to technological progress ) and genuinely driven by the will of helping other people than before .
[native] and anyone second-guessing the fed or trying to bet against qe got burnt badly .
[native] of all the european countries i have been to , my favorite was norway .
[non-native] perhaps the only sport i can think of is yoga .
[native] the only reason you want to frame this as such is so that you can go on to ridicule a straw man .
[native] hell , signs there are often monolingual russian , and the official belarus government website is russian first , with a `` belarusian version '' link at the top .
[non-native] as a result it can be really rewarding , as salaries of this people or so called subject experts will be sky high .
[native] serious question : do people in europe think that americans actually ever saw `` freedom fries '' ?
[native] and i guarantee you that we 'll see virtually no improvement in the water infrastructure .
[non-native] for exapmle , we can see all the trash near our communities and there are no one to pick it up .
[non-native] i am studiing in mantova , a little city near modena .
[non-native] there is korean saying that `` if the food looks good , it makes taste great . ''
[native] there are a lot of people on here that are young , and do n't understand nuance .
[native] i 'm actually pretty surprised so many go to poland .
[non-native] in germany the social sector wouldn'y be able to survive without these `` zivildienstleistende '' , the guys who do n't want to go to the army .
[non-native] for a example , old people , young people and childrens are all living in this communities .
[native] > the drafts are leaked that 's not correct .
[non-native] the attachment to cars by the human society and the possiblity to alter cars to better suit the needs of the environment and the people , make me conclude that the usage of cars will not decline in twenty years .get a acadamic knoweladge
[native] my ex was a nuclear engineer who now works for areva .
[native] the war is now a sectarian clusterfuck but it started in response to the murder of peaceful protesters by assad .
[native] straight people do n't get it , they do n't see how absolutely everything in society , media , and culture just screams `` straight '' , and how much that impacts us .
[native] what 's to say these were russians and not some false flag operation ?
[non-native] indeed , with the passing of time , the meaning of life starts to change .
[native] it and many similar calibers are available to buy in europe and the uk too .

[native] > since isds tries to establish a protective layer above any national or currently available eu level which also is n't available to the ordinary citizen , the `` usefulness '' ( as the doc uses the term , leaving the citizen 's viewpoint completely out of the game ) is there but only for the party aiming for mentioned profits .
[non-native] whearas , old people should think many times before getting into any adventure because the society is watching out what mistakes they might do .
[non-native] whereas a broad knowledge of many subjects refers to the ideal of humanism which has been supported for a long time and partially is still being supported , specialization is a phenomena of modern time .
[non-native] and best of all , share all this with the company you have !
[non-native] i mean the manufacturing of the vehicles such as cars buses which carry people one place to another and occupy the roads .
[non-native] if it is a community with diverse religions with frequent quarrels between the religions of the community then it is very difficult to get together the youngsters of the community to work for a single cause that is to work for a single community .
[non-native] i think it is quit enough when someone also do only a half hour or less every day for the community .
[non-native] he knows his own skills and how to use them ; and he is also aware about his weaknesses already .
[native] in a democracy the people governing the state is chosen by the people , limiting immigration because it is changing the overall culture in a way that the majority of people do n't like is just democracy .
[native] yes , but the article makes a good point : what happens if the primary components of a product are produced in one country , but assembly ( often where quality is determined ) is done in another ?
[non-native] but they already were walking shoes and well i did n't run through a nightmare .
[non-native] the late owner used to run a tea stall in a small town .
[native] look at the many successful countries in the world not in the eu .
[native] my personal opinion is that europe needs this boost far more than the us does right now .
[non-native] i did not know where i should go and what the good food i can eat .
[native] no politician uses the religious card etc but yet still new zealand is culturally christian .
[non-native] anyway , i 'm curious how the means of transport will evolve during the next years .i agree with this statement that said `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they alreary know how to do well . ''
[native] american tactical nukes in theatre , especially in both germany & your own country , also give russia pause to think before using tactical nukes .
[native] i do n't support their twisted racist sexist pedophile religion , but i do support their right to practice and share their beliefs like everyone else gets to .
[native] him and louise bours are damaging ukip 's image .
[native] given the current lack of stimulus and wide spread tax evasion , this could provide a useful tool to solve two problems at once .
[native] so you 're telling me i have a shot ?
[native] so does the american constitution , but that never stopped the states .
[non-native] however , in my opinion this can not be true in terms of ...
[native] i find it pretty funny that you think you 've got it all figured out better than the thousands of engineers and technocrats who have been working of this for decades .
[non-native] if i felt this car is cool as well as expensive one , i try to buy it .
[native] how a bill becomes law : [ english chart ] ( http://www.parl.gc.ca/content/lop/researchpublications/images/prb0864_app-e.gif ) , [ french chart ] ( http://www.parl.gc.ca/content/lop/researchpublications/images/prb0864_app-f.gif )
[native] that 's just my observation though , not sure if that 's really how it is .
[non-native] but i believe that what makes a person different and gifted than the other people is his or her resolution and the undying belief in what one 's doing .firsteval , it is important to remind that , usualy , successfull people are people with habilities and knowledges in specific fields .
[native] i 've seen lots of references to it in el paÃ­s , but do n't understand what it refers to very well .
[non-native] they run a variety of projects - from helping kids to do their homework in the afternoons to supporting the poor by handing out daily portions of freshly cooked food .
[native] to add insult to injury we spend our whole lives coming out , every knew person , new workplace , new neighbourhood means plucking up the courage to come out , always unsure of the reaction and consequences .
[non-native] i think that the govern and the citizen af all the word have to cry to obtain this .
[native] i honestly rarely see religion taken up in this argument .
[native] this will however be the last time i respond to something you say about this subject .
[native] 1840s was when irish people spread across the world .
[non-native] to organize such a event you need a lot of people and everybody helps to make this possible again , year after year .
[native] well it 's ironic because the ship is named independence , as in independence from russia .
[native] replacing the uk 's contribution would cost each of the remaining 27 countries an extra $ 277 million annually .
[non-native] the second reason is that the companies may not have enough time and procedures to differentiate between the good one and bad one .
[non-native] i made that experience as well when i was learning for my exam .
[native] in the eu parliament this just does n't happen .
[non-native] and it is not an easy task for you because you have learn from the beginning .
[non-native] and these have been proved through analysis of the last 2-3 years in most of the the parts on the world .
[non-native] for example , i met and got to know some older people here in canada after coming from my home country .
[native] i definitely learnt more in my first month or so in germany than i did in the 2 years before going !
[native] in other words everything will be mostly the same but will be called something else .
[non-native] in fact , once the consumer finds out that the product is not as it was pictured in the advertisement , if he has come a long way to buy the product , he will most likely purchaise it .
[native] people might be interested about his biases or from what ideological position he 's coming from .
[native] if you accept that there should be laws on immigration , do n't you think that there should also be laws to ensure that marriage should not be used as a technique to artificially get round immigration laws ?
[native] you 're not smarter than everyone else for ` figuring it out ' .
[native] sorry , i am not from europe ( i 'm from new zealand ) , but thank you so so much for the bbc .
[native] sometimes , people like to remind other people that canada exists .
[native] but it would n't be starting anew , would it ?
[native] > its differentiating features amplified to the max ( because america ) it 's say this is more of a feature of large expat communities , not necessarily that they are in the us .
[native] they 're still bickering over hormone grown beef , a process which started years ago .
[non-native] i desagree with the statement , because the facts are important as the ideas and concepts , the are connect because the ideas and concepts give the students the facts , they are always behind , in any explication and understanding of ideas and concepts , we have to consider the facts , to have a deeper reasoning about what we want to learn , but why some people not consider facts as important ?
[non-native] further more , the attitude plays a huge part in this particular situation .
[native] banking union is not designed for the debts of the irish financial sector in 2008 and irish banks under banking union will not ( i understand ) be able to be so over-geared and under-capitalised as they were in 2008 exactly because of this ...
[non-native] moreover , in france , we can notice that the cost of the petrol is very important and we arrive to a point that we can say that it 's a luxe to have a car as the petrol is expensive .
[native] the best thing he could do was still a shit result , but it sounds and feels a lot better than a 1.7 bn shit on your doorstep for christmas .
[native] when has any power been moved from the eu level back to nation states ?
[native] canada is actively working to reduce its reliance on the usa .
[native] the warship was in response to numerous violations by the spanish police boats coming in to gibraltar 's waters , spain was doing this to win some political points and maybe seem a bit tough , they also slowed down the border crossing just to piss people off .
[non-native] and to fell happy there are a lot of reasson .
[native] i still find it far more nuanced > the average uneducated and unskilled ukip supporter feels a strong dislike for continentals if not worse .
[native] > we are living the most peaceful times of humanity , so , embrace it .
[native] third , the leaks showed that ttip was using a positive list for market access , and a negative list for national treatment .
[non-native] here i am not talking about success , i am talking about happiness and according with my own thoughts and ideas , happiness connect success and success people is happy .i agree with the statement ` young people do not give enough time to helping their communities . '
[non-native] two types of studies leads you faster to the job you ever dreamed of
[non-native] in order to make the product we must know the knowledge of our academic subjects .
[non-native] finally for surviving in this competitive world , for doing good reasearch , we need to know lot of concets .
[native] to the uk ) and there has n't been a public outrage .
[non-native] therefore i think to understand ideas and concepts are more important than to learn facts .ideas are caused by thinking intensely or doing indepth research about any particular subject .
[non-native] learning facts are more essential than to understand these facts .
[non-native] there are mainly two ways of education : one way that allow students to understand by themselves theories , concepts or ideas by different means such as scientific experiences or self thinking and a second way that provide to them all teachings without real understanding .
[non-native] the other subject can give us an idea about our subject because they may have a relation .
[native] that 's why it 's best to compare similar sized economies .
[non-native] for example , my parents enjoys their life with using more money than it used to be .
[non-native] most of people always doing things that they already know how to do will .
[native] whereas one could reliably predict what the us and europe will look like in 50 years time , the same is not true of russia , nor , for that matter , china .
[non-native] but very often , consumers do n't really get what they expected after purchasing the product by just looking at their ads .
[native] china as a nation has existed for thousands of years ( though not without changing boundaries and changing rulers/dynastys ) many other european countries have existed with their borders and peoples largely unchanged for hundreds of years - sweden , france , denmark , portugal , spain etc.
[native] a nations history shapes the education and social policy of the nation becoming part of the nations culture .
[non-native] finally , advertisements are necessary for companies to sell their products .
[non-native] for them , it 's all a win-win situation in terms of more skills , responsibility and work load in the same cost as for a specialized person .
[non-native] next , understanding idea and concepts are remained stude n't memory longer than just learning .
[non-native] however , specialisation in a particular subject also invariably happens at a later stage in college or university .
[native] i 'm simply saying that they would use them if they needed to , as is the whole purpose of having a nuclear weapon .
[native] a number of us states already mandate that tipped and non-tipped employees get paid at least the minimum wage ( $ 9 ) , and you end up with much better service as a result .
[native] i 'm an irish ex-pat and to be honest every time i visit there i see things going more and more backwards .
[non-native] so , we decided to go to the agencies , where cars would be sold , to talk to the salespeople there and to get catalogs with detailed information on every single aspect .
[non-native] but the quickness or speeds are not only consisted of the joyful of football .
[non-native] hence they are made in a way that makes the product seem much better than the product actually is .
[non-native] i strongly believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject , because people can do it .
[native] i just fired this into google translate so apologies if it 's hard to follow : > serbia aleksandar vucic refused to sign the protocol governing the payment of a debt for russian gas by march next year , in the amount of approximately $ 200 million .
[native] though i suppose its hard to formulate a plan .
[native] however , ideally the power of the people and the will of the people should be expressed in the voting booth , rather than through vandalism ...
[native] usually if someone sends me a link with sources , i click on the sources .
[non-native] another reason that comes readily to mind is that older people definitely treat their lives as more precious thing than young people .
[non-native] at finally he can achieved the independence of his country .
[non-native] thomas eddison the most successful inventor of all times , work hard throught his live .
[non-native] what can young people do for community in that huge lackness hole ?
[native] i guess you 'd also be fine with doing away with the needless expense that is the justice system , given you 've been absolutely fine with ( and even gleeful of ) extrajudicial killing in northern ireland .
[native] eh , like i said , a small beer with lunch is fine .
[native] yeah i think it 's been pretty clear to everyone the uk is an oddities compared to the rest of europe .
[non-native] i can use the mathmethic knowledge to real problem .
[non-native] there are numbers reasons to support this , but in the following passage i will only present the major ones .
[native] dublin is generally disliked by the rest of the country because it 's the major population center and hub of political/economic activity .
[non-native] so , i always understand the concept and ideas in any subject rather then giong by a fact .
[non-native] from that day , i do n't believe the recipets i took in my class .
[native] in hindsight , yes , some success was to be expected .
[native] russia is becoming less and less relevant by the day .
[native] we can not just simply be passive about such matters , europe and scandinavia have been a combination of both passive and too far politically correct for too long .
[non-native] we can say that successful people are kind of lucky people .
[non-native] in space programme we are using mathematics , statistics , physics , aeronautics etc . ..
[non-native] and they dont have any motivation which forces them to devout some of their effort for the well being of their community .
[non-native] from the above examples we can conclude that successful people always try new things and those things make these people unique from others .
[non-native] second , the tour guide know the place very well .
[native] multinational companies will have to pay minimum wages to their employees while they are in the host country .
[non-native] the old peole cant judje them becuse they are young .
[non-native] they did not have a enough money and did not free time .
[native] my point was that religious freedom in europe was a twofold process - the reformation provided an alternative to catholicism , and the enlightenment and the secular principles it generated for governing the realms allowed the expression of differing ideas and religious practices .
[non-native] this shows that how people are realising the importance of pollution .
[non-native] for example , if someone only likes learning about nature or animals and so decide to be teached only this subject , he will not be able to have a political discussion or an history discussion because he will have learned only one subject .
[non-native] but exist different way to applicate them : for example for a kid at the primary schol , maybe it 's better to understand ideas and concept , because he is at the start of his study career , so he need every strument to grow up well .
[non-native] in paris , the mayor has rendered certain parts of the city difficult to access by car .
[non-native] in addition to that the governement of my country try to sensibilize citizens to the fact that cars pollute a lot and it is very bad for the environement .
[native] about five-sixths ireland has been self-governing since 1922 , a republic since 1937 and out of the commonwealth since 1949 .
[non-native] the atmosphere is no longer as clean as before due to the huge amount of wasted gas that cars have produced .
[native] in town there was ` europe ' on the main square where the shops were always empty .
[non-native] i agree with the statment because of some valid reasons which are stated below .
[non-native] in other way a lot of people especially in poor country do n't even seen a car or maybe so rarely .
[native] mostly because i do n't have to be there .
[native] i like earl grey because it 's kind of sweet by itself .
[non-native] in fact more and more people have a disease , owing to the pollution and it 's difficult to heal .
[non-native] some years before it was absolutly full of cars and noise .
[non-native] getting the topic understant by concepy really help them to score good marks an percentage in their college .
[non-native] the same occurs as a student in highschool or at the university , meeting new people , sharing with them and all the things around it are very exiting .
[native] so how is it suppose to work , though ?
[native] it should start off at a low rate , even as low as a few thousand a year , and slowly increase over time so the effects of it can be tracked and forecast .
[non-native] so , older people can enjoy more than young people when doing something costs a lot .
[non-native] my teacher told us that we are going to research and think about the choreography if we try new things , which in this case a choreography .
[native] info from `` lenta '' are on the scale of `` ny post '' , same goes to readers x and readers y
[non-native] nowadays things are getting faster and more is being expected .
[non-native] a person who invents a new kind of product and who is the first to introduce it to the market will be successful in selling this product at a high price and will make profits if customers like this product .
[non-native] when we travel in the group , we can meet many people who we never have met before .
[non-native] taking highway engineering into consideration , its totally distinct from other fields as it deals with pavement design and harbour design .
[native] it 's supposed to be market leading purchases to immediately affect supply and a promise to act whenever it feels the price is too high .
[native] i 'm fairly sure the commission does not have the power to levy a charge .
[non-native] due to this many people are suffering from diseases .
[non-native] actually , i assume that young people are the most concerned with this problem but i will speak about this later .
[non-native] but he said you are worry , the book is write by people , people always worry , you should understand the ideas from the book , not just follow the book and learn facts , at the begin , i think he is fool , how can i understand ideas from the book ?
[non-native] we can see there is no one to heip old people cross the stree .
[native] ( which costs # 4 for half a pint )
[native] i know that he 's not going to be popular with everyone , but at the very least the man did great things for people with disabilities and accessibility by making true touchscreen devices that worked well and were affordable .
[non-native] but what is the truth , maybe it is a very bad product .there is no denying that whether young people enjoy their lives more than the older people do has become controversial , not only to professionals , but also to the public as a whole .
[non-native] it helps somebody to keep fit and it 's good for their health .
[non-native] using car will be more unsecure due primarily to increasing number of fatal car accidents .
[native] my whole point is you are not going to get anywhere in the world by having nothing to offer it besides a tax cut or `` patent box '' i 've better spelled that out in my reply to another poster here http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2l9c34/ireland_set_to_become_fastestgrowing_eu_economy/cltl2k3
[non-native] in that times , no one know window is much useful for people , and can change people life .
[non-native] every one wants a piece of this cake , there is no shying back .
[non-native] this has so many other implciations on that persons daily routine .
[native] the political situation has changed in the uk and the reu since juncker said those words : the political and economic situation will develop further in unforseeable ways over the coming couple of years .
[non-native] this brings people to actually try these products , because people are so desperate to buy anything that would help them to lose weight .
[native] all we usually see in the media are distraught moderate parents of children who 'd been radicalised and gone off to war , but we 'd be kidding ourselves to think support for is in europe goes no deeper than a few , isolated , angry young men .
[non-native] in this context , we must admit that the only reason for success is training .
[native] the gas is turned into a liquid in the gas producing country through a combination of pressure and extreme temperatures , transported via ship , and then regasified at this ship and transported to the mainland .

[native] so if you were to ask what the most significant university was , then it would be the eighteen universities comprising the university of london .
[native] yeah i just checked the tone of what i said ; what irritates me is the uks negotiating style and lack of positive contribution to the future of europe .
[native] how is it possible that uk natives * negatively * contributed # 600 billion ?
[native] certainly i agree that we should be taking a firmer stance against putin now but your claim that the west is in bed with them is preposterous .
[native] for example , how many people actually support this or why it 's a hot button now .
[native] no , but i am representative of some of the people who vote for ukip , which is what this discussion is about .
[native] with the kosovo/albania ties this stuff is still a current issue for many , not one of the past .
[non-native] old people always waste their lite by reading books .
[native] i 'd probably throw it in with mixed feelings if i was doing other countries .

[native] its up to the people in the north to sort out their shit between themselves .

[non-native] these dynamic people are really paying alot in terms of their service to the humanity .
[native] but a politician coming out , especially in the east , will get blow back , not matter the timing .
[native] my time is valuable , i 'm not going to waste it reading another one of your poorly sourced , heavily biased , and misinterpreted links .
[non-native] since that they try to do anything to show their items as they want .

[native] the isds claims do n't happen just of they 're adversely affected , but happen if foreign companies are adversely affected by government acts done in bad faith and which unfairly damage foreign companies over domestic ones .
[native] american politicians love to forget that , seems like the people do as well .
[non-native] when you see those tv spots , you would find irresistable for those products .

[non-native] it is a shame that being a consumer is getting harder because there are too many advertisements present their products in the most attractive ways .
[native] geographically , perhaps , but culturally russians have much more in common with their mongol ancestors .
[native] i 've done all of those things and have done management .
[native] as for `` for what purpose '' , it would be helping very hard-up european consumers have more money in their pockets to have a better life .
[native] there are mass graves in donetsk of anyone who disagrees with the `` government '' there .
[native] is it just because they compile it from so many different sources ?
[native] i 'm culturally a franco-germanic-celt , and feel more comfortable in europe .
[native] and the nineteenth century was n't stable for europe - it started with the napoleonic wars and ended with the franco-prussian .
[native] so that justifies killing him and the hundred in parliament on that day despite being a good and fair ruler ??
[non-native] because if an individual go for tain or bus as hios means of travelling than he or she has to wait for the train or bus until it comes and he or she can visit only those places where the bus or train can go .
[native] quebec was going to do that very thing in 1995 .
[native] the soviet union really bastardized socialism in a lot of ways and it just became an extension of russian imperialism .
[non-native] that is the reason why many corporate companies have restricted their workers to continue beyond an age of 55 in most of the countries .
[native] what would dota 2 do with 80 % of it 's population gone d :

[native] these people are n't disenfranchised because of corporations lobbying .
[non-native] it 's not given to anyone to succeed in making new things .
[native] is n't it more like : banks must now make money only when there is a clear agreement between them and customers .
[non-native] as a good example , when i and my friends visited kalahasti one of the most important place in indai , we dont know any thing about that palce , just we got few directions about the palce like where to stay and how to go to places .
[native] but there 's also opportunity for the established powers to try and bring propaganda or control of the channels of communication ( the net neutrality issue ) to the internet , like they had used traditional mass media ( tv , radio , newsprint ) modes of communication for .
[native] however you can call him `` a piece of shit '' without calling him racist epithets like a `` monkey '' .
[native] my guess is they will become matured bonds , i.e.
[native] whether there 's two parties or ten , there is no choice over huge amounts of policy thanks to the eu imperial monolith .
[native] yet we get thrown to the back of the visa queue whilst * anybody * from slovakia or lithuania or some country most brits have never heard of go in visa-free .
[native] > i think you are putting to much importance into those words , juncker had to say something at that point , but i do n't think they mean what you think they mean nor do i actually think that junker even if he 's honest about it has the power to pull any such changes through the pe or the council .

[native] irish here , was never tought about israel in ` pre-school ' or primary , learned about it in secondary in religion class .
[non-native] this will be possible because a wrong political way hes been gotten ( i am talking about my particular country situation ) .
[native] the point is that in the uk , for example , and any western european country afaik anyone sending a message like this would be liable to prosecution .
[non-native] even though it usually has a high possibility of failure , it is worth to try to explore new ideas , and generally successful people are people who have obtained a solution by new things without failing .
[non-native] but acutually if you eat them , you would get mad against the cooker .
[non-native] that 's also why we learn philosophie in school , to learn to doubt , to think and analize .
[native] in the past seven years this has produced $ 30 million for tonga as well as a constitutional crisis .
[native] i mean in theory the central government could dissolve the regional governments .
[non-native] for all old people they must have taken a young period and enjoy it .
[non-native] in addition to that , only companies with a great amount of money are able to start commercials .
[non-native] so i think it is better to first concentrate on one subject and to get to know everything possible about it , get a job by using that knowledge and try to broaden your horizon afterwards .
[native] your opinion will never be taken seriously on / r/europe again , fella .
[native] take a look at the text in the top right .
[non-native] there are many advanatges for both methods that i have to take in consideration when i plan to travel and especially when i plan to make a touristic tour to a certain country .
[native] this is why i think it 's now or never for a grand bargain that is balanced , but hey i 'm sure it looks a bit different from the other side of the pond .
[native] so what is your concern regarding the eu political structure ?
[native] not catalonia ) problem and that catalonia would be free of such corruption were it to secede .
[native] hurting an animal in public here is one of the few things that could get you lynched .
[native] how is converting to an dead , unused currency useful in any way ?
[native] that is the truth and if you do n't see it then too bad .
[non-native] a doctor has 5 years of academic time to study and master all the things about the human body and a biologist has around 3-4 years to study about all the animals .
[native] so they knew the worlds eyes were on them , unloaded the weapons , and couldnt just turn them around as they would lose face .
[native] do some research and get some facts before you start talking shit .
[non-native] man is very much dependent on cars which forms his basic means of locomotion without which he can not dream of going out .
[native] nothing serious , just shit that made me cringe .
[non-native] in addition , learning a wide range of different knowledge will fulfill our daily lives .
[non-native] even if i strongly believe in what i have written above , last week i was simply too influenced by an advertisement seen on a tv and i bought the product advised therein .
[native] europe is not going to be conquered externally any time in the foreseeable future .
[non-native] millions of money spent for the adverstisement can be diverted towards the maintainance of the stanndars fo the product .
[native] that 's honestly not far off the average sydney beer price .
[non-native] they are master strategists , skilled in various business aspects - finance , accounts , engineering , general management ( a course quite popular in b-schools ) .
[native] albanian players viewed the player as trying to ruin their flag so they charged and pushed him .
[native] another example is finding what countries have what official positions in eu negotiations .
[native] but i think that international celebrations like halloween are good for the world , it helps to establish a sense of global unity .
[non-native] the first concernes the big distance that every person has to acheve to go to his or her work that is the conciconce of big cities and also there are some people how live in a city and travel to anthor city to work .
[native] i remember for a period of a few months , editorial sections of newspapers were full of defenses of china 's pollution - we are a huge developing country , not a developed country who can afford to burn less coal , etc etc.
[non-native] for example , i have studied child education for several years and i teach in elementary school right now .
[native] israel started the war ( s ) , that is the difference .
[non-native] however if the government had changed the education system , government assert that we need this spectular kind of workers and schools would tried to make for this kind of workers to focus on one specific subject .
[non-native] the current generations , particularly students are engrossed in their studies and sports rather than making an effort to help others .
[non-native] this is because specific doctors have studied the influence of colours in human mental thoughts .
[non-native] for tavel alone or with goup , i think the best way for taveling now is with group for two reasons : one of this is to get a chance to know a lot of gorouse place in the coustry that you want to tavel and other is to save your money .
[non-native] let 's see another example , which might sounds more familiar and could explain why i do n't fully agree with the statement .
[native] i remember one restaurant in particular on ÑÐ»Ð¸ÑÐ° ÑÐ²Ð¾ÑÐ½Ð¸ÑÐºÐ¾Ð³Ð¾ which always had bentleys and fast audis parked outside .
[native] even if all they 're doing is opening it and handing it to you ?
[native] i just wanted to make sure i worded that correctly , which i probably did n't .
[non-native] finally , young players nowadays are definetly working hard not only for themselves but also for the community inturn to the country .
[native] why does the article say `` valio '' all over , but the picture shows cheese marked as `` viola '' ?
[native] his cabinet 's tend to be tories that are n't rivals to him .
[non-native] if you only invest in blue chips , your chance to obtain a great benefit is much lower as if you put your money in more risky assets .
[non-native] everyone wants friends to speak of , and anyone loves human beings .
[non-native] to be more specific , half of my friends are both working and studying .
[non-native] they examine the total process and they find the mistakes in that .
[non-native] with this knowledge you might be an interesting candidate for `` who wants to be a millionaire ? '' , but not for a good job in industry .
[non-native] in order to maintain the hope of being able to compete against lots of applicants for all sorts of institutions , one must maintain excellent grades .
[native] there 's plenty of fucked up grammar bits in english , even if it does n't have the ridiculous kind of conjugations that some other languages can have .
[native] european trade is my personal field of study and literal interest , like my interest in horror films or french wine .
[non-native] it make you feel taht you are buying a part of a dream . ..
[native] we would then betray them at any opportunity because they are the welsh .
[non-native] thus , i agree that successful people have experience of trying new things and taking risks .
[native] nothing about the eu , iraq , mexican immigrants changes any of that .
[native] welsh is quite nice , and that 's a er ... interesting theory .
[native] paying for water is n't unusual - a lot of countries do it that way .
[non-native] so they do not feel the need to fix something because everything around them is fixed .
[native] look up the 30 years war and the protestant reformation if you want more information .
[native] hell we can even buy guns and ammo online with a credit card and have them shipped to our front doors .
[native] that was a gesture of friendship that the dutch have continued to thank us for ever since .
[native] i 've got family in the uk who 're friends with quite a few scots , and their friends are all against it .
[native] i would say the founding fathers of the modern ideals of europe would be people like kant , rousseau , metternich , and bismarck .
[non-native] as it is discussed above , i 'd like to understand ideas than to concepts since it provides lots of benefits to studeni agree to the statement proposed .
[non-native] no one could argue that finding and getting together with the people you understand each other is
[native] it 's sad to see some people did n't get your reference and downvoted you , but it 's even sadder that a nearly three hundred year old satire is still relevant .
[native] `` once again we end up on the wrong side of the cock '' ?
[non-native] then she have to go over it all again and forget about the one that she was learning before .
[native] even in melbourne and sydney , it seems every month there 's a story of a racist rant on a train .
[native] > if you want prosperity in all european nations , wealthier nation states must pay poorer ones .
[native] > the uk also needs to keep a permanent hold on at least part of the island for security and strategic purposes .
[non-native] young people has more good accesses to meet many people .
[non-native] for these three reason i thing most adsi agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
[non-native] for example , in a drink advertisement , a man is getting really thirsty after sport and he is drinking his drink .
[native] when india played pakistan in the cricket world cup , both countries put their armies on the highest alert level .
[non-native] therefore , think more in how to progress and inprove their day to day life than in regreating about what they did in the past .
[non-native] taking the same example like above , a rich boy goes playing football in the social club , where his parents have some share .
[non-native] alot of childrens are fun they make their perents and grand perents have a nice time with them so old people enjoy their time with their grandchildrens .
[native] i feel as though this entire referendum is a false dichotomy .
[native] i 'm all mixed up ... munich had a bid for 2018 but failed , with the ioc voting for pyeongchang .
[native] is the dividing line between the type of people who want in/out with the eu .
[non-native] it may help students spend at least time to volunteer but they will become avoid helping others because of this rule , which is essential to go to good school or get a better job in our country .
[non-native] in order to learn new things , people must get educated .
[native] * large diaspora ( i 'm an irish citizen :d ) .
[native] or americans with european citizenship such as myself who realize that the joke is incorrect , but still say it to annoy french people .
[native] whilst it 's a great idea , i do n't see it happening .
[native] * worst case scenario : * huge chunks of the entire world become radioactive wasteland as we escalate to icbms & wide-spread thermonuclear warfare .
[native] almost the entirety of aegean islands belong to greece via internationally recognized treaties .
[native] if i were a lawyer and thought a different thing , it would be relevant to mention that i was a lawyer .
[native] that has to be the most disgusting thing ever .
[native] now , shall we talk about you leaving the eu , recreating the commonwealth , and subsequently buying 25,726 tonnes of delicious lamb ?
[native] '' * > * `` ttip will be a disaster for working men and women on both sides of the atlantic .
[non-native] so this is cumpulsory for all of us to attain a minimum amount of knowledge about all the things so that our life moves on smoothly .
[non-native] thus it is sensible for you tohave various choosing plan in your futuer .
[native] > that 's far less easy to do than to say , armchair economist .
[non-native] and the movie ` on golden poud ' did show the enjoyment of the elders with their own children .
[native] in the kremlin , or where ? ' and he said : ` no , i 've decided to do this informally . ' the meeting was at stalin 's dacha .
[native] as i recall , it 's run by mehr demokratie , an organization with the laudable goal of stronger democracy , but in execution has little pragmatic value .
[native] where as india 's growth is largely due to the services and ict industry .
[non-native] to take a great view of the horizon from the peak of a mountain or simply from the ground .
[non-native] the very first reason supporting my point of view would be that i can barely imagine another goal for advertising than highlighting the qualities of the presented products .
[non-native] but do young people enjoy life more than older people do ?
[non-native] i think like this because when you are graduate there is n't anything more between you and you work life , and work in general is more about facts thant theory .
[native] even under the ` what 's good for the tax payer is good for society ' mantra , having fewer criminals due to proper rehabilitation is certainly better than simply filling up prisons ( which are by no means cheap to run ) with repeat offending prisoners .
[native] an eu candidate , but there does n't seem to be any progress from either side for that .
[non-native] also helping communities may involve money which many cant afford .
[non-native] the young , therefore , are not willing to help their neighbors .
[non-native] in my opinion , both of them have merits .
[native] otoh , chocolate is much , much stereotypically an `` evil corrupt scheming oligarch '' industry compared to oil .
[native] we all seem to have holidays around christmas and easter even before christianity for example .
[non-native] students can either just memorize the formulas or try to understand why the ball is moving the way it is .
[non-native] if there are so many advertisments , it 's will mean that they need other people , especially young people .
[native] yes , property is , in some cases , the assertion of an absolute right where no such right exists morally ; hence proudhon 's claim that it is theft .
[non-native] when i buy the car , i always look the advertisement which are listed a lot of them .
[non-native] the problem here is , the cars are polluting the air , and too many cars are leading us to traffics .
[native] that said , / u/slyratchet is a mod of / r/europe and one of the few posters that seems to care about the state of the subreddit , i recall his admonishments of people 's circlejerk tendencies from over a year ago , so there 's no need to view him as biased .
[native] i think you 'll find two things : young educated ( uni ) people , people who run business ( ceos ect ) and people even remotely educated want to remain in the eu .
[non-native] in my opinion , the best way to travel is unquestionably on one 's own .
[native] too bad the former yugoslavia is n't on this map ; we could see how many people can speak each of serbian , croatian , bosnian , and montenegrin .
[native] in the nato-as-boogyman narrative , the kaliningrad oblast ( for example ) is under potential threat .
[native] i mean putin 's pragmatic , he does n't ideologically oppose media freedoms , and as long as he 's as popular as he is . .
[native] i know the general history behind it , but not current politics .
[non-native] risks and new things lead to better production and better outcomes .
[native] yet again , i might be just confusing myself with all the terminology .
[native] britain was still held in high esteem here , even after the failure of gallipolli in ww1 .
[native] yet the simple fact that we have such a diverse population means that issues will inevitable arise .
[native] i imagine you would have to have screwed up pretty bad with your paperwork or answers to get it rejected .
[non-native] the american enterprise is not outsouring , to generate a higher gdp and safety for the american people .
[non-native] however , it is hard to say that one way is better than the other one , because it mostly depends of the situation .
[non-native] if we intend to succeed in a particular field then we need to plan in such a way that we are also aware of the recent developments in that particular field i.e ... , we have to be upto date regarding that particular subject or field .
[native] soviet union placed ukranians there too where they didnt belong so let 's not get it twisted
[native] it 's the most well known date associated with irish independence .
[native] this is the kind of wide-eyed naivete that helped absolutely ruin russia in the 90s and led to putin - not that i 'm saying catalonia would be in that path , but there really have to be some serious discussions more than just `` ens roba espanya '' and `` serem lliures '' .
[non-native] but you can not judge the entire young generation only by looking at them .
[native] as a result we have copied and pasted most of our industry standards such as engineering , telecommunications or manufacturing from the americans though nafta .
[non-native] so i prefer in ideas and concepts in which most of the facts are emerged .
[non-native] if you want to make yourself specilized on the subject of biology .
[native] israel is racking up a thousand to one civilian body count , supposedly in the name of defence and preserving civilian life , while hamas is a hateful terrorist group that uses its own people as human shields .
[non-native] many many of us follow that same concepts to explain the student then ask him to learn on there own .
[native] > the crux of the issue is between two views on laws and justice i think you ca n't see the forest for the trees .
[non-native] therefore , they use techniques that glorify their products so customers are persuated to buy them .
[non-native] like housband hite the wife and kids , old people died in ther own house for several days and young people stolen from the ladies pack .
[non-native] so in this kind of a position the customer have to be smart , to see if people makes the products seem much better than they really are .
[non-native] as above the reasons i showed , i can not agree the number of cars will decrease in twenty years .if i had the chance to visit the parts of the world that i have always wanted to , such as france or italy , i would definitely choose to be accompanied by only a couple of the people who share the same interests with me rather than a large group and i would not want to be accompained by a tour guide .
[native] you are always bound to get a fair share of outside psychopaths joining the war .
[native] give you more powers so you can unilaterally declare independence ?
[native] > except it wont , because canada is a progressive liberal nation and the uk is a regressive isolationist xenophobic nationalistic shit hole .
[native] nah relax , too many muslims live comfortable ` western ' lives , they wo n't give that up easily .
[non-native] to be able to leave others behind , you need to excel in what you do .
[native] > `` i 'm happy that the commission be fairly criticised , but i do n't accept unfair or unjust criticism , '' he told journalists in brussels .
[native] then the rest is how they fare in between .
[non-native] this will make cars more affordable in the future .
[non-native] finally , though people ought to be brilliant at some specific subjects in one 's life , which is also of great importance to succeed in life , to be a person has the capacity of knowing lots of things also helps people a lot .
[non-native] second reason is that products in tv advertisements seem more useful than they really are .
[native] edit : oh , i 'm sorry , were we all pretending that this is n't just a situation fabricated by the spanish and escalated by the british ?
[non-native] in the one hand , some people believe that cars will be reduced in near future .
[native] the british loyalists went to canada after the loss of the 13 colonies .
[native] i am not trying to be cruel , but no country on earth takes in every person , and canada is big geographically but not population wise so we need to be smart about who comes here since to many non-contributors would overburden an already burdened system .
[native] i agree that the uk is unlikely to ever develop constitution worship comparable to what can be seen in the states .
[native] i dont think that bombing the crap out of innocent men , women , and children is doing israel any favours .
[native] maybe you could get away with it the first time , but the second time there 'll be missiles flying if they do n't turn around .
[non-native] i think everyone will think the life in old age is fun and enjoy it when thay become old and forget that they were thinking this statement .the statement about advertisements is , in my opinion , complitey correct .
[non-native] if we consider the above factor as the most important thing , we may say that young people enjoy life more .
[non-native] i want to know and understand what my teacher is telling me .
[non-native] also we would have a chance to find the subject which we really like by chancing our subject .
[non-native] if we have knowledge on one particular subject it would very easy for us even to find jobs related to that subject .
[native] i was thinking that too , but i think that 's mostly because of how much of an insufferable arse i find letterman to be .
[native] i have spoken to a lot of people about this issue , many left spanish republicans are against secession ( socialists often hate partition ) and many are also for it .
[non-native] one are not going to be able to do everything one wants .
[native] second , it 's not ` straw man bullshit ' , it 's a think tank principally funded by labour unions that are naturally opposed by ftas .
[native] there is also a lot to support this theory .

[native] they only typicall sued when farmers were actively trying to promote the growth of gm crops pollinating their fields , such as by spraying round up ( a herbicide ) on their crops , thereby not having to pay for the patented seeds .
[native] it should be ` root cause ' , but since northern africa is a route for those fleeing war it might be a ` route cause ' .
[native] some countries have double-taxation agreements , which credit the tax paid in your country of residence .
[non-native] firstly , since many new cars are been coming into the present market .
[non-native] first , throught understanding ideas , students may become more logical than before .
[non-native] thank you .in my opinion succesful people have always succeded when they have taken the risk .
[native] it would not be good for the lungs if it got into a ship .
[non-native] i sometimes feel some of advertisments are n't genuin materials which are couting something else , different color , or kind of immitations .
[native] so you feel by giving the regions statehood - i.e.
[non-native] as the matter of fact , people who are specialists into two or three activities always succed in it so can be considered as successful people .
[non-native] in some segment of society , young people now are more distracted by the modernization of the society .
[non-native] i think that this type of people who succed in whaever they do is extremly rare .
[native] not just , there are a large number of multinationals here as well .
[non-native] i was very embaressesed from my friend who had to throw her shirt after that day .
[non-native] some of them may running businesses well , some of them may doing well in there polictical career .
[native] this extent of corruption requires massive economies of scale and it would be seriously undermined if the uk left .
[non-native] they either go to the community library to do clean-ups and shelving , or they go to the `` old folks home '' to interact with the old people there and ensure these people have fun and joy .
[native] have a few coal plants for cheap power , so that consumers are n't struck by high electricity prices , as much renewables as you can safely and economically tack on , and then some nuclear on the side to provide emissions free power .
[non-native] that way , students will be able to participate more in community service and receive a wonderful experience by spending time helping others and building a better community .traveling is a good way to have good time .
[native] we 've seen articles suggesting london is france 's [ sixth biggest city ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26823489 ) , yet nobody complains of all the french people stealing our jobs .
[native] i 'm trying to make you challenge your beliefs , because they do n't ` have a rational basis .
[non-native] but i will spend more time to helping communities .
[native] like i said , i 'm not trying to convince you of anything .
[non-native] at that time what i did was just to follow the old rule .
[native] not that the ecb 's idea of using outright monitary transactions to purcahse bonds of crisis countries , or the bank of england 's quantative easing is very far off ...
[native] the [ courts ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/canada_court_system.svg ) are independent , but the justices of the supreme court of canada , the federal courts , the appellate courts and the superior-level courts are appointed by the governor-in-council ( by the governor general on the advice of the federal cabinet , meaning the pm ) .
[native] apparently some guy was arrested a few weeks ago because he said `` fuck off '' to the queen on twitter .
[non-native] as far as i 'm concerned , we should use time specializing in one specific subject .
[non-native] everyone has different point of views about the idea of concepts , ideas and facts .
[non-native] people who made the advertisement conviced you that this candle is the best one .
[non-native] by doing that , i will save the pain of ordering wrong things on the menu , and more importantly , i wo n't keep loosing my way because of sign boards written in a foreign language .
[native] the missile launcher variants were meant to give strategic bombers an way around anti-air weapons , this idea was abandoned in favor of stealth technology because interceptor range and speed increased .
[native] lobbying is amoral , it does n't have to be beneficial to the greater public .
[native] you 'll have a pack of neo-nazis armed to the teeth after the war who might feel betrayed by when their government turns their back on them .
[native] if they do n't wish to have real diplomatic relations then it is not particularly in ireland 's interest to take pains to maintain them when they seem intent only on generating stories for ynetnews .
[non-native] these people do not care about the environement , and for them it doesn t matter if they pollute .
[non-native] at that time , i regretted that i did n't have the knowledge .
[native] replacing the hot food at regular intervals seems reasonable as well .
[native] breasts are usually the best part of fat women .
[native] we live in liberal-democracies , which protect the minority from the majority , and where laws ought to have a valid justification for them beyond ` everyone wants it ' .
[non-native] for instance , i once read an e-mail that talked about the fact that americans were the first people who went to the moon which becomes questionable when a proffessional photographer provide a paper that analyis the pictures that were taken on the moon by the american and political issues were involved .
[native] if what you say is true , then we must forgive russia for its invasion of crimea .
[non-native] from my point of view it is important to specialize in one specific subject for many reasons as described in the following .
[non-native] it 's the question if you really get what they are pretending .
[native] and people deny putin has a cult of personality around him .
[native] theives might steal the thing and * sell * it to the black market , from where certain intel organizations may buy it .
[native] what i usually see for tuition fees from a lot of universities in other countries ( germany , nederland , belgium , france , sweden etc ) is around 5000-8000 .
[non-native] in the end beckham 's name and logo on the container will not make the scent as glorious as the goal scored in the t.v commercial stated earlier .i do agree most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
[native] here let me give you a small little hint , lets see if you can follow along .
[non-native] but knowing of the different subjects come may confused by the concepts they did not know the concept is specified in that subject .
[native] it think there were also some citizenship issues there .
[non-native] i was surprised because i never challenged to compete as breast stroke swimmer and that competition assembled very expert and elite swimmers .
[native] the idea that people still convert back to there old currencies is mind boggling to me .
[non-native] whether you believe it or not , different kind of subject give us more information than the same subject .
[native] our economy has suffered and we are not equipped to deal with the costs that would come with unification .
[native] do n't forget there are a lot of francophones outside of quÃ©bec in canada .
[native] that 's what a lot of us have been trying to tell them .
[non-native] third , you should undersand the academic thing as a whole .
[non-native] finally , it is not so difficult to come across university even high school students working on part-time jobs .
[non-native] for example bill gates is a very successful person but he is successful only because years ago he took a big risk : in fact he created a computer company and he spent a lot of money in this work .
[non-native] first , the nature of advertisement is not to show people how bad the products are , but to convince them that these products are so beneficial to people 's lives that they should buy .
[non-native] this experience may extend their knowledge and give a new concept of futher study .
[non-native] for instance , my schedule of study will not be shared into many different academic subjects .
[native] who gives a fuck what the age of consent is in france or spain .
[non-native] if you are willing to help the community , you can always find time to do that .i think there is not a moment in your life more pleasant than other , the whole life is a cicles of growing personally and intelectually , and one should enjoy every step in this cicle , so i disagree with the statement .
[non-native] my answer , so my solution to the question , could not be so clear after what i 'm going to state right now , but , reading what i have just wrote above this final lines , you will be able to understand my vision :
[non-native] personally , when i graduated two years ago i chose where i would like to work , in which sector and what will be my goals .
[native] i 'm not going to comment on your hypothetical egg scenario because we simply do n't know what 's going to be subject to isds provisions and what is n't .
[native] agreed , the obvious crazy homeless guy going on about demons and lizard people is n't the one you need to worry about .
[non-native] every people might have a favorite color , so they can be attracted by products .
[native] even civil right 's leaders had it in their speeches .
[native] that 's exactly what my preference for world governance is .
[non-native] so , i would finally would say that the number of car usage would not decrease in the future but , the way in which usage would be changed , which would be very freindly scenario .people started to learn in school but after sometime books are not enough .
[non-native] the two possibilities rappresent two kind of ideas , and the use of the first one , in opposite of using of the second one is different case by case .
[non-native] a young person can go running , play football , drive a race care and play a young people new electronic games .
[native] this shit might 've been a benefit in the last century when the world revolved around europe & the soviet union was our greatest rival , but it 's not the cold war anymore .
[native] so by your own assessment , you should n't have made that first statement i quoted .
[native] if the weather and cuisine was better , you would be number one imo .
[non-native] so , he needs to specialize in one specific subject , where he is dreaming to work .
[native] there 's also the whole `` holocaust '' thing , though i doubt you believe in that anyway ...
[native] if what these people did is not already a punishable act , perhaps it should be .
[native] they are n't really , that is why i answered `` no . ''
[native] defence policy , energy policy , and foreign policy , for example .
[non-native] learning means u gain some experience that helps to provide new skill for you .
[non-native] even cars make make our life more easy , its disadventages is out weigh than its adventages .
[native] however , the point is that islamic societies as a scientific and cultural force never recovered after that .
[native] otoh it seems to be in british nature to understate things all the time .
[non-native] when i was tenth , i took many academy for learnig something after school .
[non-native] in my opinion , a strong society is the one in which politics can exceed the walls of the parliement .
[non-native] as for the younger people , they still have a lot of strength and energy left to move around and use as much power as they want .
[native] you 're trying to sound tough but it is n't working .
[native] interestingly , irish people i know in london are now thinking about moving back .
[native] `` if its in our interest to take it , and its worth the risk to give it a go lets give it a go ''
[non-native] by the way , instead of trying new things or taking risks , one can profit from its own knowledges or try to be satisfied in his borders .
[non-native] i think also that school that has an important influence on the background of students_life , must try to prepare belanced people who can look at theirs futur without fear .
[non-native] with all the aspects considered above , young people enjoy life more than older people do .
[native] well i know there is a political group that is far right called svoboda , however they are a minority in ukraine .
[non-native] due to spending more on the advertisement , the producers are not able to invest money to increase the quality of the product , decrease the price of the product and icrease the quantity of the product .
[non-native] on one hand , when children are at school , they learn many subjects such as history , geography , mathematics , languages .
[non-native] older people enjoy life in a diferent way simply because they no longer have the time , or energy , to do the things they used to do .
[native] i hope that the eu will not forget that .
[non-native] in order to understand ideas and concepts it is necessary to have a basic knowledge of facts .
[native] so , we need to only build nuclear power plants that do not have this problem , from now on , and we need to figure out ways to address this problem with the ones we do .
[non-native] this is not only done by the ad 's on tv .
[non-native] nowadays there are two conflicting ideas about how to teach the students , to let them learn facts or to focus on the understanding of each concept .
[non-native] learing many academic subject needs a lot of time .
[non-native] you can do the studies you like , eat your prefered food instead of always thinking about to the vegetables your mother cocked .
[native] i do n't give a shit about monsanto , you 're free to criticize it .
[native] i do n't quite ... agree with it personally ... in the context of * countries * with national or state divisions , but * i understand it * .
[non-native] moreover , if some academic in many academic subjects is not interesting to people , then the environment discouages people 's studying ability for example , according to the study by one of the most famous professor dr. kim in republic of korea , 68.9 % of people like learing one exciting academic subject because it makes people 's good studying circumstances .
[native] i wonder if you even realize how stupid the shit you type is .
[native] yeah , im sure that 's first on putin 's to-do list ; start a war with usa over some fucking shack that is n't worth anything .
[native] `` anatolians '' is not a useful label by the way - anatolia has had native greeks for a very , very long time .
[non-native] other hand , if you study economics or marketing you have a much
[non-native] if the student dont get the main idea and concept about any topic then they has to suffer a lot while reading the subject .
[non-native] as a result you get the job and you can earn a high salary and live a pretty good life .
[native] that said , moving your business to a country with rampant corruption comes with its own risks , so i guess it 's easier for the company to stay put and the employee take on the extra risk by immigrating and accepting crappy wages and condititions instead .
[non-native] and after a long walk or traveling , they may recover quickly and go on with another adventure .
[native] plenty of young people in ireland drink a lot .
[native] the us freaks out when we [ accidentally bring them into the us ] ( http://www.canada.com/life/kinder+surprises+banned/2353187/story.html ) .
[native] this crisis is a potential threat to the balkan states .
[non-native] first of all , young people studying hard in university and treying to improve them selves by getting high marks and entering the best companies and get the best position in them works to improve them countries .
[native] america would beat them decisively in a conventional war .
[non-native] during life or school we continously learn and experience things .
[non-native] for example , a company sold 100000 units of a product with some fake advertisement , but by the time their next product the public get clever and even if it is a great product they will not buy it and that is way more important than 100000 sales of the previous item .
[native] there could be one single house of parliament , but each piece of legislation can be petitioned against with an online platform ran by the government , where each citizen is given an account .
[non-native] by this you do not have to go to every places and look for the intersting one .
[non-native] on the ther hand , now there are many companies that they sale their stuffs in the tv show .
[non-native] the danger i could lose my money trough investing in food would extremly be increased , compared with the rate of losing my money with remaining selling shoes .
[non-native] by getting more and more information on the subject she/he will be more self-confident person .
[non-native] on the other hand , i agree with the statement that young people today do not give enough time to help their communities .
[non-native] first of all , what is the definition of learning ?
[native] we are not a state of the uk , i agree , but i think that culturally we are much more similar than the us and should be focusing our efforts on more of a global arrangement while maintaining our independence .
[native] i think a majority of ukip voters would at least be aware of ukip 's policy of brexit , even if it were n't their main reason for voting them .
[native] i thought that was because farmers get tans so a tan makes you look poor
[non-native] for example , for getting some at market the people get their car also to do few meters , because , so they do less work .
[non-native] many people think that the concept or meaning is the only thing that matters , because they are superficial and do n't look behind to see the facts .
[non-native] his extremely descriptive and flowing writing style was first not very well-regarded ; however , he is not considered as one of the best writers in latin america , and numerous writers actually imitate his writing style that a new style of writing called `` magical realism '' finally was created .
[non-native] gaining more profits and competing other companies are reasons which allowed many companies to exploit people need for better and cheaper products .
[non-native] in short , i prefer to trip without a tour guide because i do n't want toi always belive that every age has its own beauty .
[native] i think it 's way too early to tell .
[native] i agree , i think if we are going to go towards a more united europe , one step ( granted a big one ) is the issuing of euro bonds .
[non-native] thus all these reasons suggest that their will never be a reduction in the demands of car and hence we will see more and more cars on the roads few years from now .i 'm agree for the statement above .
[native] oh and i now expect that you 'll be belittling the opinion of every other european who has n't lived in catalunya for an extended period of time , too - seeing as your `` what the fuck would you know '' stance is so thought-through and consistent .
[non-native] a football team needs players that are specialized in throwing , catching , running , blocking etc . .
[non-native] however , as for me , it is no doubt that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in the next twenty years .
[native] > merkel , just build up your army and maintain it properly then everyone will think germany is being aggressive .
[non-native] the most important aspect is not to try just for try , or not to take a risk just for take it , you have to establish an object and work hardly for it .
[non-native] you do n't have to be successful in order to learn new things .
[non-native] my opinion is based on my past vacation experience and my personal preferences in regard to organize my vacation time .
[non-native] both have there own standing .some people feel that it is more important to learn facts than to understand ideas and concepts .
[native] i got banned from there for asking for too much proof lol
[non-native] since school asks a lot of work and that more and more young people have sport after college , it is difficult for them to find a place in their schedule to help their community .
[native] and the fear of trade policy recriminations , which would damage the eu massively given that uk runs a massive trade deficit with eu .
[native] :) it strikes me that the valencian community is a particularly corrupt region - is there any truth to that or is it just a spate of recent high profile reporting ?
[non-native] to sum it up , i sustain that in twenty years there will be fewer cars .the question being asked is if traveling in a group with a tour guide is a best type of tour .
[non-native] the knowledges of many academic subjects permit of use everykind of knowledge in all type of academic subjects .
[native] i have met some french people of maghreb ( ian ) descent in my country and they seemed very friendly .
[non-native] for example , i liked biology in my high school .
[non-native] in conclusion , as i said before , both the decoration of the most advertisements and the technology as well as some taste changes of products are absolutely related with the advertisements which make products seem much better than they really are .
[native] some wanted to , not all germans in the army wanted to kill all te slavs .
[non-native] to sum up , although it is unethical for a company to give a different image of its product , they unfortunatetly imply this method .
[native] nukes will fall before russian and american soldiers come face to face .
[native] parr is actually the one i see most commonly .
[native] ah , i was only there once for a weekend .
[native] often times they support the same things for different reasons .
[non-native] now thay may learn about things that they never though about which-in my opinion-will add to thier knowledge alot .
[native] northern ireland : so complicated * neither * country really wants it any more .
[native] maybe we can get involved if the shit really hits the fan but you guys should really be taking the lead here .
[non-native] in order for a product to seem better , advertisement companies would do everything to attract people .
[non-native] other reason is bacause all the people do not act in the same way .
[non-native] this should start right from his secondary schooling days .
[native] which was a deliberate provocation by putin who is probably the poker stars strategist of our time .
[native] this is the same borris whose suggestion for the euro crisis was to ` let greece go ' .
[non-native] this essay focus on that most advertisemens make products seem much better than they really are .
[non-native] that is why i disagree with this opinion .now-a-days the life for everyone has become hectic , let it be a boy going to the college or middle aged man who has family responsibilites .
[native] that will basically play the middle class in the developed world off against the skilled workers in the developing world in ways we have never seen before .
[non-native] the government encourages people who use the public transportation by taking their taxes less .
[native] and i 'm a power bottom ( Í¡ Â° ÍÊ Í¡ Â° )
[non-native] for example , my brother who is working as a software engineer is busy with his job working late nights on tasks assigned to him .
[non-native] first , this increased individualism and time shortage applies to all the age groups in an equal manner , and second , nowadays communities have much less needs which must be satisfied by the commitment of young people .
[native] i am not really sure ; the judiciary is known in japan for being harsh and extremely uncorrupt though ( though police is considered somewhat incompetent ) .
[native] it 's not only crisis countries that are struggling , many stronger countries also have debt well above 60 % of their gdp .
[native] that embarrassment would then grow if the uk prospered and the eu languished ( as is happening now ) , but whether that would actually still happen post-2017 and post-brexit is another question entirely .
[native] and to suggest that all people that are anti-partition are right wing or racist would be frankly pretty offensive to a lot of them .
[native] they 're suing them under the energy charter treaty , a treaty which has been ratified by the german government , for something .
[non-native] these subjects make a person spend a lot of time on them because ther are many of them and he must gives them the same attention .
[native] also , tons of people copycatted surnames of famous nobility in history .
[non-native] second , traveling in a group led by a tour guide is more fun than travel alone or without tour guide .
[native] i do n't see what that has to do with you misrepresenting the report .
[non-native] there might be some youngsters who are involved in drug activities or crimes or some even `` doing nothing sitting at home '' types .
[non-native] maybe this person will have lots of experience in several activities but he is not good in all this activities or he does not succed in all the activities he tries .
[non-native] i wasted my time and money on eating fast food in japan .
[non-native] then in the school , we need to allocate more time to teach the importance of helping communities , not just ask the student to focus on their study .
[non-native] i believe this because , the life will end for them in a very short time later , they have many things to do and many people to care , and they do n't have a lot of expectations from the life .no i do n't agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because for my opinion i think both of them are imporatnt for students to know .
[native] they do not do excursions in south america to destabilize governments and other shit like that .
[native] for the record i think it is common sense that the eu has higher product safety standards , food standards , etc.
[native] i can certainly see the parallel with italy with respect to beppe grillo , but i ca n't say i can see it with spain .
[native] the interesting thing is how many italians have moved to the uk over the last three or so years .
[non-native] one of them is that although there are several research and development activities revolving on the issue of fuel consumption , the primary fuel for now is oil which is a really scarce resource in te world and which each day needs more expenses and effort to be harvested .
[native] you have the opportunity to bury the hatchet and try and move on , but you respond with pettiness .
[non-native] the man how have amillions of dollars , he should do any thing to keep his money by using advertisement .
[non-native] fact also tells students to believe in the world they are living in .
[non-native] this idea comes from a well known process which leads the formation of several other prejudices ( like , for example , the idea that home made products are always better than industrial ones ) .
[native] if they ca n't be bothered to do basic research before they leave their country to go fight in a foreign civil war , i do n't think they deserve a break .
[non-native] as long as there are rural countries , cars will not be decreased .
[native] how big a percentage of those foreigners are danes or norwegians ?
[native] i 'm just explaining the rationale dude , i 'm not defending the system .
[non-native] as you clearly understand that broad knowledge of many academic subject so important that it remains to be seen .
[native] ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=iyjkd0rkkss#t=97 ) watching him work wood is incredibly satisfying .
[non-native] for example take the case of wright brother of america who has led to the discovery of jet plane , aeroplane .
[non-native] new things would never discovered or come in to existence if the person like edison , ghram bell and nicolas tesla would have risks there all possesion for there new inventions .
[native] i do n't see how ddg is more private except for the fact that google/nsa wo n't get a few lines on their log saying * somebody * searched for cute kittens .
[non-native] he is a decorator and he lost all his money and everything he made up several years ago .
[native] far better to leave the uk because you 're motivated to arrive in germany because you love germany for example .
[non-native] to restrict his attention to facts prevent him from developing his autonomy .although many people think older people can not enjoy life as much as younger , i think they can .
[native] if these were some as you put it `` neckheads in extended puberty '' waving an anonymous flag or an anarchist flag `` trying to mean something '' i 'd tend to agree with you but given the flag they are waving and what it truly stands for i ca n't help but disagree with your assessment .
[non-native] this can be harmful for the product 's sales in two ways : the consumer will not buy it again , and he/she will feel cheated , misguided and angry .
[native] on one side of the pond the government is being criticised for invading the privacy of their citizens , and on the other it 's being criticised for protecting them .
[non-native] moreover financial problems are more for old people when compared to young people because old people will not have sufficient energy to work so they cant earn money to spend it on different amusements for enjoying thier life .
[non-native] unluckly , students who don ` t study about broad subject might have possibility to see one aspect to others .
[native] i 'm really sad this video had no translation .
[native] if the world suddenly stopped recognizing hawaii as a u.s. state , it would n't change anything with regard to hawaiians ' status in america .
[native] most people who cry `` shills '' never seem to offer proof of said shilling .
[non-native] first of all , the statistics done up to now show us that there has been a rapid increase in the amount of cars in use all around the world .
[native] you are clearly viewing things from only one side .
[native] ** against ( * in the case of intervening to oust russia from all of ukraine * ) ** .
[non-native] i think it relies on the marketing strategies and also moral of sellers how much better advertisements are allowed to make products seem .
[non-native] for example , they can travel the world and see everything about the life by spending this energy .
[non-native] success deals with your personal values much more than what you actually do .
[non-native] on the other hand , if a 5-year old boy were to jump around naked in his yard , he obviously would n't get caught .
[native] it 's a sociopathic view of the world which , far from creating a stable international order , produced some of the most appalling conflicts in human history .
[native] russia has a huge number of newspapers ( something like the highest in the world according to wikipedia ) , and it suits the executive to leave opposition or independent newspapers as an outlet .
[non-native] godot-a godot could be anythng , it could be salvation , inner happiness , prostitute , family happiness or anything
[non-native] in my eyes this question brings up a very important issue in times of increasing interdisciplinary work .
[non-native] for instance , in fact i exprienced to feel danger for the cars .
[non-native] thirdly , young people have more opportunities and less obligations and are more inclined to venture into unexplored areas and innovate .
[non-native] however , there are disadvantages for cars such as , pollution .
[native] my boyfriend was forced into joining the army when he told his parents , and his father beat him because of it .
[non-native] it means that many of professors believe that studying and understand ideas and concepts rather than study only fact is more effective to learn .
[native] > does the average pole have any idea how incredibly offensive accusations of betrayal are given that we entered the war because of poland ?
[non-native] in other words , they should teach you how to use your capabilities .
[non-native] the primary reasons for this belief are the balance a student gains from having broad knowledge and the interrelationships that exist between different subjects .
[non-native] another solid example of youth 's contribution to the society is their desire in expressing their political opinions and taking the necessary action .
[non-native] what do they do with the huge sum of money they have just got after retiring from office ?
[non-native] if she figure out this subject , she could pass the exam .
[native] germany is far from mercantlist , being one of the largest proponents of free trade within the eu .
[non-native] after careful observation and sufficent evidence i strongly agree that many products are of less standard than the thwey are advertised .most people are considering which is better for them between having broad knowledge of many academic subjects and having knowledge in one specific subject .
[non-native] moreover , the more people we travel with , the less we have to pay individually .
[native] lol which heart attack , did n't that evil bastard have like ten ?
[native] yet for some reasons , that fear is seen as credible , whilst people complaining about power lines are seen as a joke .
[non-native] furthermore , i don4t see the resaon why it should be placed as priority because when you see the amount of drinkable water decreasing in coutries like bangladesh for instance , i really think there is still to be done before prohibiting carsin this modern era of drastic changes of sceince and technology , young people play a predominant role .
[non-native] after than for instance , a specific issue is selected in the master 's degree .
[non-native] they have been excluded from the car market for a very long time because they were no potential buyers .
[native] you have n't been in / r/europe long i take it ?
[native] i do n't think yeltsin was scum , he just tried too much too fast and was kind of a better populist than a real politician , what russia needed at the time was a technocrat who knew real economics and instead they got a naive and somewhat egotistical man who thought transition would be easier than it was .
[non-native] when i walk around , i even can smell the bad gas on the air , and the part , it is getting worse .

[non-native] in conculsion , if you want to travel in freely whatever you would like to do and visit without concerning the tour schecule or time , in my opinion , the best way to travel in group led by a tour guide is not good .

[non-native] second , i think young people have many oppotunities to find new one such a new friends or new world .
[native] i guess when you imagine european immigrants in britain you imagine eastern europeans rather than italians .

[native] i suspect that mr juncker also often said one thing in a meeting and entirely another outside it during his 13 years as luxembourg 's prime minister and 20 years as its finance minister .
[native] they did n't know the exact figure but they knew something like this was coming up .
[non-native] from my point of view , i strongly side with the later groups who believes learn facts are more inportant .
[native] it 's hard to justify spending money on huge carriers given the mess the british economy was in when it came to replace the carriers we were still using from wwii , and well we were never likely to be operating alone and nato carriers could fill in gaps in our capability if needed .
[native] that their own cultural feelings and preferences are n't a universal law .
[non-native] second , i do n't want to pay waste mony using a tour guide .

[native] how would you feel if you were a german or finn and found that your taxes were disappearing to nowhere ?
[native] as a warnings , i 'd avoid arguing any more with the guy .
[non-native] finally i would like to say that even i think that young people enjoy life more than older people do , that doesnt mean that older people does not enjoy life , i think that older people could enjoy life by other ways than young people do that could be apropriate for them and for there age , in my opinion every person could enjoy life if he or she want to but in different ways .i agree with this statement for the following three reasons .
[native] because it 's generally only in instances like this that the company sues .

[non-native] some people criticize that in some histrical , political , or other some cases which are controversial , making them understand could mean kind of brainwashing .
[non-native] then you graduate and go to university , you will still study there but less hours .
[native] african-americans have their own very proud history and culture within united states history and culture .
[non-native] first of all , nobody would believe me since it is impossible to know everything .
[non-native] another way to justify my point of view is to say that knowing young what we want to do after school is a good way to have a good knowledge on the topic and why not having a profesional experience by doing internships .
[native] so i guess you could say its a long coming for us ?
[non-native] in my opinion , to young people , time is lack to helping their communites becasue of their educating and more options for spending their free time .
[native] ucl , goldsmiths kings college and london business school , although all administered as if they were separate universities are still considered part of the `` university of london '' .
[native] but if small step by small step you heat the water , the frog will never realise .
[non-native] although there are some advantages to take a tour , i definitely choose to travel by myself .

[native] a weak europe constantly dependent on american hard power to maintain the status quo when the world is shifting to asia & china is our most important rival .
[non-native] i think young people can enjoy life more than older people .
[non-native] in this fast growing society , cars do play a major significant role , as they do be very helpful for quicker transpotaion , because time once lost can not be regained , and for the world twenty years from now , time would play a very prominent role .
[native] fairly certain mexico does n't feel threatened by american missiles .
[native] there 's no place in the british economy for silly ideas like ` society ' or ` culture ' , only gdp .

[non-native] but , of course , i have some ideas and information to say .
[native] it 's funny , nobody i knows , even people who were around for oliver j never heard of his anti semitism .
[native] and that 's not just my opinion on the matter .
[non-native] because one of the reasons people forget materias is that students did n't understand concept of the material even they learned before .
[non-native] but we have to go deeply in this field to demostrate another side of this way if living .
[non-native] beyond the doubt , when the facts are examined , its advantages and disadvantages weighed , and biased opinions casted away , it is not difficult to draw the conclusion that to travel in a group led by a guide is the best way to travel .
[native] [ that 's a bold strategy cotton , let 's see if it pays off ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ru8dmw-gry )

[native] paying them unemployment benefits ) is subtracted from the ` uk natives ' column and not the ` eea migrants ' column .
[native] quite the pretentious little bugger , is n't putin ?
[native] it is also useful for europeans to utilize russia as their own boogieman , which not only helps to cement the necessity of the european union , it 's economic integration , and the concept of common security , but also maintains the united states heavily invested in the region .
[non-native] for exemple people will always need to go to market , to travel , to visit and to go to work they need for that the cars .
[non-native] strong mind can make do something difficult from the person .
[non-native] there are many great scientists , politicians , poets who are considered very sucessful by our society .
[non-native] first few years of teenage is spent in studying , after graduating jod search starts .
[native] the recent set of adjustments are not currently needed by the eu .
[non-native] taking the chance to really find your talents is important .
[non-native] the continuous growth of population coupled with the strong social image of automobiles , unpopularity of mass transit systems and price decreases indicate that a decrease in the quantity of automobiles is not possible for the near future .
[native] the divide on the left regarding ukraine is very similar to the divide over the ussr .
[non-native] so going by all the norms one can safely say more cars to be in use then ever in the next twenty years .i disagree with the issue that a person should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialise in one specific subject because of many reasons .
[non-native] so the success depend on the work of people .
[native] this does not mean that any law that 's put in place that harms an investor is grounds for suing , rather the laws just have to be non-discriminatory , else the company would have grounds to sue .
[native] but as it stands , that is not the case .
[native] they 're apathetic because they do n't form groups to lobby the government .
[non-native] hence , the government resources were not available on time .
[non-native] he or she can take up the job of consultancy later on in their life .
[non-native] if we ca n't take risks and try another things how can we develop new things , make new discoveries .
[native] we will see how long russian pride last as prices keep rising .
[non-native] for example , nowadays , by developed madical skills , people can live much longer than before , which means somebody have tired to discover new cure and medicine , so that we can live comfortable and healthy .
[native] they used to keep the effigies a close secret , perhaps they should do that next year .
[native] as a consequence , i can recognize typically unnuanced , ignorant , and shallow british criticisms of the cap almost immediately .
[non-native] as a child one enjoy a lot being in the kindergarden , and playing with the other children there isnt anything else more exiting than that .
[native] i think exempting 80 % of the world population from the treaty is what is bullshit .
[native] nobody wants the uk to leave but the uk leaving is less harmful to the eu than having a member who blatantly does n't care about any of the rules or values of the eu , so if it comes down to it uk exit is what they will choose .
[native] and let 's turn westminster into the english parliament and move the uk parliament further north , it 's unfair to scotland and the north having it in london .
[non-native] so unless the facts are supported with enough ideas and concepts the facts are never facts and there will be a black spot always if it is believed blindlyusually this statement is true now days , if you dont take a risk it is unlikely that you are going to change your current situation , obtaining a broader experience is a rich contribution to your overall performance in life .
[non-native] most of the young people now a days living away from their home land either for the purpose for study or working with some multinational company .
[native] you do n't even know my stance on the eu .
[native] one other observation , i went to dublin last year on my way to london ti visit family ( the flight was dirt cheap ) and it was amazing .
[native] perhaps quebec is an example of how it goes - quebec is remarkably independent ( as are many canadian provinces ) , but mainly because rather than `` ask permission '' , the provincial government began doing things at home .
[native] enjoy your 10 billion dollar carrier brazil , i guess brics got ta stay together .
[non-native] so finally i agree again this statements with hopes for future .in my opinion , the statement given is partly true and partly false .
[native] sucks for the bulgarians , but it will be interesting to see how a country dominated by gypsies will be run .
[non-native] second , unless we have a more environmental friendly and renewable energy source , cars would have to be abandoned .
[native] unification round these part is n't exactly a fresh idea either , the means are modern but the results are inconclusive at best .
[non-native] what i mean is that this requirement have bad influence on student .
[native] it 's a race to the fucking bottom and its so depressingly predictable watching all the major parties wheel out anti-immigration schtick .
[native] and yet eastern and southern europe is forced to sell their state owned companies and break up their labour forces and cut public spending .
[native] ** edit : ** out of respect to the people i offended , i 've removed it .
[non-native] understanding the concept will make the person researching that particular subject a versatile in that particular subject .
[non-native] it exceed the original products and give the consumer the fake idea .
[native] the unclos is very specific that if you hear a distress call as a coastal state , and you have the power to help a vessel in distress , you have to go do it , and the ships that have been on this mission the last few years have little else to do otherwise ( after all , they are military and coast guard ships ) .
[non-native] from learing different subjects , we can find new things in different subjects .
[non-native] to summarize , developing a specialization in one particular subject can be really intresting and exciting .
[native] even then , after the british withdrew following the revolution , there were many loyalists who moved to canada , which was still british .
[non-native] in sum i think that it is better to specialize in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
[non-native] this kind of misrepresentations are really common in todays advertisement world because of the companies aim to sell more product and advertisement agencies way of being more attractive .
[non-native] for example if during the afternoon you go along the streets in the center of the city you will see that is crowded : there are a lot of young people that are having a walk , to go shopping or just for fun .
[non-native] so to show the product better is the most important thing that you have to concern when you are making the advertisment .
[native] for most of your countries lifespan you have been one of the most racist societies on the planet .
[non-native] for me it is working in society in your own time by free which means volunteer .
[non-native] but on a professional level we need to specialize in order to be successful .
[non-native] in todays world we have come accrosed many robust and complicated products .
[non-native] in other words the lack of specific notions can be seen as a total unknowledge .
[native] depending on the suburb , you can get a fairly decent looking 3 bedroom townhouse .
[native] the lack of jobs is a problem in italy and not really being solved .
[native] man , have you ever actually watched squawk box ?
[non-native] in order to make this system preferable over the use of car transportation , the benefits of the system such as its being cost-effective and less harmful to the oaone layer than the car usage should be explained publicly .people normally think that people who try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well can have succeful life .
[native] i 'm not sure if a protest is a great idea .
[non-native] it really depends on if you want to give a chance or not , however if you does not try you still can be successful , taking a chance is really a good optunity for you to get new stuff .
[native] ( of course they were being a bit funny ) .
[native] they just go to the washroom where ever they want .
[non-native] for instance , advertisement creaters can only use twelve squares in an advertisement , however , if they attempt to use one more square in his advertisement , people who watch his advertisement would like to purchase the item shown by the producer .
[non-native] on contrary , having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is not a good way because a person who does it will not have time to study in depth all these subjects .
[non-native] eventhough they feel bad and disappointed after they purchase the product , it definitiely helps to show the product better .at the learning process wherever at school or homestudy , it is importand to teach students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
[non-native] there many disavantage when they only doing what they already know how to do well .
[non-native] i bought it through the tv shopping channel when someone showed that the knife could cut the cutting boad .
[non-native] another boy i knew last year , left as voluntear an now he has been working for 6 months in the south america .

[native] so we left our protected little island and came to war torn europe cause we were bored , and not to save europe while cowards hide
[native] ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_cities_by_population_in_new_england ) so at the very least we 'd need you to return the names to their rightful owners .
[non-native] if the advertisements were not made to be for selling , meaning if it only stated actual facts , the consumers will not even thing about buying them .
[non-native] today , it is difficult to live without having car to .
[non-native] not only in disease curing , in the investigation of a criminal case , investigators uses the ideas and develope concepts to trace the facts about the case .
[native] i 'm pretty sure the hundreds of dead kids would have taken it seriously .
[non-native] the other thing is that it is useful on their lives .nowadays , our society is surround by advertisements .
[non-native] as you can see , older people have more restrictions compared to young people .
[native] the greens were some of the most staunch proponents of an early shut down of the nuclear power plants , leading there to be a gap in production that was filled by coal .
[non-native] also to travel in a group can provide a sense of psychological comfort , by knowing that one will never be on her or his own .
[native] > unless poland signs a paper saying `` if you do n't sell to russia , you * will * get our business '' , this is all hot air as i understand it , they would n't be able to do this anyway thanks to laws governing procurement and competition .
[non-native] for all these reason i think that there will not be fewer cars in use in the next years because is really dangerous for the population .
[native] where sentimentality comes above productivity , and where people are denied entry to the country ( regardless of qualification ) on the dubious basis of `` we have too many non-british people ! '' .
[non-native] in summery , cars willadvertisemnts have been known as the sole source for people to know about products ; therefore , many people tend to believe all what they hear in media means .
[non-native] beijing is much larger than 10 years ago , and many people would like to buy houses in the rural places where the housing price is lower , while they have to work in the central city .
[native] it 's been clear that the nl is going to pay all along .
[native] the to would have killed several million of each others ' civilians , because remember , those two had quite the war down there .
[native] you are doing worse than cherry picking , you are making shit up off the top of your head .
[non-native] sometimes it is not only a matter of time but of upbringing .
[non-native] the another example is the invention of electric bulb , the person who invented the bulb invented the advanced form of the bulb , hence people who invent the new things with more effective results will be ready to take the risks .
[non-native] many people think that the cost of gasoline will increase and they will be not able to use gasoline to ride a car in the near future .
[native] loss of ability to cool the spent fuel technical term , `` loss of the ultimate heatsink '' .
[non-native] many factories build more cars to get more money , because everyone has a cars or more than one .
[non-native] they work with professionals when developing the movie , hire famous people and celebrities that are appreciated and loved so that these celebrities make the people believe that the product they are presenting has cutting edge quality and reasonable price .
[non-native] education requires always more from students without teaching them the real work they are attending for .
[non-native] if you watch sciencefiction movies , you quickly realise that in most of them , there are not even cars !
[non-native] whatever the reason is , it is true from my experience that the younger the people are , the less frequent they will join the community events .
[native] the same principle of importing some things and exporting others applies to a lesser extent for those things closer to the irish price .

[non-native] we all want that the travel guide we choose should be able to provide enough information so that we get our money 's worth .
[non-native] to access to the city centre , citizens have to pay a certain amount of money , which clearly show the government willingness to reduce the number of cars third , as new communication systems develop ( internet , mobile phones . .. )
[non-native] it is very difficult to understand and perform in the real life .
[native] even pharmaceuticals are under threat from india , and it is rapidly being outsourced as well .
[non-native] in this case the risk could pay off and give him success .
[native] is the uk approach just more conservative , so they ban drugs as they come out much quicker ?
[native] but i 've also had very good doctors who take their time explaining and helping me understand any issues .
[native] that 's true , but the problem is the limited capacity per tower .
[non-native] today , i believe that advertisers have come to realize that it is much more effective to convey emotions and concepts related to the product than to state its wonderful and nearly miraculous properties .
[native] > 45 % of uk export is to the eu .
[non-native] in addition , i would rather studying the academic subject of one specific subject because future occupation needs professional knowledges .
[native] for the most part it seems like trivialised fighting , and i know countries voice things domestically which may sensationalise and trivialise what they say privately .
[native] surely the main point about britain 's benefit system acting like a magnet would remain if the uk left the eu ( correct me if i am mistaken ) .
[native] i do n't have visions of being some renowned individual who changed the world for the better .
[non-native] if you know all must know you can have success in all a proverbs say its the strong an capacity of a person who work hardly the lazy call luck so this is my opinion about this subjecteverybody will admit that a birthday celebration with young people is generally more cheerful , colorful and full of fun than a birthday with older people .
[non-native] first of all , nowsdays , the sociaty needs expert that means deviding works into many parts and ask the expert on this aera to solve the problem he 's good at .
[non-native] for example , one of my friend love to sing but does not know how to dance .
[non-native] younger people have an advantage that they are able to move quicker and stronger compared to older people , so i think younger people would enjoy sports more than older people .

[non-native] there are three reasons for this : safety , skills of foreign language , and convenience .
[native] i live in a former colony and the irish influence is everywhere .
[native] if i could have dinner with any famous person , it 'd be putin , hands-down .
[non-native] i agree with the fact that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are because that 's the best way to win customers .
[non-native] ours is a developed city , it has developed by forming group of people in to community .
[native] > it 's about rememberance who are you trying to fool ?
[non-native] first , government tries to make a policy to decrease numbers of cars , as they face with the problems which are caused by cars .

[native] sectarianism in england and wales hardly exists any more : even the last bastion of it in the liverpool v everton rivalry is now more or less gone .
[non-native] what successfull is depends on the product , but many times one can spot admiration or other positive feadback from friends and envy from competitors .
[non-native] if the statement claims that in sixty or seventy years fewer cars will be in use than today , not in twenty years , then i would agree to it .in this period of time advertisements have a very strong impuls and influence in people 's lives .
[native] so yes , they have no fucking idea what they want .
[non-native] in addition , if cars are still produced from today until twenty years and people kept buying , there wo n't be enough land to move our cars on , it 'll be always crowded and uncomfortable .
[non-native] before the invention of the conputer , people could be regarded as intelligent people with numerous just memorized facts .
[non-native] however , my friend said , ` the cechanic is coming , i think the job suit him better and i am for the computer .
[native] it would ruin people 's dreams of being called `` the federation '' though , since there 's already one right next door .
[non-native] the young people travel to enjoy in their life and they want to know about the others counteres .
[non-native] for example , when people are discussing in an every day life conversation or about news from the world , they have to know about what they are talking about .

[non-native] they can now draw a picture showing the directions of the forces acting on the ball and retrieve the formulas easily form their sketch .

[native] also , russia is full of * really * empty and unprosperous regions in the far east and siberia .
[native] regarding the cap , do you think the problems with it are large because of the implementation ?
[native] it 's not a matter of political control or pandering to separatism , it 's simply a practical necessity in order to ensure the supreme court has the necessary expertise to handle cases relating to quebec law .
[native] crimea is more like the bay of pigs invasion .
[native] you might as well get it over with and move to texas , because that 's exactly where you 're headed .

[non-native] but this is not true , because knowledge is an ocean whose depths are unknown .
[non-native] let me introduce an example to enhance my claim .
[native] saying i 'm an ` open borders advocate ' despite me numerous times saying that those that claiming asylum and are n't deemed to be refugees should be deported .

[native] what really gets me is all those `` pro russians '' claim they hate the west , and that america and its allies are evil corrupters , ignoring the fact that their smartphone is an american apple phone , or a south korean samsung phone , and not to mention america and its allies have higher standards of living and less corruption that russia .
[non-native] consequently , i enjoy life very differently today than 25 years ago , i.e. some things i found pleasure in as a child are today meaningless or boring , such as hours on the playground , or even repulsive , of which i will not give examples .
[native] whether there was a popular vote on it was entirely a national decision .
[native] i think people should disregard the opinions of somebody who calls themselves `` mastrgenocidest '' as mindless ramblings of a narrow minded nationalist who thinks 8 % of the population is worth more than 92 % of it .

[native] and there is no concern of random countries ( outside the balkans ) engaging in border disputes of military proportions .
[non-native] but the knowledge of the former will be clearly more superficial and inaccurate in every field than the knoweldge of the latter on the area of their competence .
[non-native] they must learn the facts in order to have their own about topics instead of memorising the consepts and the ideas which have already been known .during the first reading of this task i have already made my choice .

[native] my concern is of the xenophobic sorts living here who say , unabashedly , that they wish to interfere with the economic system in order to impose a british protectionism upon it , so that `` british '' comes first , and that both quality and quantity ( both in goods and the producers of those goods ) are denied in favour of putting some figurehead of the same nationality in place instead .
[native] > the political scene in canada is much more liberal and progressive than this country and its piss poor excuses for political parties .
[non-native] to improve its knowledge , we have to learn facts .
[native] when has fox news ever been critical of the republican party ?
[native] i meant more along the lines of / r/europe frequently losing their shit because some idiot called themselves `` irish '' or `` italian '' or whatever without fully understand the difference in cultural context .
[non-native] there might be some cases that some people always feel depressed and they do n't like their life , but in most of the situation , i think people will prefer to be happy .

[non-native] even more , they wo n't show those characteristics that makes the product cheap on the at .
[native] apparently ukip now want us to leave the eu without even holding a referendum , so that could become tory policy too .
[native] if they do , then we could well see a sinn fÃ©in government , and while sinn fÃ©in is not exactly establishment , they 're a household name due to the fact that they were the political arm of the pira during the war in northern ireland , and they 're also horribly corrupt .
[native] the ussr bureaucracy as an entity was corrupt to its core and betrayed everybody .
[native] the sanctions are in place to discourage that from happening and only seem to be increasing while russia investment in the region has been minimal , so we 'll see if the long-term goal is anything other than ensuring the port of sevastopol stays in their hands .
[non-native] there are developed nations , developing nations and underdeveloped nations .
[non-native] it is impossible to me to look deep into the future to find an answer but , for now , i would certanly hope it .
[native] assuming i 'm back to being reasonably lucid and not still suffering from whatever insane breakdown caused me to do it in the first place .
[non-native] i think it is important to change their behaviour .
[non-native] thats the reason i agree to have specialization in academics .i disagree little time that young people nowadays help their communities .
[non-native] in addition its really very hard to any citizen to wait for government mass transoptation , who is in an emergency , or planning to go for picnic with his family members or so and would be perfering to have his own car than rely on any others .
[native] here are the graphs from the article too : [ global debt ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5vegvm6.png ) [ households ' liabilities , us vs europe ] ( http://i.imgur.com/camqdke.png ) [ china leverage and gdp growth ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kjqmd1f.png )

[native] we 'd probably end up with a hilarious situation with australian uni 's empty of aussies cos we all went to study in europe , and australian uni 's full of europeans that wanted to experience a sea change .
[native] and ` safe ' according to experts , empirical analysis , and the like .
[native] have some italian friends at university ; best coffee , best pizza , and despite being hard workers , they have the most wonderfully relaxed outlook on life .
[non-native] so old people can not enjoy the life as much as the young people because they have financial problems , they may be suffering from chronic diseases moreover they dont have so much energy to enjoy thier life when compared to the energetic young people .nowadays the sciense is advancing very quickly because of the progress of many academic subjects , each day we know more and more about our world , about us ( human ) , the scienses is growing so fast , many people thinks that its better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects and other that its better to specialize in one specific subject , i think that its better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , my point of view is support for the following reasons :
[native] that 's really not the case , and anyone that thinks so has probably been reading too many fringe economics/finance blogs .
[native] i think you can be pretty sure that it 's sarcasm with the small type on the bottom of his unedited comment claiming that it 's sarcasm
[non-native] therefore , i agree that successful people are ones who try new things and take risks .the lives of youngsters have changed a lot throughout the years .
[non-native] the older people hardly find time to enjoy as they are busy with their work , thus young people enjoy their life .
[native] personally , i blame : - poor oversight , transparency and audit scope - corruption and conflict of interests - massive media dominated dialog between elected representatives and their constituants - pro-privatisation adjendas ( or wasteful public spending ) that undermine competativeness i have no problem with the wealth or private life of politicans ( ` top dogs ' ) , provided they act in the interests of the nation .
[non-native] the young people acting egoitic , because it is their choice what they wanna do in their free time .
[native] ` culture ' and ` religion ' are n't real things , they are embodiments of one 's beliefs .
[native] civilians die in war . . thats a newsflash for you .
[non-native] on the other hand , some of the parents are trying really hard making money so that they would have a better life after the retirement .
[native] like i said , the average person does n't concern themselves with israel 's business .
[non-native] when there was a chace to volunteer for the work in rural area , it was hard to find the students who were willing to go in my school .
[non-native] lets take an example to better illustrate the stand on the topic , thomas edison was the one who invented the bulb .
[non-native] but the advertisements want to make money , so they just make the products seem much better to make people wo n't know its good or bad inside .
[non-native] they make it look good and sell it .`` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities . '
[native] and more importantly where are these imperialist tendencies taking shape ?
[non-native] this fact shows me that the author of that textbook pocus on the concepts rather than just pointing out the facts .
[non-native] they can be based on the purpose to sell , the use of your desire , and showing the good part to persuade you to buy their products .
[non-native] it is a kind of trend among young people to participate in projects of npo or other group doing volunteer activity .
[non-native] second of all , you can not be free enough with a tour guide .
[native] very surprised i rank farther left than the snp according to plotting against the uk parties .
[non-native] but the little boy chose the colorful one so the coloeful one win anyways .
[non-native] since the information age is the new age , education is nomore about being informed rather it is about how being informed and what information is the best or more accurate .
[native] so we should kick out the multinationals then and that will improve things ?
[native] europe as a whole is under economic pressure from decreasing market share , which will certainly not help that other balance of payments problem that you neatly avoid mentioning : that between the eu and the rest of the world .
[native] just was concerned that throwing bananas at black people was `` in '' inside italy for a minute there .
[native] a lot of people dislike me on ideological grounds .
[native] accept it , do n't forget , but move on with your lives .
[non-native] in conclusion , both broad knowledge and special knowledge are needed and it pays to find a balance way to combine broad knowledge with special insight .since the technology is getting more and more advanced , people 's lives improved a lot .
[native] if there was a move for orkney independence in the new scottish republic , you can be sure the left would be cheering it on .

[native] i imagine setting up free travel between anglo countrys like the eu would be a plus , like a citizen of america is a citizen of uk and vice versa .

[native] both 16 and 18 are arbitrary delineation between being a child and an adult .
[native] i did n't say they were n't in a conflict .
[non-native] the reason for this that generally people always believe in advertisements and they do not try to know more about the advertised products in order to collect more detailed daat about them , because this kind of people choose the easiest way to get information about new methods , new innovations and they try these product without any advices from professional people .
[native] wwii was by far the most destructive single war in history .
[native] next time i 'm in germany i 'll be sure to give a good ol nazi salute and sieg heil and then remind them all it 's perfectly legal in america .
[native] none , we all live in oligarchies or top-down unrepresentative power structures of some form ( plutocracy for example ) , the only difference is how many concessions they make to people to keep them happy .

[native] while its great for ukrainian students it sucks for russian ones who have no real political power to change things in ukraine .

[non-native] as reinstated in my answer understanding is important , it can not be compared with learning .
[non-native] a man which has always lived following this principle .
[native] then again , a lot of cadbury 's chocolate that is consumed in ireland is made in ireland .
[native] you can get them back if the other country allows it .
[non-native] i also hope people would try to use less theirs cars even if they pollute less .
[native] > a. it suits the situation too neatly of course it suits the situation neatly .
[native] my final concern , though , is what if money is simply funneled to weaker countries who then misallocate funds and the eu as a whole fails ?
[native] any kind of measurable reason , or just one that you , and i 'll say it again , `` make [ ... ] up whenever [ you ] want to suit [ your ] preconceived notions ? ''

[native] and the manner in which you have conducted yourself in this subreddit , expressed your views and now alienated me only for my nationality as a european resident all leads me to think even less of your opinion .
[non-native] for example , in some cities as london , frankfurt , rome , etc . ..
[non-native] they drink , dance , and hang out with their friends all night long .
[native] i 'm a young russian immigrant and from what i heard from my parents , uncle , grandparents , and generally on the internet , it can be summed up as `` shitty '' .
[non-native] i think they do , because only a few people make the right choice when they are young and because we have an illusory vision of youth .
[native] even in the case of france , it was more of a `` what the fuck , we kind of expected support '' kind of thing than a `` we absolutely need your support '' kind of thing ( not that we were right to get upset either way . . it was an odd time in american history )
[native] given the number of dialects , you 'll find * someone * who thinks it sounds weird , no matter what .
[non-native] in addition to this , while human beings watch the television , they can be effected by some meals shown in a channel .
[native] there 's sooo many flags and such glossy pictures .
[non-native] the case of sports , for example football , to run or move quickly , we need the good phisical abilities and sensors .
[native] i think i was using `` democratic '' wrongly .
[non-native] because i dont know abou how drive at that time my father give driving manual for car driving .
[non-native] however , for several reasons , i am convinced that in the next twenty years , the use of cars is going to decrease a lot .
[native] originally a lower house district was set at a mere 30,000 people , it slowly inflated to over time .
[non-native] this last can never shape things or invent new things as he does not have the capability of thinking by himself .
[native] i do n't see why it should be done in france .
[native] i was near one , kinda hard to miss the yelling and screaming , and because it is a commotion i had no idea what was going on so we checked it out and that is when we found out what was going on .
[native] this comes back to propper transparency and auditing to align risk correctly rather than ` forcing countries to issue bonds ' , which is what an ` injection of capital ' seems to imply .
[non-native] as the number of cars increases the fuel consumption in countries would also increase leading to a fuel scarcity and hence price rise .
[native] archetypical example : the president of the united states .
[native] the eu is n't about military power at all though , so that will never happen .
[native] more people are dying from bullets than ebola , yet ebola is all we here about .
[non-native] on the contrary , and especially in our times , becoming old is often seen as horrible and everybody tries to stay young with creams and other chemical products .
[non-native] my conclusion is we should study to '' understand ideas '' not to learn facts .
[native] he does n't have to plan anything , he just needs to hire someone willing and able to do his dirty work , which i imagine there are people lining up for that .
[non-native] so i would prefer a mixture of generalized and specialized knowledge .
[non-native] cars have been in extensive use ever since it was made about a hundred years ago by ford .
[native] you simply can not compare people waving a football team flag and people waving a isis flag and all that it represents .
[non-native] for instance , with a tour guide people have usually a tight schedule .
[native] and i do n't see how i ` oppose condemning people who support isis ' .
[native] it 's ` aussie ' , and i did n't claim it was down to bloodlines , i listed a number of things , such as my languages , citizenship , residence , heritage , etc.
[non-native] first , if you specify in one specific subject you will have a lot of knownledge of a specific subject in contrast to people who rather have a broad knownledge .
[native] but do you really think that this kind of racism would be so accepted in the west that they could be so open about it ?
[non-native] for example there is a difference between the knowledge of an engineer and a doctor .
[non-native] however , in my opinion , i disgree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .
[native] also , there will probably be a similar amount of chinese and english native speakers a century from now , with china 's population likely to start declining significantly before the end of the century because of the massive drop in the birth rate .
[non-native] sometimes , we are required many information from modern society when we want to do something like writing a report an so on .
[non-native] for example there are so many boys and girls that dedicate their free time to helping poor people , or to visit sick people , or simply help an old woman to cross the street .
[native] ultimately , what does it matter if spain is one nation , two or even three if all political entities participate harmoniously in the eu , but with the self-determination and recognition that comes from being your own nation ?
[native] back then this is what the rational scientists believed in .
[non-native] i 'm now 18 years old and my all life long i studied and i am really not sure when it is going to finish .
[non-native] when people share their thoughts about common things , they easily get closed .
[non-native] taking risks comes in way of trying out at new things .
[native] the uk has never been into , preferring instead to be at arm 's length and only getting involved when shit gets nasty on the continent .
[non-native] my boss told me that the fact was whatever you cooked , the most important thing was the customers liked it , especailly about work .
[non-native] i have studyed a lot of theories , for instance the theory of monopolio , porter 's theory about the four forces that are important in the regulation of enterprice 's business , but our professor spent less time on the cases , on the reality .
[non-native] because they do n't really know and not skilled about it .
[native] and i think you 're a nut that ca n't back up your arguments , which is why you respond to the same person in 10 different places instead of carrying on a single conversation in one threat of comments .
[native] we need to sell our oil , the usa uses it as a political tool to gain votes by not building it .
[native] the cold war does n't technically have dates , but it 's commonly thought to end in 1991 when the ussr collapsed , but even the 90s by the sound of it were really shitty .
[non-native] he can go to cinema in the afternoon , go to shoopping in the evening and go to a concert with their friends at night .
[non-native] the young people i.e the group of people between the age groups of eighteen and twenty-five who are mostly graduates and under graduates will have lot of work to be done in the university in terms of assignments , mid term exams , publishing research paper , submitting a thesis at a college or university , etc and it would be unfair on the community people to help them in the social work .
[native] and democratic capitalism has proved to be perhaps the most adaptable and resilient for of social construction we have ever developed .
[non-native] but responsabilities do n't take away the exitement in life .
[non-native] by understanding the purpose of their education , students feel that school it is not something which is imposed on them , but will help them to deal with educational challenges in their future life .
[non-native] 10,000 only by every member and now infosys is a global softwre company .
[native] freedom of people under government is to be under no restraint apart from standing rules to live by that are common to everyone in the society and made by the lawmaking power established in it .
[non-native] the argument can proved in all other areas not only in science .
[native] because we 're an island they seem to think we do n't need to be in the schengen .
[non-native] on the other hand , life is more difficult and quikly than 100 years ago and the young people do n't go to the community because they go in the city to study and when they return at home they are more tired .
[non-native] the original intention might be innocuous but it may lead to addiction or even death .
[non-native] bill gates is that kind of example that makes me think that this risking , sometime innovative and brave people are , in some occasions , also very important for the evolution of mankind itself .from every travel , what we get at the end are just a group of memories .
[non-native] but , the people driving this changing mindset , are certainly the younger minds in the business .
[non-native] advertisements are made to sell the product and for that they do make the product seem much better than what it actually is .i agree with the statment that young poeple enjoy life more than older people do .
[native] new zealand is mostly personified as zealania , [ a really stern looking flag-pole babe ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/all_hail!_zealandia.jpg ) .
[non-native] young people can enjoy life more than older peolpe , but young people must care old people .
[non-native] unfortunately , false advertisements lead to a waste of money and loss of trust between customers and sellers .
[native] the irish have met every single last agreement or dead line so far so i 'm sure you will have your money soon .
[native] if he does ` t , maybe the bundesbank will .
[native] both advocate a more direct democracy , but in different ways , and podemos is supported by the much more radical elements in spain , like the syndicalist unions .
[native] a well balanced , moderated , and interesting debate with some important european figures on the ttip participants : ** bernadette sÃ©gol ** , secretary general , european trade union confederation ( etuc ) ** markus j. beyrer ** , director general , businesseurope ** stephen fidler ** of wall street journal ( moderator ) ** carl martin welcke ** r , vice president , german engineering association ( vdma ) ; company owner and manager , schÃ¼tte gmbh & co kg ** monique goyens ** , director general , european consumer organisation ( beuc )
[native] scrolling down to the very bottom and seeing this was a pleasant surprise , thanks for the laugh .
[native] > you can not have single open european market and government subsidies at the same time .
[native] > it is known that only high ranking caucasian play this superior sport .
[native] i did n't make a prediction based on the past , i was pointing out the historical difficulty of italian military ambitions in africa .
[non-native] therefore they spend more time for social purposes , for instance going to parties , which could lead to the assumption that they are enjoying life more .
[native] like the question he was asked there about the divide between northern ireland and ireland and whether it is religiously based .
[non-native] there are really many reasons why i belive this but in these essay i will limit my self to mention two , the first consernes the far distance that people have to acheve to go to there work or some where else , the second has to do with the incresing number of people in the world .
[non-native] they need to practice the topic by themselves to make sure that they actually understood the sheme of the topic .
[native] arable land vs agriculture land seems to be a big difference .
[non-native] if the person is at the undergradulate level , it would be wiser and more beneficial for his rest of the life to take a broder knowledge than just in specific feild .
[native] honestly , i agree the west should have stood firm sooner , it took a while for european governments to react but the idea that the west is `` in bed with these guys '' is absolutely ridiculous .
[native] [ nail on the head there ] ( http://img.pandawhale.com/86039-reddit-bronze-meme-medal-r3ddi-mbqn.png )
[non-native] according to me successful people are those poeple who willing to take risks and are ever ready to try new things .
[non-native] innovation could give you a new way of doing thinks .
[native] do n't know , this is news to me .
[native] you got me , you managed to see through my facade .
[native] lol , forgive me for the owners of musgraves or dunnes care any less for their workers in this race to the bottom .
[non-native] i would like to finish with giving an example from myself ; i graduated from business administration , i worked in a travel agency , in a factoring company and at the moment working for a non-profit organization as an expert on the european union and i owe all this to the broad knowledge of many academic subjects i learned in school .all peaple in this world injoy their life in the way they can and the way they want .
[native] you 've never said the name `` trudeau '' around an albertan , have you ?
[non-native] i can say with may experiences that there are a lot of young people that spend their time to helping their communities .
[native] still love the uk and canada 's shared history with them .
[native] i hear switzerland 's not in the eu yet .
[native] the eonia is the interbank rate , it is not the rate at which governments borrow .
[non-native] the solution for this problem is to built many stores in a rural area , but it is not easy and realistic .
[native] laws should n't just be put in place because the majority want it .
[native] what i 'm objecting to is you painting all of australia as a multicultural utopia , when it 's clearly not true .
[native] the beer is good , but far too gassy to be comfortable after a while .
[non-native] for your lives , new things means new points , new status and new value of your careers .
[native] a person who is in a country they are not a citizen of , are either visitors or trying to attain citizenship .
[non-native] his social and personal obligations would keep him occupied all the time .
[non-native] my thought is also supported by a holiday trip i made in april this year , when i went to california in the united states .
[non-native] the second reason is since every person can transform the informacion in diferent ways and for some people can be easy to understand new subjects in the class , like the `` history of mexico '' all the concepts , what happened in the past , but definitly that understand it , get the main idea with their own words , will be able to remember it in the future years .
[non-native] as an example i can say about a friend that owned a pizza store , he was always trying new ways of mixing ingredients to produce the best pizza his customers could have ever eaten .
[native] australia tried this with aboriginal children and it was a disaster , genocide effectively , as it eliminates the culture .
[non-native] as a result , the consummers , who are the targets of the advertisement , may think that the qualities of the product are better than they are actually .
[native] any more and you 're getting into bad territory .
[non-native] for example using comparative advertisement method : say to the costumers that theyr products are different by the others .
[native] ( except for certain street elements , who were terrifying ) .
[native] the race is emphasized because race is a much bigger part of everyday life and history in the united states as opposed to europe .
[native] ** edit : ** an i 'm not just saying this for myself * ( although ... i 'd be lying if that did n't have a large part to play ) * .
[native] there will always be arguments for non-intervention in an interventionist world , just as there have always been arguments for intervention in a westphalian world .
[native] so when i say all foreigners and citizens of other nationalities were killed or expelled , and then poland fell under communism for 70 years preventing immigration and promoting a homogenous population due to the iron curtain .
[non-native] since the life in the 2006 is caracterized by the fact that nobady has time enough , oll the everyday situations are becoming faster and faster so people in 20 years will `` run '' for all the day .
[non-native] i believe that twenty years down the line the infrastructural facilities would have improved so much that it would eliminate travel by car to a greater extent .
[native] the syrian civil war , hezbollah in south lebanon , etc are legitimate issues for israel when it comes to its borders .
[native] in this instance , calling the president the `` head of government '' is n't accurate .
[native] they blew up a civilian airliner thinking it was some cargo plane - i do n't think they give a shit who gets hurt on their little vacations .
[non-native] there are no working troubles , no compitition , no anxious feeling about want to do about their own future .
[non-native] i could throw really fast at my dad , but my dad could n't throw that fast .
[native] something tells me that that these stats were `` calculated '' by european firm , hence why the eurozone is doing quite well .
[native] one thing that is captured poorly in the pinyin transcription is that the chinese sound for sizzling is actually pronounced `` zzzz zzzz '' : `` zi '' is a syllable-long `` zz '' when pronounced ( pinyin is a pretty chaotic system )
[native] with over one billion living in poverty globally , the race to the become competitive is beginning to look like a path to misery .
[native] the best way to assess the capabilities of nato is to test them along the edges of the alliance .
[native] hungary is in a real bad situation politically , orban was probably the lesser of evils , and he is a dictator and does what he wants , and does not represent anywhere near the majority of hungarians .
[native] do you think it was wrong that they joined the euro ?
[native] i 'll even edit my comment to make that clearer .
[non-native] sometimes you might even laugh , when you see something is free .
[non-native] so thats is a i agree with this statement .sticking to ideas and performing the same tasks over and over again give you the possibility to become more and more elaborate or professional in this task .
[native] maybe only 20 % of the israeli population has been killed ( 10 % of the jewish population worldwide ) , but the israeli polity has been utterly destroyed , and there is no hope of it being militarily liberated , at least in the near future .
[non-native] another good example can be even a scientific subject as the chemistry .
[non-native] all of these questions could not be answered only by observation .
[native] > i think the city of london determines the agenda .
[non-native] finally , advertisements only show the merit of products .
[non-native] by this his undrstands his aim and work to reach goals .
[non-native] in television most products that are being advertised , really does not work .
[native] in fact , hawaii would be hurt more in this example than crimea would , because it would disrupt a lot of trans-pacific trade .
[non-native] today , there is much more discovered than in former times so you even have to learn much more to get along in a certain profession or academical direction .
[native] it 's also extremely unlikely that a couple who could afford a surrogacy pregnancy can only afford one child , unless we 're talking about government subsidized surrogacy .
[native] either you choose to help or you do n't .
[non-native] doing what one knows best sounds like sensible advice .
[native] the jobs thing is because often there are minority hiring quotas companies need to meet .
[native] > but percentage-wise to your economy you were paying less i 'm not sure what two things you are comparing here .
[native] one would think that if israel were the democracy it claims to be , that if israel is the civilised society it claims to be , that israel , the more politically , socially , technically , and militarily advanced country would take a step and stop breeding extremism with its radical ultranationalism .
[non-native] conclude , i agree that it is better to know many subjects than to know one specific subject .i beleive that having abroad knowledge is agood idea , but after having that huge eruption in informations , could this be possible ; the answer is `` no '' , because the student will spend all his life trying to cover all the academic subject .
[native] not really anything rare , i do n't think many people want open borders , that would be a disaster , just making it easier/not any harder to immigrate .
[non-native] keep in mind every single possible society 's reaction it is not that crucial .
[native] it 's nearly 75 % of adults are overweight , not obese .
[native] if you are european and you arrive in the uk without a job to go to , you can sign on for unemployment etc.
[non-native] making the advertisment better is one of the way of making the company better .
[non-native] he can open another coffee shop near the central station , the third in the street , or he can develop a fundamental new concept of selling goods .
[native] > if the situation does n't change radically are expats allowed to vote and if so are there measures proposed/in effect to prevent that ?
[native] but seriously , these people should be shipped to murica , and western europe , as it is they who caused them to flee their countries .
[non-native] if you only follow the leaders of the group you would not feel pleasure of achievement during the trip .
[native] austria , italy , the netherlands and portugal did the same but introduced an additional quota system for labour migrants from the eu8 countries .
[native] it kind of irrtates me how the perscription for balanced growth between countries with trade imbalances is for the more competative country to become less competative ( through wage increases or fiscal transfers ) or by expecting their citizens to buy more goods or services from struggling countries .
[native] after the fall of communism , yes , but not before .
[non-native] tour guides are professionally trained and experienced with the country they are guiding in .
[native] go watch `` bar rescue '' if you want an idea of what poor service does to a bar .
[non-native] young people , while they are busy with their academics , still find time to enjoy i.e in holidays .
[non-native] it is certainly true that there has been an evolution towards societies more based on individuals and it is also true that the time shedule of the people have started to be impressingly filled by many activites .
[non-native] by the above points with for and against i can strongly accept the statement `` after twenty years there will be fewer cars i use than there are today '' .it 's surely important to the students to undertand ideas and concepts and maybe it could be more simple to explain to their in that fashion , especially when it 's for exemple an math course and you consider that it 's either not important , or is not their level yet .
[native] i just do n't see what relevance they have to this issue .
[native] not sure how it works in the eu , but in the us , you are regularly interrogated during your green card application if you are applying through marriage .
[native] and it is :) the rising that led to irish independence happened in easter of 1916 , while we did n't get independence that day , it 's universally accepted as the day that things kicked off and the whole process started .
[non-native] i was blinded by the advertisment and bought the shoes .
[non-native] as they grow up they start think about problems increasingly .
[non-native] besides , the producer of the advertisement can even use some lights which indicates that people who watch this advertisement would like to buy the item shown by the producer as soon as possible .
[native] otherwise the kids first experience of learning is that they do n't belong and it is not for them .
[native] if you feel more at home in a country you were n't born in that 's good for you but you should n't let it cloud your view of your own nation .
[non-native] however , there are some people who say that most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are .
[native] none of them were formalized , and now they are vanishing .
[native] i , for one , believe that the uk , france , italy and germany could easily defeat a russian invasion in europe .
[native] bah , than my apologies if i got carried away .
[native] both movements are fairly euro-skeptic and lacking in political and economic literacy , it 's bizarre really .
[native] what is the worst-case scenario for sweden if russia invades ?
[non-native] advertisement , it is the major force that makes the product of a company to be sold .
[non-native] young people tend to enjoy their lives from activies which older people can not handle very well .
[native] i for one ask for seoul , the dublin of the east , to raise a glass with me that we may toast each other 's fine love of the grain .
[native] do you want unlimited immigration from europe ( mainly rich and white ) but not from africa ( mainly poor and black ) ?
[non-native] every day i am going to school in car .
[native] > helsinki-berlin is n't necessarily the goal though , there are other capital cities on the way and even if the train itself goes all the way , most people would probably only do part of the trip , with very competitive travel times .
[non-native] for instance , the rabel of foods says only main materals .
[native] it 's really more of a glorified rickroll at this point .
[native] it may have been a lawful decision by a sovereign entity , but that does n't mean they 're not due compensation .
[native] our system of morality is still strongly influenced by the legacy of protestantism likewise in korea and japan temple attendance is poor .
[non-native] history gives ample examples of people who chose a different pathway for them altogether to achieve succes in what they believed .
[native] [ i think you 're getting confused with the states ] ( http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02261/chain-gang-road-2_2261570k.jpg )
[non-native] of course , old people can enjoy life well , however , they do not have enogh power and energy for enjoy .
[non-native] but they dont understand the concept of the chapter or working of a particular componentand , eventually when they finish there educations they will not have ability to implement the concept to develop a product because they have not understood the concept well .
[non-native] we live in an information age in which we have access to a sea of data .
[native] the maastricht treaty states that all signatories are obliged to join the euro at some stage .
[non-native] but by specializing in one specific subject one can get depth knowledges of one field .
[native] > the main argument that people make against eu immigration in the uk is that unemployed brits could be doing these jobs to quote from the [ migration advisory committee 's analysis of the impacts of migration report ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/257235/analysis-of-the-impacts.pdf ) : > our results indicate that inflows of working-age eu migrants did not have a statistically significant association with native employment over [ the period 1995 to 2010 ] .
[native] the ira were / are a terrorist organisation , did that factor into your comment ?
[non-native] if it is so then it is a lie or maybe a trap .
[non-native] for instance , i 'm studing fashion design and i want to became an important fashion designer so sometimes i must make some renunciation to obtain my goal .
[non-native] and since there is a tour guide , the opportunity of occuring some bad things may decreases .
[non-native] i think products should be professionally compared to their commercials before viewing them in the media .
[non-native] sometimes people think because they understand ideas and concepts they will reach the fame .
[native] i 'd suggest , if you 're really interested , that you read a little more about us society before saying things like .
[non-native] this happened because the new ceo expanded the business into other areas deemed risky like telecommunication , water resources and control solutions .
[non-native] to sum up i would say that after having learnt and understood something , the idea is more important , but while learing this particular thing , we can not separate the idea and the fact .cars have been considered to be one of the most important inventions of mankind , which went a long way in enhancing his mobility .
[native] if you look at my comments , i 'm not exactly anti-nuclear .
[non-native] thus , they will avoid the need of a tour guide .
[non-native] another inconvenient factor of traveling with a guide is that you can not chose the sites you would like to visit .
[native] each piece of regulation should be judged on its own merits .
[native] all of us would be better off outside of the eu in its current form .
[native] but i 'm not the imf or the ecb , and they have the money .
[native] bear in mind he wanted to destroy parliament , which is more than just the king .
[non-native] consequently taking risk is necessary in todays world more quality requires some risks but may be sometimes this risks results can be hurt us but all of us known this no pain no gain .the world is turning to be a more demanding place , especially when refering to the work enviroment .
[native] rhetoric is just an excuse to cover up the actual reason .
[non-native] therefore , as time goes by , it might hard for them to remind the material and remember again .
[native] i agree that your rephrasing does n't make sense .
[non-native] in the concludion , many advertising are so different from the genuine thing .
[native] the power in images/symbols like these require a deeper knowledge of a culture than most foreigners have .
[native] > because the majority of the people wanted it ?
[native] our prime minister joseph savage summised the national mood quite well `` it is with gratitude in the past , and with confidence in the future , that we range ourselves without fear beside britain , ** where she goes , we go !
[non-native] so i think that a reliable way to value a risk is that to think about its consequences .
[native] regarding leadership in europe : guided by the leading economic state may sound harsh to corrupt/inefficient countries but it seems like a reasonable model .
[non-native] like this , many advances have been made in the means of travel such as bicycles , tricycles , motor cycles , trains , ship , planes and ofcourse the most convenient means of transport - the car .
[native] see here is the crux of the issue - electing a government based on promises they subsequently break does not give them immunity and legitimacy in implementing austerity .
[native] if you incorporated wales into a [ flag combining england and ( northern ) ireland ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5v6na3m.png ) the same way ireland was added to the [ flag combining england and scotland ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pht8g37.png ) , you 'd actually get something closer to [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yvo33lm.jpg ) .
[non-native] depending on the upbringing some young people can be very methodical , working very hard for their future and are often in a constant battle against time to get a place in society .
[native] in this way the uk is no different to every other member .
[non-native] well , first of all , in my perception young people are simply more active than older people .
[native] sounds similar to how crimea was given to ukraine .
[non-native] we can also take an example of a computer engineer , where every fact and concept about the machine counts a lot .
[non-native] but my current school helps us understand what we are doing .
[native] people tend to forget just how scary nuclear warfare is , and just how long western leaders will have to think of it 's cost if , for say , russia launches a lightening strikes on the baltics and deploys tactical nukes there with the threat of using them if the eu tries to dislodge them conventionally .
[native] ok , muslims are more likely to be terrorists these days in western countries .
[native] the northern region , like scotland , has aspirations to leave the united kingdom .
[native] the dream of a united ireland is nothing but sentimentality at this point .
[non-native] for eaxample , when you recognize your specific subject you can choose your best subject .
[non-native] because to travel in group , and to travel in alone or a few companion , both have advantage and disadvantage .
[native] some conservatives think that voting conservative is likely to maximise the chance of a brexit .
[non-native] so , in view of all the above reasons one can agree or come to a conclusion that in the coming future , it may be twenty years or some hundred years there is no chance of decline in the usage of the cars .nowadays almost everybody can afford a car , something unimaginable a few decades ago .
[native] in their last conflict azerbaijan lost by a significant margin , hence why there still is the nagorno karabakh issue .
[native] but the paper is old , i posted it merely to demonstrate that sovereign immunity was a valid concept in civil law countries .
[non-native] in this sense , i would rather that specializing in one specific subject because it strengthens people 's exciting studying circumstances .
[native] hardly anyone in the us even knows who they are .
[native] incredibly , the eurozone seems to be waiting for the godot of global demand to float it off into growth and so debt sustainability .
[non-native] tube , aeroplanes , urban buses , fast trains . ..
[non-native] then , journalists put forward your activities and all the risks you are able to take .

[native] this group is militant and violent and they prey on the naivety of european leftists like yourself .
[non-native] this is very important do give relevance to the years that i spent at school at first and and at universty after .
[native] something that not many places have managed to pull off .
[non-native] with the building of new highways and better roads that even penetrate to the most deserted places in countries the need and urge in people to obtain a car that is suitable for them is growing .
[non-native] because they already know that will be dangerous and affect other people .
[non-native] as an inevatible result of these facts , in twenty years will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
[non-native] if you do something every body , you miss the `` wow '' effect .

[non-native] the young people , on the contrary , do not know their limits and may take their enjoyment to such a height from where return might not be possible .
[non-native] third , the atittude and the atmosphere that the students have learned through their school years which amount to a total of 10 years or 14 years if you include university education provides the basis for the rest of their life and people still keep their old habit .
[non-native] i visited spain this september on my own , and became acquainted with travelers from us , france , morocco , and china on the train and at football stadiums , and we exchanged information on the best places to visit .
[native] those countries deal with refugees considerably less pleasantly than sweden would as well , which would mean it would be tacit support for that too .
[native] if all the countries in the world recognized them they would n't have a seat ?
[non-native] after knowing the effectiveness on thes efacts the students will be more positive in nature .
[non-native] moreover , some academic principles are currently revising this issue in the universities and trying to come to a sort of strategy whether to keep the doors open for any student to take broaden his/her knowledge or put some restrictions on it .
[native] it 's ok politicians do stupid shit all the time .

[native] we 're family friends with a half nigerian british expat .
[non-native] all in all , i think car companies are still on a thriving market and therefore , there is little chance that in twenty years thre will be fewer cars in use than there are today .it is more important for students to understand ideas than learn facts , the human has long memerise and short memerise .
[non-native] now i am going to deal with what i think would be the best way to do in life .
[native] p.s : i 'm aware of their private circlejerk sub
[non-native] fortunately , there is people whose work is mainly focused on providing those types of services to the community , but this should n't deter us from trying to improve ourselves , that 's it , to reschedule or find a bit of time during the weekend and to bear in mind that the next generation will behave accordingly to what we teach them .for old people , they have experienced all kinds of events , delightful or frustrating , so the life has already been a past process .
[non-native] might be true the fact that a part of young people does not help the other person who need their help , or does not put their ability or competences for a ` better word` , or simply a ' better local community` , but is also true that there are so many guys that every day make their ` good action` , or work hard for a right ideal to find a sense in their life .
[non-native] realy ihop that , because i want give to humanity all helpe , iwant to you , if you can give to human help , do it and not stop , do it in your knowledge .in my openion , i do n't agree with the statment that mentioned in the question and i belive that studnets should undertand ideas , concepts and also learn facts .
[native] fair enough , i just could n't find it myself and refuse to believe anything that is n't sourced .
[native] calling someone an `` oriental '' has a racist undertone though .
[native] but the +37 next to it makes it easier !
[non-native] this is not very ackward since our economy and social traits have had a tremendous shift .
[non-native] in ten to fifteen years , those personal air-crafts will spread out magically .
[non-native] then , the software benefits many people using internet to chat .
[native] however we will not be buying any more military equipment from you guys since you bent us over and dry fucked us on the last purchase we made .
[native] people did n't like the megathreads , so maybe an optional filter like / r/worldnews uses for big issues .
[non-native] further it is illegal to tell the customer facts which are not true .
[non-native] for example > when you have a cardiac desease you would prefer go to a cadiologist with a phd to go to a doctor who know just a little of every desease because you do not know if he or she can help you .
[non-native] some people can easily fall in love with a subject just because an affection on the spur of the moment , as soon as he realizes that he wo n't be able to catch up with the course whatsoever , he will just simply drop halfway .

[native] many sinn fÃ©in grass-roots supporters are indistinguishable in their sentiments when compared with other european nationalist movements , even when such sentiments contradict official party policy ( e.g.
[native] alas , it has that same sense of overbearing melancholy that persists in so much of polish cinema .
[native] i do agree that there is a place for buying irish though , it can help companies getting/maintaining a foothold which allows them to produce for cheaper .
[native] it 's kind of sad that that 's how most of the world thinks , considering the amazing polish vodkas i 've had over the past few years .
[non-native] the second reason for my belief is that i can make other frinds in different areas .
[native] please note this is sarcasm , i dont support uncle pooty .
[non-native] on the other hand you see how nature shows the powerful human beeing that mother nature 's sources are nearly empty and that there is no chance of producing gas in such a short time , like people like to have it .
[native] the people of londonderry would probably say the same .
[non-native] in order to be successful , it is , in my opinion , essential that you make some progress .
[native] as for your ` increasing demand ' theory : that only works if there are the jobs to give the money to the consumers , who are expected to increase this demand .
[non-native] my opinion is older people enjoy life more than young people .
[native] the fun for me was watching top gear when it seemed like the bbc officially switched to metric for a few seasons then gave up .
[non-native] third of all we all know that the cars are actually pollutiing the nature and has got many bad effects on the environment and on us therefore the scientists are trying to find ways to solve this problem which means that they will find a better way for transpotation which will be faster , safer and that will not pollute the weather .
[non-native] but now , how can he communicate with others , to feel others and to show his feeling towards others , to mix and organise things related to the world of other subjects .

[native] france has also been quite protectionist when it comes to danone ( a bit old but still ) .
[non-native] infact a successful person is a person who wants to make the difference .
[non-native] this is also made by the staff in the stores .
[non-native] on one hand when i travel with a group led by a tour guide , i am limited with the place indicated by the tour guide .
[non-native] perhaps some scientists are currently trying to come up with new ideas to replace cars in a environmental friendly way .
[non-native] in the modern day car has become the status symbol for a man .
[non-native] therefore a guided tour may be the best way .
[non-native] but finally understood the way of solution , i could solve another math questions .
[non-native] when i accompanied with a male guide , he solved every problems and arranged all reservations .
[native] i do not hate the individual people of the usa , i hate the government and the way the usa treats canada .

[non-native] of course i do n't think that a specific preparation ist't correct , it can be use to have a better preparation in your kind of work and a possibility to be more essential that other people , but for some personal reason i prefere do n't have a specific preparation , but a more large vision on various argoument .
[non-native] last , but not least at all , people that try new things not only have to deal with risks , but sometimes with failures .
[non-native] that would , no doubt , decrease such misguiding advertisements .
[native] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gini_coefficient#mediaviewer/file:2014_gini_index_world_map,_income_inequality_distribution_by_country_per_world_bank.svg india 's gini coefficient ( wealth equality ) is as good as any european country ( better than the uk even ) .
[native] every if it is 50,000 , there are 150,000 ukrainians living in moscow alone .
[native] 2 ) there 's also no legitimate referendum or vote that allowed the crimeans to `` self determine '' .
[non-native] third of all , the only advantage a tour guide can give me is to show me the best places to visit or let me aware of the nieghborhoods in the city i am visiting .
[native] they also plan to include turkey but are a little iffy and are debating wether to allow for morocco , lebanon , israel , iran , kurdistan etc.

[non-native] in sum , i prefer travelling on my own to travelling in a group due to the less freedom when you are in a group , lack of chances to meet native people from other world and losing chances to explore things in the new places .
[non-native] i believe that if you do n't let go the things out , if you just close your life and you do n't look higher of what you have , life can become pretty plane .
[non-native] nevertheless , human tastes may vary and therefore find some advertisements less effective than others .obviously , it ca n't be denied that most advertisements try to insist on the qualities of the advertised product , and cautiously hides their dark side .
[non-native] but i did n't give up and i can realise the smart way to think next time for better .
[native] we saw that in the 1930s , and that 's what scares me .
[native] at the end of the day , for as long as transnistria is n't actually threatening the security or integrity of the rest of moldova , it can be something that can be deferred past eu membership .
[non-native] an example which supports the notion that understanding gives the bases of any subject which can further be expanded to opt for the research in any particular field .
[non-native] as a result , young people have to move away from the technology that has been drifting them apart from their community , and they have to be taught to study with a program so it will not take that much .
[non-native] however , the oler people may prefer to live in a traditional way , since they do n't want to change their life style after living under the same one for ten or twenty years .

[native] people then think , hmm , the truth must be between `` russian-backed separatists obtain russian spec-ops to shoot down plane using russian equipment '' , which is the most pro-ukraine position , and `` ukrainian junta fascists shoot down civilians in false flag to smear glorious rossija '' , the most anti-ukraine position .

[non-native] as the above experience shows that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is safer than travel alone or without tour guide .
[native] my worry is that they will turn more paranoid , nationalistic and authoritarian because of it .

[non-native] based on this considerations we can try to figure out if there would be less cars than today .
[native] you do n't understand the concepts that you persist in acting as if you 're an authority on , the sources that you use tend to be from conspiracy theory websites , or from groups heavily biased to your view , and you have a tendency to edit your posts even hours after other people reply to them , completely changing what you wrote .

[non-native] but overall one can not say , the young do n't dedicate enough time to support worthy causes .
[native] the islamic forces then fled to malta where their language remained in use ( bilingual to italian though ) and then maltese eventually developed ... ( mostly from semitic and italian ) .

[native] hey , i 'm the one who 's defending goulash and even i 'd answer that call .
[native] take heed people , this is why you want a centralized power base .
[non-native] so , i strongly accept that a student has to understand ideas and concepts .
[native] there is one point about 75 % believing israel do not have the right to exist , which is different but unfortunately does n't suit your argument as well .
[native] how many countries have had a passive-aggressive territorial dispute with denmark over a place i 'm pretty sure neither of us want ?
[non-native] let 's take the battle of thermopylai as an example .
[non-native] first , as you traveling in a group led by a tour guide , tour guide will let you know every single thing you need to see in the journey .
[native] there 's a good 30 seconds to a minute while your brain works out that what you 're seeing is actually real .
[native] this story is the worst as yet for those of us brits who actually believe in the european union .
[non-native] your super visior is waiting from you discover some thing which isnt say before .
[non-native] on the contrary , the old are always filled with the feeling that they have already make their life ; they are constantly thinking about the day of their death , and that is why , in many cases , they do not pospond themselves in the future , and adopt a dejected attitude towards life .
[non-native] in the many years to come , other kinds of transportation might be invented .

[non-native] i do not know exactly how many humans there we will be in twenty years but i have heard it would be around 7 milliards .
[native] it has always existed , since the very first civilizations .
[native] how do people get so worked up about something which does n't affect them ?
[non-native] in addition , it is only possible to develop facts in the light of ideas and concepts .
[native] you know it 's a slow news day when stuff like this is at the top of / r/europe .
[native] > for example , regarding the range of russia 's aa missile batteries stealth capabilities would be a plus over here but not as much over sweden .
[native] but than again , we were n't foolish enough to try & implement a currency union without a proper political union and no will for a fiscal union .
[native] trucks on the syrian border with weapons in their so called '' humanitarian convoys '' .
[native] you destroyed one at sea ( do n't mess with the royal navy ) and the other landed at the wrong place and was encircled and destroyed , the irish army sent to relieve them had to leave defensive positions and march across ireland resulting in it 's destruction and ending the last war in which ireland was almost equal to britain in strength .
[non-native] second , joining a tour group will give you the chance to know information telling by the tour guide that you did not know them before about the places you visiting them .
[native] genius , i ca n't think of a single reason why nobody has tried implementing that before ...
[non-native] we did have a lot of famous wars or events in history and they all have their special meanings at that time .
[non-native] so when they see something , it can be powerful and it can give them fun .
[native] i do n't get all the hate for eurovision though - sure , most of the performances are tacky and over-the-top , but overall it 's entertaining and fun .
[native] 1 stone throw = 1 concern did n't you do the maths ?
[native] it 's also easier to a make a new start because there 's much more slack in the spatial planning , as opposed to europe where every scrap of land already is occupied and probably was for centuries .
[native] lol they already are in eu ... ( hopefully someone out there knows what i mean )
[native] sorry , my french is shit ) plan from `` free mobile '' in france ( 19.99 euros ) ?
[non-native] for my part , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years .
[non-native] another advantage of having a tour guide is that he or she can help tourists find good places for shopping by suggesting certain shopping areas .
[native] the entire world would be dragged into our media apocalypse .
[native] syria is not as religiously diverse as lebanon , where there is a much larger christian population .
[native] instead supermarkets must * offer * the food to charity .
[native] i do n't know , i found that part unclear , but i think he is implying that the christian times were part of the `` bad years '' .
[native] china is actually a weird type of oligarchy : rule by the few , except that `` few '' is not that few , and around a few hundred party elites .
[non-native] if you have been successful and started a life which really counts to you e.g. you have a good job , a settled life with a famliy and kids and a house ( in my opinion exactly that is what winning describes and what lifes is about ) , you must be a fool to risk that .
[non-native] otherwise , you fail your work and no one cares about it .
[native] well , ukraine is guaranteed to lose its eastern regions it seems .
[native] it 's amazing how quickly people adapt and project recent events onto years past .
[non-native] their success in trying something new has led to an outcome beneficial not only to themselves , but to all of mankind .
[native] the ability to compel it 's member states to comply is a central part of any union worth a damn , and historically the uk has been foremost in pretending they did n't know that when they signed up .
[native] we have a free trade agreement with china , and that did n't allow corporations to sue our government and limit the ability to regulate the domestic market .
[native] i guess it 's important to remember that while there are cultural similarities between us , there are many differences too which manifests itself in politics .
[non-native] if subject is more interesting to him then he can find out time to learn more information regarding that subject .
[non-native] in another twenty years almost all the cities of the world would boast of such an efficient system of public transport that not only it would be more convinient to travel by such modes but also it would be more economical .
[native] however because scotland will need to negotiate terms of eu entry there have been talks of putting border guards and passport controls on the border .
[native] as a matter of fact , i do n't expect department of defense computers to have any sort of anti-virus at all .
[native] i appreciate the sentiment and where you 're coming from , but i would not be surprised in the slightest if this woman wishes she were dead right now .
[native] was there something about canceling the poland celebration in russia ?
[non-native] i was suprised , then i asked the seller he said it is not free , you just pay monthly or weekly as you like .
[non-native] this statement can be clearly explained with the help of an example , lets take civilengineering into account , civil engineering is an unision of 6 areas of specialization namely foundation engineering , structural engineering , environmental engineering , construction planning and management , water resources engineering and transportation engineering .
[native] well the turkish saray comes from persian `` sara'i '' meaning `` palace , '' or `` inn . ''
[native] while both are horrible things and totally immoral , the conditions that brought them about , and the intent when sentencing people to these two styles of camps , were different and they should be viewed with a different approach , not with the view that they are simply the same thing in two different places .
[native] the rebuilding took many years and even today some houses are still being rebuilt or renovated , some are being now brought up to their original image by adding details and finishing touches which during the 60-70 were impossible due to lack of funds , the reconstruction effort being a state initiative until the 90s .
[non-native] in this point they ca n't be blamed for that .
[native] and now his futures going to be even worse :(
[non-native] first of all , young people have healthier and stronger body than older people do .
[native] the fact that this neo-nazi battalion is fighting with bravery is of no conciliations considering what they see themselves fighting for .
[non-native] i am totaly agree that successful people are the ones that who try the new and take risks even if i can not be taken before .
[non-native] for example , some of the well known businessmen are always try to produce and sale new things .
[non-native] they not only just want to sale their stuffs and they hope to understand what the costmer want and what they need .
[native] i still think that the referendum will result in scotland staying in the uk , but it will be pretty close .
[native] my suggestion : [ anglosphere unification ] ( http://i.imgur.com/d4ruxmy.png )
[non-native] probably , the concepts stem from an operation of synthesis of different facts under a unique point of view , but when a concept is understood , it can be used as a tool in different situations .
[native] i do n't think anyone does select media at random .
[non-native] for example in olden days in the sense in the nineteenth century the means of transport was mainly by buses , cycles and trams , but after the foray of the cars into the world of transport it revolutionised the field by not only providing luxury , and comfort but also people were able to reach their destination in time .
[non-native] but facts alone , i believe , can not be consider enough for somebody 's growth .youth is one of the more common subjet in litterature or in social behaviour .

[native] there was an olympic rower just yesterday , and he is a total babe ;)
[native] it is relevant because we can not pretend they are n't war criminals just because the kangaroo court in the hague overturns a conviction .
[non-native] one such example would be medecine , where students had to have biology and chemistry , as well as taking the umat test , to see if they are suitable for such a course and also later on such a job .
[non-native] i think advertisements should be besed on the products .
[non-native] moreover , in many countries , several political leaders have conducted a special policy based on the development of public transports such as bus , plane , train etc .
[native] people may be wondering why the scale switches direction between the maps .
[non-native] while they are doing this untrue presentation , the companies do not prevent them since it is for their advantage .
[non-native] for example , if i have a store that sale house ornament , it is necesary to have all kinds of neon sings that make allusion of the product on sale .
[native] having core principles does n't mean you never change policy or implementation of those principles .
[non-native] although the cons are important points to be taken care of still cars are one of the precious things that the people perceive as their primary part of their life .
[native] the average voter is [ wrong about almost everything ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/british-public-wrong-about-nearly-everything-survey-shows-8697821.html ) , they do n't care enough to inform themselves , and they 're easily swayed by a cheap suit and a charming smile .

[non-native] hence i am for the topic that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than to specialize in one specific subject .
[non-native] finally , i conclude that though there is no harm in working on only doing something that a person knows well , but i think that would make life very stagnant and our advancement will be badly hampered .
[non-native] these companies have a great knowledge in human psychology so they are trying to do their best to persuade the customers and make their products sold .
[non-native] a disadvantage of having broad knowledge is that this sometimes means , that you are less familiar with each subject .
[non-native] what is flexible person for me is , to think about wide range , and can think about by standing other person 's position .

[non-native] today people more use cars than in twenty years ago .
[native] you do realise that downvoting me does n't make me wrong , or more wrong , right ?
[non-native] advertisements make the products seem much better than they really are , another reason is that the advertisements only show the good points of the products , they never let you know the bad side of it .

[native] - the skills of the irish workforce are excellent and the irish services sector is extremely good .
[native] not really ... probably more like grozny or sarajevo ... . but i get what you 're going for ... .
[non-native] why we go to eye specialist when we have an eye problem rather than a general physician .
[non-native] for example somebody who tries to pass a hard test to have access to a better school he is in but who do not succed or somebody who take risk and setlle a new business which fail few month latter .
[native] yes , but that was invented by cow fucking australians .
[non-native] additionally , most of the tour guides have contacts with local merchants and attraction managements .

[native] is n't this an argument against other countries integrating with italy ?
[non-native] certains areas are to remote to acces them by any other way than by car .
[native] > think how much of a blow that would be for the british banking sector most of our banking sector growth is now coming from outside the eu .

[non-native] because most of their works are completed on the computers .
[native] if they 're fighting purely to defend ukraine , then why associate themselves with nazi ideology , maybe it 's because they also see themselves also fighting for national socialism , especially the neo-nazi mercenaries who join their ranks from elsewhere in europe .
[non-native] in the contraty , if i had interest and knowledge about , for example , german literature as well , aside from the major in chemistry , it would be possible for me to get acquainted with german people as well as to join a literature club .
[non-native] scientist have made predictions about the future saying that by a certain period of time there will be fewer cars and instead of using gasoline in the cars use another alternatives ways .
[non-native] for example , insurance company 's selling piont is the efficiency and complete service whenever there is a claim after a car accident .
[non-native] since we are talking about close future , maybe we will wait much longer for changes to be seen , because , let us also be realistic , more and more people own a car nowadays , it is indeed so comfortable to own our own way to move from place to place in such a short period of time .
[native] i do n't have time to waste reading shit conspiracy theorists send me without references .
[native] > it all depends on why one country is more competitive than the other .

[native] trying to tell these morons that those issues do not come from eu immigrants .
[native] it first spread through bloodshed , christianity did not .
[non-native] if they can not help the community atleast they should not damage it further .
[non-native] to explain better my point of view i 'll take some accademic subjects as examples .
[native] and the food ... good god man ... the food here is amazing !
[non-native] there is a hard competition for a good place to work .
[native] that is , nothing more than a very small minority may disagree with socialism .
[non-native] the behavior of teachers is to push students to develop their own analysis about different subject more or less important .
[native] or would they be in apcs and respond stronger and earlier .
[non-native] first , it is more oppertunities that the new things bring to success than the old things .
[non-native] for example the store aldi in germany sells many different food products .
[non-native] in a time when people are saying that globalization is at its best do we see this trend to decline .
[native] it would have been pretty tough for them to fuck it up though , given that most people in the soviet union were nowhere near being fully atheistic .

[native] there 's so many damn exceptions to the rules , the rules are the minority .
[native] the old town was completely restored as the pre-war image .
[non-native] because ther is a hioghly degree of fighting spirit .
[native] `` i rang up and asked , ` where 's the meeting ?
[non-native] in my opinion you should not lie to the customer because this will infect your company negative on the long run and you are not only responsible for your margin , as well for your employees .i think that is better before to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because in this way i can enlarge my knowledge and learn all that is possible .
[native] these pictures , was this during the kyiv protests at the beginning of the year when yanukovich 's private abode got taken over by the protesters ?
[non-native] we can easily aplly the statement to the world of working people .
[non-native] that is why i agree with the statement .in my point of view the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts is right to a certain extend .
[native] since that does technically make the latter countries somewhat dependent on the countries those companies originated from .
[non-native] we go to some retirement associations to chat with old people .
[non-native] they never mind taking risks during reaching thier goal .
[non-native] i think the answer is , a mix of both .
[non-native] the main reason why i agree with this statment is that a person when is young have more energy than older people have to do a lot of things , and this energy let one enjoy life more than not having it or having it lees , an old man had lived more than a young one and saw more things and had more experience in life so he or she would be tired of life and would not enjoy it as like as a young one do , a young person is still freash minded so he or she would still have alot of ideas and a lot of beutiful things in mind wanted to do to enjoy life and in a young age she or he would like to do everything he or she could do in acording to enjoy life and would have more pationt to do such things than the older people do , also their are a lot of enjoyable things that older people can not do because of their age otherwise an young person can do it easily ,
[native] `` jobs for the boys '' if i ever saw it .
[native] that data is n't very impressive given that the eu 's population is nearly 200 million larger than the us and it 's total output only a fraction higher .
[native] [ most people would n't think this was the uk ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/04/04/article-1373273-0b7aa6c400000578-14_634x437.jpg )

[native] > i 'll just ask what basis does scotland have for independence that could n't be applied to yorkshire or lincolnshire or sussex ?
[native] politically , the lack of compulsory voting in europe is something i do n't like , we 've consistently had above 90 % voter turn out since 1922 when we made it compulsory to vote ( it 's just a small fine if you do n't , $ 50 from memory ) , i 'd be much happier if this was implemented in the eu .
[non-native] my grandma , grangpa , father , mother , sisterand me together to chat with each others .
[non-native] the example is that one of my best friend who wants to be a successful medical doctor , he is eightteen years old and he has only one promblem that is facing him and this problem is haveing a good grade in toefl to be accepet in the university , even this is his only problem , he is not working and practicing to have the wanted grade .
[non-native] the reasons and examples listed below will explain my point of wiew in this situation .
[native] - both had large colonial conquests - as a result of colonialism , both have small island territories dotted around the world .
[native] there are costs and benefits to being in the eu .
[non-native] the destiny may be anything like office or a party etc .
[non-native] however , the car technology is being imploved everyday .
[native] sure , we 've stolen a fair portion of the poles .
[non-native] anyway my point is that both of them is good .
[non-native] now , infact , there is changing in the life not only of young people , the dayly work is different also for the time that it had in a day , with a lot of people working from the early morning to the start of evening , so they may try to help the communities only in the weekend if they do n't work .
[native] i feel sorry that his words were more `` interesting '' , because hers were more worthy of the breath they were carried on .
[non-native] however will this tide of cars will stop in some day .
[native] also , it should not include the usa or canada .
[native] do n't be fooled by all the ranting from people who do n't understand what austerity is , eventually it is a force for good .
[non-native] knowing facts is very important but we always need to think , and i believe that it is more important to have better understanding of things and concepts to make good decisions in real life .
[non-native] to know how to learn things the way they were taught in the book , you can read through the main facts and details that was given to you .
[native] ignoring the american cultural context of what people are talking about when discussing their ethnic backgrounds is a very euro-centric view of nationality and ethnicity .
[native] > and the spearhead of this movement develops a very convenient cancer and mexico devolves into a failed state and ... > are you saying we gave the leader cancer ?
[non-native] the statement looks better to read on the paper to have many academic subjects , but in practical it would be very much tough to acheive it , although there are people who are persuing many specializations , ideally it would be suggest to have one specialization .young people have always been seen as a future of their community and are expected to work for the betterment of their community .
[native] russia is filled with lying psychopaths so i already know who i believe .
[non-native] for example , in the city i live in , start to pursause the residents to decrease the frequency of using their cars because the way can help to improve the quality of the air in this city .
[non-native] colleges in the u.s. often consider the hours spent on community service when evaluating an applicant , emphasizing the importance of a student 's willingness to serve his or her community .
[non-native] the percapita income of any individual is increasing day-by-day .
[native] another is the damage to confidence and so investment and innovation from a financial crisis .
[native] i was beaten up by some polish people three years ago that were mugging me .
[native] podemos might be similarly anti-immigrationist - in which case , i see it as equally deplorable - but that 's not the impression i get from reading of it , even if it is eurosceptic .
[native] they want to limit immigration out of charity for poor romania .
[non-native] even the way we think , we see the world need to be changed as well .
[non-native] moreover , because of his ability of english speaking and his major , marketing , he got promoted quickly .
[non-native] second , they have longer time in rest of their lives than the older people do .
[native] seriously though , you 're right and it 's a shame .
[non-native] thus , it would be wrong to thing that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
[native] in which case no , i 'd say they could n't .
[non-native] on the other hand , i can take my time to visit , buy something or eat nice meals as long as i want .
[non-native] a second point is that one has to adapt to a certain grade to what industry and society needs .
[non-native] also , somehow their good economical situation makes them more individual , losing in some way the communitiy sense .
[native] i struggle to see how this could work though without seeing the details .
[non-native] the best example at this point is again the mathslesson .
[non-native] they can feel the feeling of the one who first find the theory .
[native] > let 's say i 'm a truck driver and i do n't enjoy the job really .
[non-native] students should really understand some processes , ideas and concepts , because this is what stays in mind .
[native] what about `` discrimination of persons based on skin colour '' .
[native] i know three european languages , and have lived for more than a year in each of three european countries .
[native] until they begin putting them into active service , we ca n't really determine if they 're a failure and personally , i doubt that they are .
[native] and hey , if you do n't think there are enough articles submitted about dirk inaction against sami and finns , submit some articles yourself .
[non-native] the teachers write down the roman numerals on the board and force students to memorize that there is no make sence why students should learn all about these kind of complicate questions .
[non-native] nevertheless it makes all the difference for the people that experience the help - just as it has always been .i think that the people works very hard and try some new things and give them the success .
[non-native] they also deteriorate bones in adults and cause growth hazards in children .
[non-native] today the man is progressing at such a fast pace that will only lead us to developing more and more cars with new technology .

[non-native] of course if there are no risks there are no mistakes and if there are n't any mistakes nobody can obtain a real knowledge .
[non-native] this leaves them with less time to help others .
[non-native] however , it is worth to challenge for the great success .
[non-native] i have heard it from my parents and from my teachers who always put the emphasis on studying hard to lead our nation .
[native] i guess what i 'm getting at is that all those yellow `` vull ... '' banners are really leaving me the impression that catalans are viewing independence as the promised land and that it 'll automatically be everything that spain/madrid is n't .
[non-native] i even heard news that these people provided shelter & food to those who couldnt get to their homes due to lack of trasport .
[native] that said , cross border shopping has its advantages and derry is a great spot for a drinkin sesh
[native] i even read the article , but in both cases my eyes skimmed over the non - clause .
[non-native] students are only one who make bring out nation forward .
[non-native] moreover , once they become a subject expert , they can really harness their mastery over the subject , by doing consultancy projects , which can help them build , a satisfactory and rewarding career .
[non-native] if considering one same phenomenon , for example the incident occured in international diplomacy , the death or birth of their relatives , or anything , the feeling or knowledge older people have is so deep and quantitative .
[non-native] in india , a decade ago there was only one car giant called maruti udyog limited ( mul ) .
[native] on another note , i was eating at a greek place a while back and ordered a turkish coffee , only to be told quite angrily that , `` like many other things , the greeks invented this style of coffee , and the turks merely appropriated .
[native] well , uh , blame the east anglians who moved here and named their new homes after places in old england ?
[native] i was just thinking of people at random really .
[non-native] it is convenient because we do not have to plan the trip .
[native] i 'm just saying that taking the time period when they 're paying money in and then lauding that as showing how immigration is beneficial is highly misleading .
[non-native] by making good relationship with these elderly , the young people try to understand their sadness , and they try to find the meaning of peace .
[non-native] i have a friend who is a wonderful harpist , and she practices her harp at least 9 hours a day .
[native] while i do n't necessary disagree with any of the points here , this is still total pro-west propaganda .
[non-native] however , it appears that their knowledge are not very good .
[native] my post was in the context of your hypothetical where that happens .
[native] when external threats arise european states do n't hesitate to meet them together .
[non-native] without fundamental knowledge one can not go to the destination .
[native] do you close your eyes when you get to the bit in the history books about how disliked the easter rising was by the irish , or the very law support for nationalist parties ?
[native] since then , i 've kept a keen interest on large trade issues , such as this and the tpp .
[native] you 're acting as if none of these people are pissed off that the guy they elected was kicked out of office in a coup twice .
[native] i do love americans telling me that i am an asshole with an inferiority complex simply because i am glad canada does not want to sink to the level of the usa , but i am not surprised as americans are very quick to go to insults and childish language .
[non-native] in fact , the public school system should provide a core understanding of science , arts and humanities .
[native] this means that those companies `` can not lose '' because they represent their country and have close ties to the government , enabling them to get massive state support , distorting competition .
[non-native] the concept of what decides a requiremnt should be understood rather than just knowing the requirement .
[non-native] let 's take an example of a student getting angry on his father for not providing him more pocket money .
[non-native] so i think the goverment will say the people who out the low not to use cars .
[non-native] not everybody have rich parents , who can spend all the money for their children .
[native] i am really at a loss for words when it comes to our corporate owned media outlets .
[native] isds ( investor-state dispute settlement ) is also a feature of most trade and investment treaties , and means that a country can be sued for imposing laws that unfairly target foreign investors .
[non-native] developed countries like the united states , the majority of european countries together with japan are experiencing constant demand of cars since more and more people are becoming independent and therefore need a car for going to work , for their spare time spent in travelling , reaching other people to different places .
[native] no it 's not , it 's not black and white which is what i 've been trying to explain to you .
[native] when i die i probably have spent more time in china ) .
[non-native] its always important to apply knowledge in one particular direction .
[native] there are people who want a federal europe with smaller , more balanced states and there are those who want a few larger countries to act as ` leaders ' - both are in the interests of europe .
[non-native] if the man wants to lead a luxurious life he must have a car .
[non-native] why lots of rich people are success , because they take a chance to try what they got and what is new for them , and they are not afraid of it .
[non-native] therefore , i guess that if the people know the problem , they will do something to avoid it .
[non-native] on the other hand , i tray to stady for identificate , my personality and leard each experiece whith other people .
[non-native] so these shoes were obivisius not that what they had to be .
[non-native] and maybe the stronger proof that i can done , it 's when you are in a somewhat difficult ideas and concepts , you are obliged to take in count the facts to undertstand the idea , because you ca n't did it whithout .
[native] the orthodox church is such a prominent part of greek culture as is islam to turkish culture , that neither are really comparable .
[native] all we can hope to do is give ukraine diplomatic support & under-the-table help .
[non-native] for example , when i was a middle school student , i would like to study geography since it provides exotic amusement and happiness .
[native] > i would say that currently , capitalism is failing eastern germany .
[native] not sure who would run against her in the primaries .
[native] something that could easily have been negotiated before it became a `` crisis '' .
[non-native] during the school days , i devote my free period to study and review the previous classes .
[native] do you just have a macro that says this every time someone asks you ?
[non-native] at the end of the day , to achieve the success we have to take risks and to try new things .
[non-native] but , since the change is brought forward in today 's society by the young generation only , there is a majority of younger people who enjoy their life more than their older counterparts .car is the most common transportation mean for millions of people : a passion for some , a necessity for most .
[non-native] people who are doing only they know , will mostly do one thing on their lives .
[native] some two thirds of the subsidies going towards wine ( notorious for the ` wine lakes ' of a decade ago ) are towards the grubbing up scheme and other structural reforms to make it competitive/change it to something profitable .
[non-native] taking all aspects into account , i strongly feel that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
[native] as is , both are very far off , and russia is many , many years behind turkey .
[native] thus , we can not expect chinese govt to ignore the needs of the people in domestic areas .
[native] this is the best you 'll get from me at the moment .
[non-native] indeed life would become very monotonous and boring if risks/chances are not taken and novel things are not tried .
[native] i 've always considered the option of settling somewhere in europe later in life , possibly not britain .
[non-native] in a very competitive market today , consumers always have a lot of different options .
[native] that 's not what i said at all , in fairness .
[native] i 'm probably one of the few here that do n't think that this is the right thing to do .
[native] winchester will be the symbolic capital , but bristol will be the economic capital .
[non-native] that was juch cheaper but made no pretence to being compatible with the ibm pc .
[non-native] most of the students understand the ideas and most the gust learn the fact for my popenion it 's better to understnad the ideas t 's easyer and it 's more helpfull .
[native] do n't you understand putin is going to take over ukraine to protect from nato .
[native] [ lanarch castle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/larnach_castle ) near dunedin is the closest to where i 'm from in nz , though [ bouzov castle ] ( http://www.veteranmuseum.cz/olomouc/wp-content/uploads/image/bouzov218.jpg ) in cz is the closest to my current location .
[native] and there we were paying back the loan at your high interest rate .
[non-native] the role of people in these days is ` reproducing ' from past informations .
[non-native] in according to my experience i agree with the statement that is , `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' .
[non-native] finally i think that the succesfful people are people who manage our world while the other people wait and see .
[native] in the eu i can find no such source , only official releases from the commission and the legislation they produce .
[native] do n't kid yourself , while we still have a way to go in defeating racism , looking out at most of the rest of the world , it is so much worse .
[native] poles work harder , for longer and for less .
[non-native] if students do not understand the ideas and concepts of formulas and how to work with them to find a solution for a particular problem then knowing just the fact which is just a formula would not help them solve differnbt problems of the same nature .
[non-native] on the contrary the elderly people , because of their experience , is more wise in making important decision about what should give up and what should stick on .
[non-native] during weekends they feel to have ecstacy or euphoria to get relax from the enervatin jobs donre by them trough out the week .
[native] yes , the ' Ä ' and ' Ä ' sounds can be hard to get right when speaking , especially in combination with ' Å ' .
[native] we ca n't afford 26 counties no mind another 6 .
[non-native] but its good to them only if they get the related ideas and concepts understand about the particular fact .
[native] also , europeans make crap coffee generally ( sorry italy , the quality of your milk just gets me down ) , so you can keep all your baristas thank you very much - when i was in europe and saw a flat-white on the menu , i was like omg yes !
[non-native] you can only earn a great benefit , if you are ready to take a risk .
[non-native] simply learning the formulas is not interesting at all as they consist of only letters and numbers .
[native] his/her argument that eurosceptics are thick may be offensive , but the fact that the economic benefits of immigration do n't weigh into the debate suggests that many people are uninformed .
[non-native] in conclusion , i am quite certain that a mix of both , specializing in a subject and also having a broad knowledge is the best option .i think that a successful person is more focused on trying new things rather than doing what he or she already knows well .
[non-native] on top of that , how could we explain a concept without giving any example ?
[native] it seems to be a bit of a mystery .
[non-native] in my opinion when those country will developt everybody would like to fulfill his dream and to buy a car as people from rich countries did .
[native] then we 'd see the eu for what it is - a vast racket for unelected politicians and lobbyists who make up discriminatory regulations and direct the 1 trillion euro budget towards special interests .
[native] > unless the guy 's claim was that he was n't an economist .
[native] > is there a reason why we ca n't just mow them down with bullets ?
[non-native] the world is getting more dangerous , most of people have guns and knife .
[native] the example i gave you was one where a government acted completely lawfully ( though not in accordance with nafta ) to intentionally discriminate against a foreign company .
[native] mandarin 's sound fuckup wrt older chinese being due to those damn manchus rather than capital dialect mixing ( why does mandarin 's sound system even further than manchu 's then ? ) .
[non-native] in addition , people can fall into things negatively like addicting because at first , they are not sure what it is and just start it .
[native] i 've encounter loads of sinn fÃ©in supporters who love to give out about immigrants .
[non-native] but the other way round not many young people are seen in theaters , hiking in the nature or in the cinema when the old western movie from 1950 is shown .
[non-native] well , if everything goes well for him , he will become richer than before otherwise he will lose what he has .
[native] do you think almost every icelander uses gay to mean ` bad ' ?
[native] it is legislation setting out the rights the spouses get in the context of genuine marriages .
[native] if it were done with the full consent of the government , as it is here , i would n't give a single shit .
[native] the new governments are generally not installed permanently by force , but by elections , which often produce not-so-friendly governments ( iraq ) .
[non-native] people should specialize in one specific subject in their studies .sure it is !
[native] the israeli leadership sees the end , and because the arabs can not penetrate much farther into the tel aviv area without enormous loss of life , agrees to an israeli deal that lets the millions of remaining jews to leave the levant .
[non-native] where i live , in japan , the young people do not spend their time for communities .
[native] i do n't know why it 's bad but i 've been told my whole life by people with an invested interest in the perpetuation of the capitalist system that it 's bad so it must be .
[native] ** edit : ** and how was europe * not * the punk here ?
[non-native] cities would grow bigger witnessing a major problem of faster transport due to conjusted roads .
[native] however , it would be incorrect to claim that japan mistreats women , or that japanese males are misogynists .
[native] france rebelled against british rule with us a few times .
[native] there was no history of islam in france , italy , germany , scandinavia , britain or a majority of other european countries before colonialism .
[native] do i reject anything you say because obama is a loon ?
[native] patriarchy is not explicitly about oppression of this gender or that .
[native] also ( probably ) lacking the intention of causing panic .
[native] i and every single one of my over three hundred million countrymen are arrogant overgeneralizing bastards .
[native] i do n't have the details on the case , and after reading some of your comments here i 'm not sure that you do either .
[non-native] for example , to design a bike , we have to understand the working principle and what is exactly required in order to make it work in an efficient way .
[native] export subsidies have dropped from the billions of euros just a few years ago , to zero last year .
[native] why does asking for two large beers in slovak sound strange to polish ears ?
[native] least ye 're on the map , be thankful for that .
[non-native] no longer duties only involve a very specific duty , but they require other skills because the scale in which things are done now , and the way communications have narrowed the world enable many things to interfeer with others .
[non-native] for instance , when we look at the life of successful businessmans it is very easy to see the risk that they take to reach the top .
[native] i really think that japan is underselling one of it 's greatest regions .
[non-native] both arguments seem to be contradictory , but taken together can result in greater opportunities in the the corporate world .
[native] he 's a troll who has [ done this sort of thing before ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/2kb047/the_schengen_area_1592x1427/clk1yem?context=3 ) .
[non-native] did you eat the best local food in japan ?
[native] the irish are very , very , very distantly related to iberians .
[non-native] it is very good for their mental healthy .in twenty years there will be much more cars in use than there are today , if nothing unusual like a world war happens .
[native] and the adjectival form is `` ferrous , '' not `` irony . ''
[native] there is n't some kind of rape epidemic compared to other countries because of immigrants there .
[native] there are russian nationalists too though , there are lots of books printed in russia that read like propaganda against the ukrainians , portraying them as subhumans .
[non-native] a student who prefers to study all the subjects will have to work much harder than the student who has only choosen specialization in one subject .
[non-native] the colors on the products might be shown much more brighter as it is or the little deficiencies might be hidden when it is advertised .
[native] > well , no wonder , you rephrased it into a straw man .
[native] eh , on wto negotiations , but a large part of that crossed over into ftas as well .
[non-native] but i think young people can enjoy living more than older people do .
[native] there 's speculation that the head of the semi-state body [ might be sacked over his handling of the set-up of the organisation .
[native] isolationism and engagement result is very , very interesting .
[native] if you want to say that europe 's involvement in ukraine had no bearing on russia 's decision to invade , then say that .
[non-native] its not agreeable with the statement that there will be fewer cars in use after twenty years because of several worth notable reasons behind it .
[non-native] at last by the above examples and points i personally think youth especially between age 14-28 years can enjoy alot than a older person .people try new things and take risks and some people do the things which they already know .
[native] you might be partially correct , in that humans are pack animals but a pack does n't have to be defined by the colour or your skin , the country you were born in , your religion or anything else .
[native] deaths not casualties , there would be a couple million more wounded and unable to fight .
[non-native] in history what it is crucial is the general setting of the period .
[non-native] we need to understand here that it is not that they have to do this , but because they choose to do this which in turn is simply because they enjoy doing it .
[non-native] and because osaka gas company started to sell the environment friendly boiler , eco-will , which is cogenaration system for redidential , i applied to work for osaka gas .
[non-native] by doing so , the youth makes a significant contribution to the economy of their community .
[native] lots of words are loaned from chinese , does n't change a language 's historical ancestry , which is the only thing by definition that matters when putting it into a family .
[non-native] in our twentieth century world , money is one of the biggest issues for most people .
[native] > to prevent private interests from forming an oligopoly like gas companies agreeing not to under cut each other for example that 's forming a cartel , and is already illegal in all western countries .
[non-native] you have the advantage to separate you from the mass of other students or applicants .
[non-native] i would collect data from intruments such as internet and books and ask friends how i can do well .
[non-native] the father would not give more money as he perhaps feel that his son is involving in illegal activities .
[native] http://www.vancouversun.com/news/cms/binary/4516642.jpg?size=620x400s disclaimer : he 's actually from toronto , but lived in/represents alberta as a politician .
[native] > the people there jsut see it to represent the american rural southern way of life .
[non-native] when one studies politics , bussiness or military science , he 'll see that success is nearly always achieved by risks taken cunningly .
[native] the difference being the definition of `` black '' or african american was established hundreds of years ago .
[non-native] they starts to learn new things and practice it with their friends in their houses .
[non-native] fei disagree with the following statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today as following reasons .
[native] from an organisation like that , it should be really listed as a disputed territory and as such should be given a broken line boundary .
[native] i think ukip is the greatest threat to this country in several generations .
[native] the correct term is `` spacecraft operations engineers '' .
[native] if russia can paint nato as a paper tiger without teeth in the defense of the baltics , it can erode any diplomatic or military confidence that nato provides to those states .
[native] so the uk government should use smoke and mirrors to deceive the british public so they do n't form the wrong opinions ?
[non-native] teacher should point out process like these , so they could get much better results out of their teaching and could more accourately reach their goals .
[non-native] even the the right things we have been doing may not be best to do an other time .
[non-native] when you get older life became more difficult because you cant control your body easily and your movements became slower .
[native] negotiations are still under way , so there is no way to know what is in it yet .
[native] i 've been following the ukraine crisis since last winter when i would wake up every morning and turn on the live stream from the maidan .
[non-native] for example students can be taught to help elder people in old age homes as it will give happiness to them or other wise help the public park maintain cleanliness with a special cleaning drive involving all the schools in that locality .
[non-native] traveling in a group with a guide makes one explore an area extensively .
[native] i do n't see why they would want to advertise and promote * this particular brigade * .
[non-native] as you 're a child .yes , i agree with this idea .
[native] people were protesting peacefully on the streets for free elections in aleppo after assad tortured school children for writing anti-government slogans .
[native] the cold war has ended , but in someways the olympics stay very political .
[non-native] so who is better well i feel the person who is attending the class and reading one then the person who is reading many times but not understanding the fact and the ideas may be he will gain more marks in the exam comparing to other one but later the will be diffrent .
[native] funny how people will complain about russia 's evil soviet empire imposing harsh regimes upon them in one breath and then in the next talk about how it is an example of internationalism that included all ethnic peoples .
[non-native] yet , these days education is improving and there is competion between people .
[non-native] many advertisment companies promote thier products perfectly and fictionally than they really are ; therefore , i agree with this statement .
[native] and when you have a good proof , it 's because it 's proven . ''
[non-native] however , it is said that chinese and indian population will increase drastically .
[native] they prefer to take the lazy option , of having people legislate who can have access , rather than getting out there , writing letters to their mps , forming groups , and making their voices heard .
[native] i agree there are a lot of similarities in the arts and cuisine , as well as the historical ties , but the ethnicity , language and religion seems quite different to me .
[non-native] `` kids can help the children '' , thats what craig keilburger thought .
[non-native] thirdly , after getting their first jobs , they have to work day in and day out and at the same time deal with pressures of uncertainties in their future , including the possibilities that they might never be successful in their careers or could even lose their jobs .
[non-native] nowadays we have the possibility of using his ideas and to adfirm that he was and he continues to be a genious .
[non-native] so they tries to grab every opportunity which they get for making an enjoyment .
[native] is a clever repartee really enough to determine that ?
[non-native] it requires qualities , which are not the same as to try something new , and it can appear as more difficult to do well as to be an aventurer .
[non-native] soon we would have none of our natural reserves left .
[non-native] a famous statement says that the success will not come following the mass to the sea but looking for the spring .
[non-native] for all these reasons , i prefer travelling with a group , that was led by a tour guide .the question of how many cars will be in use in future times is very significant , in particular with regard to the enormous damage the use of cars cause to our environment and the shrinking oil supplies of the world .
[non-native] lastly , it is much safe to travel with a lot of people instead of travelling alone .
[non-native] even a normal financially stable familly today have two to three cars .
[native] hell he still has a rotary phone and only listens to radio so he is set .
[non-native] here are some of the reasons to support my point .
[non-native] but if they understand these ideas and concepts they will complusory be like a past people be living .
[native] are deployed and when is extremely important information for russia to develop a comprehensive defense strategy .
[native] the thought of having to work in that heat is horrible .
[native] ok , so you 've conflated the power of a dictator with the way they usually end up running their countries .
[native] also , you went off topic , the op was talking about the commonwealth , all of which are still politically linked to the uk , america cut those apron string a few hundred years ago and celebrates it every year .
[native] in my opinion the eu 's integrating efforts have long passed the peak of increasing peace .
[non-native] to sum up , the assertion that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities is wrong and in my opinion all the problems ( small ) must be looked after by the community head .this is a very interesting question because it represents the current challenge in french education .
[non-native] they always consider the most suitable way for the transportation .
[non-native] i believe that the success stories of people who do give help to their community will inspire those who shy away .fewer cars in twenty years ?
[non-native] i think most subjects are related , and they have influence on each other .
[non-native] twenty years old ther was less people and the people used other transport for moving , and the prize for buy a car is very big for the normal people .
[native] i do n't love islamists , and are n't you tired of trolling this place ?
[non-native] the problem with the catalogs was that they were written in such a way that an average person would not understand what they mean and how their cars were different from other models .
[non-native] this is nearly lying since they the company generally can not prove its product is the best , maybe the more sold but not the best .
[non-native] these organaizations tries to encouraged people to try to not contaminate a lot and to use healthy ways for not damaging the envionmet .
[non-native] it is often thought , especially in ageing societies , like in our wealthy western nations , that younger people intrinsically lack values , and for this reasons do not do enough for their communities .
[non-native] high school students have to worry and struggle for their marks in order to acquire an considerablely good education .
[non-native] so we need to be honest with our advertisement and with people .it is sad to say so , but i am afraid it would be completely the opposite .
[native] the local city has a old political saying about those running for office .
[non-native] if they do not know their past they can not know the importance of that democracy .
[non-native] i agree with the people who try to learn new things rather than they know well to do are successful people where they can acquire different fields of knowledge which had happened in my friend matter .
[native] also gnp is not a measure of `` the domestic economy '' it 's an economic statistic that includes gdp , plus any ** income earned by residents from overseas investments ** , minus income earned within the domestic economy by overseas residents .
[non-native] on the other hand , there are many products that do n't do much advertisement which are much better than products which advertise all the time .
[non-native] i experiences indian traditional house , and saved my money .
[non-native] he would neither become a perfect doctor nor a good biologist .
[native] you 'd need your parents to completely shave off your penis and scrotum to be to be the equivalent of this bullshit .
[non-native] moreover , new laws preventing the use of cars may be created .
[non-native] this would be possible when i spent enough time on it and this becomes true if i try to specialise on software engineering by not trying to know everything .
[non-native] packages and goods get delivered all over the world and one of the cheapest ways to do that still is by trucks on the road .
[non-native] the advertisements just a way to present their thoughts .
[non-native] especially , in design area , many designer have to dream their design theory and make the result , but every time , their design does not accept .
[non-native] out society members are getting more individualistic than ever .
[native] you should pay attention to what the discussion is about before responding , i 've noticed it 's a recurring issue with you .
[non-native] but if you see this problem like that , you will be obliged to work in it case by case , so in a general view a think that some person consider in many case that with only the concept or the idea the person understand well the problem without to learn the facts .
[non-native] they are going to internalise the ideas and concepts and they are going to see their reflections in their daily lives .
[native] second , it 's looking for areas where european and american standards are n't fundamentally different to make both acceptable , not to just allow us standards to override european ones .
[native] > states in the us also give up a huge amount of sovereignty in return and the federal government is allowed to freely operate within the states .
[non-native] i totally agree that a good advertisement in front of your store help your business to attract more people .
[non-native] more colours , impressive stunts , unbelievable manuevers are all aspects that make up a good commercial .
[non-native] thirdly understanding of ideas in a younger age help you a lot when you go and pursue your higher education .
[non-native] at my earlier school the standard norm was that of rote-learning .
[native] i have a feeling he might just challenge it this time .
[non-native] all these examples show that , while learning about the basics of different subjects , it is important to find out where your special talents are , to pursue them and specialize in them .i agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
[non-native] however , i think that this broad knowdledge should been given to students by high schools , and not by the university .
[native] ok , so nowhere in there does it indicate that countries have to privatize anything .
[native] i 'm not the kind of person who expects much from a server , so bearing that prejudice in mind yes , that 's been my experience .
[native] so instead of thinking `` separatists shoot down plane , probably using russian equipment '' , people think `` plane got shot down by * somebody * , i do n't know '' .
[native] i 'm from south down , so damn straight .
[non-native] finally , the environmental matter will force governments not to promote cars sellings , despite of automobile firms .
[native] catobar would have meant a much bigger investment in the carrier force we operated , the invincible class carriers were small ships and design was probably dictated by budget and politics .
[native] > do you think we will ever see cap reform ?
[non-native] let me start it by supporting myself with a saying - ' winners dont do different things , they do things differently ' .
[native] i love lebanon and hope to visit one day soon .
[native] how was the germanification of the holy roman empire any less divisive than the anglophication of the angevin empire ?
[native] you think that calling the police is enough to prosecute someone for assault ?
[non-native] actually i heard some one made that kind of cars already but it 's not that common for everybody .
[non-native] look at the youngs , they know how to relax and how to work effiently .
[non-native] an average consumer , thus , might look for alternate means to commute .
[non-native] time and money is saved as well , as people come into the workforce and do not have to get an introduction how everything works over a long period of time .

[native] we 'd never admit it , but we do love you guys .
[non-native] it might be usefull and the pace of scientific advancement might not give us a choice , but i personally believe that at the same time something is lost .
[native] yep , better get the government to make arbitrary rules then .
[native] the one about `` maultaschen '' is my favorite story .
[native] putin himself is n't signing papers for sure , he needs to retain `` plausible deniability '' if you can call it that anymore .
[non-native] because i know there is always an opportunity behind .
[native] at the title `` public citizen 's blog on globalization and trade ''
[non-native] they realy know how to sell the product , not because they studyied the product , like the shampoo i just said above , they realy know how to sell the product because they sometimes use secret messages on their advertisements .

[non-native] third , i believe that my choice is appropriate because of decision making skills .
[non-native] if those products , such as nike shoes or levi 's low rise jeans , were not on tv or magazine , i do not think they would sell like that much even though they had still same quality .
[native] sorry if it seemed like i was saying you were wrong or anything , i just wanted people to know .
[non-native] maybe they did not take about more how to use the products .
[native] harriers were not really meant to go toe to toe against modern air superiority fighters , but they dealt with the old a-4 skyhawks and mirage iii 's the argentinians used , the su-27 would have eaten a harrier alive , but the harrier was never meant to deal with it. , the tornado 's would have had responsibility for those .
[native] considering the council and parliament also play a role in the legislation process , i 'm not entirely sure what you 're getting at .

[non-native] when you open a t.v. you will see what i mean .
[native] traditionally british is not white and old fashioned , stuck in the 1700 's , traditionally british might as well be the uk 15-20 years ago because things have changed so quickly .
[native] but small towns struggling is not evidence that ireland has nothing to offer .
[native] yes , you 're right cultural context becomes totally invalid when the recipient is unfamiliar with that culture .
[native] us ca n't do it because it has more people .
[native] for example the westboro baptist church who do them horrible protests wuld be arrested here for inciting hatred .
[non-native] if a person is not specialized in any subject , and he has a broad knowledge of all the subjects , he wo n't be able to recognize the subjects of his interest , and he might end up doing a job from which he might not get enough satisfaction .

[native] he was the most tolerant king towards catholics since mary i !
[native] i am well aware of the differences and the horrors and torture experienced by girls and women who are subjected to this barbarism , however by making the distinction you enable people to make the argument `` well this mutilation is n't as bad as that one , so it 's totally ok '' .
[native] the ira ceasefire of 1997 was the big one for me ( and that 's me speaking as a nationalist in a nationalist area ) which did a lot to relieve tensions , even if their unionist counterparts were never as reliable , and the gfa and to a lesser extent the st andrew 's agreement did a lot to create a more balanced state .
[native] and you 're right , catalonia was not a municipality in the crown of aragÃ³n , [ it was a principality ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crown_of_aragon#composition ) , ruled over by the aragones crown - my mistake .
[native] the story of troy is greeks against greeks - with troy being in anatolia .
[non-native] that either run on some gas or any other burning substance .

[native] nationalism is fucking retarded and lands us in situations like we find ourselves in now .

[non-native] thus , i think that many people among the citizens have realized that they all had a major role in their planet 's health and they might indeed respect the advices of the ecologists organizations , by using their car less for example .
[non-native] thus , you wont leave heavy stones of frustration or hate for you in the last years of your life .
[native] i 'd be wary of their bias as well .
[non-native] i leann facts this subjec could easily understand now .
[native] why is n't europe doing something about us interventionism and destructive policies , but is sanctioning russia over ukraine ?
[non-native] there is less air and sound pollution , i have a car but i use it if necessary i prefer do moving with my legs to little distances .
[native] or will it just lead to more extreme measures being taken by would be immigrants ?
[native] could anyone tell me how it applies to international students ?
[non-native] i go different part of the world and do different things every day .
[native] when i posted this , the only discussion in the thread was germany vs austria , not touching any of the other major economies like france or italy .
[native] wait , please explain how net neutrality stops providers charging by the minute for access to the internet ?
[non-native] but without risk , we can not change and evoluate .
[non-native] for this reason they want to know and learn new things they enjoy alot .
[native] creating any kind of job is far better than not creating jobs .
[native] words do have specific meanings , we should n't just change them so suit our agenda .
[non-native] if you always pondered about whether to seize an opprtunity or not , it would probably be gone before you came to a decision .
[non-native] for example : jenny has to study science , the first thing she should do is read all the information , digest it and make her oun conclusions based on her knowledge .
[non-native] if glunbo did not took risk , if he gave up during the trip , maybe the new america land did not discovery until today .
[native] the real measure is the actual environmental standards in place , and their enforcement , and their effectiveness .
[non-native] finally , i would say that students should understand concepts and ideas and learn facts becouse no one knows what will happen after days , years or century becouse life is progressinf and science is devolopingwith the recent rapid economic development , the pace of life is becoming faster and faster .
[non-native] would n't it be wonderful to visit a buddhist termple alone or with your best friend or your spouse in the moonlight , to see the golden buddha gleam , and feel close to the spiritual world ?
[native] it 's a shame irish people have n't learnt .
[native] i 'm an american , and even i know that denmark is the capital of holland .
[native] that may not happen for another while ( if ever ) but in the meantime , roi should accept sterling where possible to cater for those that do n't wish to use euro .
[native] > get one or two missiles through the moscow adm system ?
[native] but you guys can throw your weight around if you want and get whatever you want .
[non-native] actually we can see that kind of cars on the road sometimes .
[non-native] otherwise , many youth find happiness in helping out their communities and they can cherish these memories for long .iam of the opinion that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
[non-native] in addition , travelling in a group led by a tour guide is safer .
[non-native] to sum up , knowing many things has several advatages .
[native] gue/ngl 's candidate , tsipras , advocated for the latter .
[non-native] any student or professor who concentrates only on single subject produces very good results .
[non-native] they want to the climents to keep their eyes on .
[native] not being funny , but if they do surely we do .
[non-native] to be able to answer those questions we need to be really very careful about the strategies we use in the advertisement .
[native] they do n't have a great reputation with the locals for things like cultural respect or friendliness , but they must bring the rubles , because again , there are signs in russian everywhere .
[non-native] this person was n't really good in school , he always got bad grades , but in his house , he was learning to facts , doing things by himself .
[non-native] first of all , my opinon about this question is that advertisements do change the point of view in terms of its quality or usage .
[non-native] i think that schools have to help students to improve their capacity to learn new concepts more efficiently and rapidly is possible and to show them more topics is possible about many areas of knowledge that they will study more deeply when there will be the specific need .it is a very hard subject to bring up individuals that are so well developed by means of academic acknowledement and will be able to discover things that may be milestones of the concerning science .
[non-native] third , most advertisments express their ideas with too much good words .
[non-native] i and my family have only one car but this means come used several times .
[native] businesses would n't have a problem because it drives down wages .
[non-native] they can continue to work longer , run faster , need shorter time to sleep , and so on than the old people do .
[native] maybe evil corps would use their evil corporate lobbying powers to label the good corps as the evil ones needing nationalization !
[native] wanting the uk to have limits on immigration from the eu is not , of itself , xenophobic ( just as it is not xenophobic for french , spaniards and italians to want there to be limits on immigration into their countries from africa or asia or america ) .
[non-native] the last but not least , some taste changes are totally related with the advertisements which make products seem much better .
[non-native] i also think that it is better to specialize in one specific subject because you will learn a lot about the subject , you will be teached everything you have to know about it , and you will know all its different characteristics .
[non-native] an individual person is nothing without communities around him .
[non-native] becasuse they are having long time so young people must thank to them .
[non-native] then , young people do benefit from an other important advantage : they have time in front of them .
[native] edit : apparently i shame my european ancestors by not appreciating art .
[non-native] another argument is that technology is in constant change .
[non-native] the cost of oil has been increased for the last ten years and it is absolutely possible that it will be the same thing in the next twenty years .
[non-native] the trip will be diffenitly more valuable if it is spent with such great accompany .in this world you can find people who have a broad knoledge of many academic subject which can do lot of very basic things and people who are specialized in one specific subject and can resolve very complex problems about a subject .
[native] this seems like an example * par excellence * of ` throwing money at the problem ' in the hope it 'll get better .
[non-native] making a good , interesting advertisment is one of the salespoint that company and the product has to concern .i strongly agree the idea that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
[non-native] we all know about this one `` experience is learns new skill '' that means when u got experience that helps to understand ideas and concepsts .
[non-native] they can certainly enjoy the sunshine and the fresh air during daytime or sit down in a bench and chat with each other .
[non-native] this is the reason why they are so successfull in growing up in a relatively short period of time .
[native] basic income would thus nearly double the amount of money available for social assistance without having to allocate more funds to it .
[native] have you lived in an area with many migrants ?
[native] also the us has n't tried to ethnically cleanse or starve out canadians or australians .
[non-native] even though one of the family members dies , young people who live next to such family will not help them or , in extreme cases , will not pay any attention to them .
[non-native] for example , pressure of there job norma , working skedules , etc .
[non-native] now facts suggest that most of the rush hour traffic is constituted of the people commuting between their offices and home .
[non-native] but since the technology continues to improve , cars will eventually give way to other wonderful inventions , just like the horses gave way to cars .
[non-native] some people are successful academically , others do well in athletics .
[non-native] while i was in college i almost spent most of my week ends doing some assignments or preparing for presentations .
[non-native] first of all , i believe that in the society of today televisions and newspapers exercise a great impact on the common understanding of the concept of beauty and effectiveness .
[native] i should learn finnic languages , they are what make your anthems sound so awesome !
[non-native] so no matter what the reason is , we have to start as soon as possible .
[native] > americans are n't more ignorant than europeans , it 's just that their ignorants are more confident than ours .
[native] i do n't hate you , you guys made the best leather wallet i have ever owned .
[non-native] for example , if you arrive to university and you choose to learn economics sciences , i think it is better to take different courses related to it than to take , for example , one italian class , one class of modern art and . ..
[native] which is exactly the same as cameron is doing .
[native] it 'll only be a matter of seeing whether they can translate that into the national level .
[non-native] i suggest my country korea to choose that way , either .`` do n't jude the book by its cover '' is a common say in english to send a singal to people that they should not be decieved by whatever they see .
[non-native] people are lavishly spending money on the materials they like to posses and belive me this is a trend which is not going to stop .
[non-native] in addition , this kind of people dares to perform whatever they have planned .
[non-native] in my opinion , i like to travel in a group led by a tour guide .
[non-native] you can have many ways to develop a solution which could respond to your problem .
[non-native] for an undergraduate student , it is recommened to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
[native] not that you made that argument , just wanted to throw that out there .
[native] sadly , if catalonia became independent tomorrow and stated in the euro , it would still face the same problems and limited options that the spanish government facing now : an overvalued currency , high unemployment and very high debt .
[native] there must be some compromise where justice can be done , and the girl can also keep her dignity .
[non-native] then , concepts and facts are necessary to each other .
[non-native] for that we need to study lot of academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . .we all hope that we want to enjoy our lives .
[non-native] finally , and that may sound paradoxical , some adverstisements seem to minimize the presented products .
[non-native] on the other hand , a specialist in finance would be able to give a solution solely in terms of bottomlines resulting in a less practical solution for the customer .
[native] ukraine used to have favour from russia like those other nations .
[native] in the uk and germany , real wages are steadily falling ( convergence ) but at least employment has remained buoyant .
[non-native] i do n't have my own car yet but i see my parents , they have their own car but they do n't go out driving with their car all the time .
[native] especially since what you were wrong about the choice being between german or uk multinationals .
[non-native] especially these people let their money work for them in order to gain more and more .
[non-native] this might be a posiibility for more distant future when fossil fuels start to show a marked decrease , but then the future might be embracing solar cars and cars driven by other non-conservative sources of energy .
[non-native] adviture is the think that is very important to enjoy your job and your life .
[non-native] that would reduce the number of cars in use for sure .i disagree with the statement which is the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
[non-native] unfortunately the most of the advertisements do not show the reality .
[non-native] in conclusion , i agree that it more is more important for student to understand ideas and concepts .
[native] anytime you make a comment , i 'll reply with the screen shot to let other people know what kind of person you are .
[non-native] first , young people have more energy than older people and they can spend this energy by making their lifes enjoyable .
[native] i feel bad because my internet is shite enough that i managed to pause before it autoplayed ... : /
[non-native] if you traveled alon and got sick there is nobody around you to help you .
[non-native] but in another way , it is not a lie and the point wich has been emphasized are true .
[native] this just tells me tsipras did not accept the vast amounts of money i am sure he has been offered by the many wealthy parties who are interested in a `` yes '' outcome .
[non-native] for example , my friend once bought a physical training machine which was advertised for its quick results .
[native] i 'd be really surprised if britain leaving the eu actually caused problems for you staying in the uk .
[native] your ridiculous island nation will complete its fade into obscurity because of morons like yourself .
[native] regardless , germany is still doing much better than the rest of europe by a pretty large margin specifically because of these policies .
[native] ja mieszkam w polsce i nauczylem sie polskiego ... edit : but i guess this just shows the face of the right-wing in poland even more - prejudge everyone , i know i 'm right ( ha ) , fuck the foreigners attitude .
[native] but people just shrug and say , `` it 's okay , they 're just looking out for their own interests '' , as if that makes it okay .
[non-native] however the arguments in favour of this statements hold more weight .
[non-native] they know that one single mistake can actually bring your whole life to a mighty crash .
[non-native] but today i realised that this is not the way it should be .
[native] actually i do n't think that many people north or south of the border would vote for a united ireland at this stage .
[non-native] they have to do diferent things every films or albums .
[native] > the breakup of the uk would give british folks an even greater say in the eu , just based on numbers considering the uk may be leaving the european parliament within the space of a few years , this is n't a major concern .
[native] i do n't have a problem with having a bias , but i do have a problem with outright lying to make a point .
[non-native] in my openion i believe that having broad knowledge is better than specializing in one specific subject .
[native] we have to consider wether it 's better to pay extra for the irish stuff just because it 's irish ( for the same quality ) or if we might be better off if we focused on something we can produce cheaper ( for the same/better quality ) .
[native] i also would n't be surprised if vietnam became their ukraine .
[non-native] fistr of all because the car is an essential method of transportation .
[native] obviously , to the extent that the european general interest and the uk interest conflict , the uk government should support the uk interest .
[native] yeah russian is so different , i guess because they are forced to learn russian people think they are they same because ukrainains speak both .
[native] assuming they can trust that they tell the truth .
[native] then they wo n't feel the need to keep breaking away .
[non-native] because of this they feel more demand to go out , discover , making new experiences .
[non-native] the prices will be cheaper , so that i can buy more things .
[native] if you want to keep these things then you need to adopt a protectionist stance or face decline in those three areas .
[non-native] learning is the easy part as there are no consiquenses .
[native] there are also cities where 30 % of the population is foreign born , if you think that causes no change in the culture of the city then i 'm not sure what would .
[native] i do understand , though it still does n't justify russian culture ... but i do understand .
[native] ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5v6na3m.jpg ) edit : a lot of attempts at removing scotland actually leave the scottish saltire in place but against a white backdrop , yielding [ this .
[native] `` just the kind of people we should be arming to the teeth . ''
[native] of course , estonia says [ their russians are not like ukrainian russians .
[native] oh the joys of belonging to a large voting group .
[native] here is a document he 's written by the same name : http://works.bepress.com/matthew_rimmer/178/ also see http://www.youtube.com/user/drmatthewrimmer
[native] well its only their community that does this stuff .
[native] i think he 's proven by now he has no answer for the economic problems his economy has been beset by , except doing what he has always done and assume it will get him out of trouble .
[native] the canadian government lost specifically because they claimed it was for health reasons , where their own health department reports explicitly stated otherwise .
[non-native] young people should be their icons , but unfortunately they are not , added to that they take up a large participation in damaging those legal communities .
[native] > `` this system imposed by the u.s. '' what a fucking joke .
[non-native] first of all , let us consider in which way taking risk could be a good strategy .
[non-native] this question is not easy to answer , because i am convinced that this question is not able to be answered generally .
[non-native] a survey conducted by a popular magzine , ` india today ' shows a inclination of the students towards community works .
[non-native] it is also stated in english literature , in the famous greek play dr. faustus .
[native] i mean , they would n't be nazis then , but if they were peaceful and condemned both the holocaust and ww2 , i suppose it would be fine .

[native] the west can do something that 's not a provocation in russia 's eyes ?
[non-native] last but not least , young people know well about how to relaxe themsevles from the pressure .
[native] foreign policy concerns are secondary , and the attempt the rationalize these irrational beliefs this way is just pointless .
[native] might surprise you to hear what 's being built in the next 5 years then : http://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-skyline-in-2020-2014-7 midtown manhattan getting a few new tall and skinnys , with one that will claim the title of tallest residential tower .
[native] news : bullets used in war come from major armament producing nations .
[native] the best example is probably the ethyl case which i wrote about [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/2kq8in/why_support_the_tpp_when_it_will_let_foreign/clnu2rl ) .
[non-native] in my opinion , we could n't and must n't continue to use and do what we already know how to do well and we have to follow the examples of our masters .marketing has evolved throughtout time and has become more complex as time pases .
[native] > and the eu is moving further towards tighter integration .
[native] it 'd be really great if people could stick to the issue of of the subsidies , instead of turning it into another `` nuclear power bad '' , `` no , nuclear power good '' argument that 's been played out to death a hundred times in this subreddit .
[non-native] concepts help the memory and the understanding of things .
[non-native] they devote enough time in coummunity service in voluntary activities , under the education policy of the government , and as inspired by school and society .successful is the dream of every body .

[native] dyngus day ( polish ) , italian or columbus day festivals , hellenic festival , etc.
[native] ugh i wish i did n't know this but ... there was this video on / r/morbidreality where this indian man was tricked by the media/film-crew that he would be extinguished after he doused himself in gasoline and set himself ablaze ... they did n't do anything - he was running around screaming in a ball of flame for a good 30 seconds before dying , so i do n't think it has anything to do with oxygen .

[native] > it would reestablish the importance of the nation-state in the political thought of the left .
[native] > people do n't vote for ukip just because of europe the eu is exactly the reason ( and the only reason ) why i vote ukip .
[non-native] first of all , cars have variety of usage areas for every kind of transportation facilities .
[non-native] also , due to the generally risng standards of people , and the car manufacturers desiging and manufacturing cheaper and more efficient cars give rise to the speculation that as more and more people are able to aford a car , they will go ahead and purchase one .
[non-native] in architecture for example , it is important to know some facts , that are milestones in the history of architecture , but what is more convincing , is not the application of facts , but the accurance of you concept when you will present your project .
[non-native] helping people is much more important than watching tv or studying .travelling is one of the most popular pastime for most people .

[non-native] the advertisements try by this method to increase consum and profits for the producing company , but very often you make unnecessary purchases and expenditures because you use the advertised products only once .

[native] and no , it would not be disenfranchising them .
[native] not fantastic news for the uk , but it takes some pressure off .
[non-native] i agree with the first opinonpeoples like to travel around the world , they wants to know the have a very good memory and able to know different culture in different country , in my country , people usually go to travel as a group which led by a tour guide , because it is much more cheaper and they wants to go with their friend or family .

[native] on what do you base the idea that quality standards will hit rock bottom ?
[native] especially canadians who prefer european products to canadian products ?
[non-native] but using my personal knowledge i can say that each risk you take is an oportunity to win , while each risk you avoid is an oportunity that goes away from you hadns .
[native] the point of nato is to be a militaristic force , so they want to have a military foothold in the region .
[non-native] for example , without the new deal of rathford , there will never be the rising of american 's economy , simply infered , there will never make american successfully become the most powerful country in the world nowaday .
[native] there was absolutely nothing disingenuous about it - you * can * be genuinely sarcastic , particularly when it 's as bloody obvious as above .
[native] additionally , it 's often good to start any discussion off which an outside benchmark comparison to frame the numbers .
[native] leaving the eu wo n't be the downfall of the uk .
[non-native] let us think about china : it has a population of more than one billion people .
[non-native] in addition to this , if you bear in mind a youth can not afford most of the times to live close to our workplaces , you have to count with the commuting times .
[non-native] for instance , in my case , the computer programmer needs special knowledges such as coding java languages , c languages and c++ language .
[native] now if russia squats long enough ( and actually starts paying the bills , considering crimea is without water and power ) then people will eventually start to regard the territory as theirs .
[non-native] unless he knows what are the factors involved in developing efficiency he can not succeed .
[non-native] no body from them asks how many one will suffring if they use this product .
[non-native] second , many developing countries in the world , for example , china , where i am from , are experiencing fasted economic growth .
[native] on this i agree entirely but anyone with half a brain can see ireland blindly follows everything that is wrong with the english system ( which i find rather embarrassing for a country that is supposed to supposed to have won a hard fought independence from the uk ) we have a copied legal system , now this `` patent box '' which uk introduced a few years back and now we have a capital city which rewards a landlord/nama/landowner class with 10 % a year on their investments while lower paid workers have their wages eroded by rant and mortgage hikes until they are either surviving on food banks or give up and are forced to move out of an area as it 's too expensive for them to live there anymore .
[native] they both need to agree to make a law .
[non-native] therefore , as long as i teach , i think i have a lot of things or subjects i need to study .
[native] anyone who actually committed a crime needs to be imprisoned , obviously .
[non-native] facts without your opinion or concepts are useless even though how important the fact is .
[non-native] moreover , the worldwide oil crisis ca n't be taken into account .
[native] victor orban seemed quite clear about his philosophy in his july 26 speech in which he says he wants to build an `` illiberal state '' , listing russia , turkey and china as examples of `` successful '' nations , `` none of which is liberal and some of which are n't even democracies . '' i mean , even the euroskeptics largely support liberal democracy ...
[non-native] we all expect a slower pace of life , of course life is not simple , but young and old people have to enjoy they life and those of them relatives .i agree with the statement that successful people try new things instead of doing what they already know how to do well .
[native] nick farage and his bunch of clowns are the temporary beneficiaries ; but idiots are idiots , over the long term they have no serious answers or ways of dealing with these huge challenges .
[non-native] and also adults are urging young people to get out of thier own lives and try to help the others who are suffering from economical or emotional problems in their community .
[non-native] all of us could not refuse to admit that the daytime indeed is the `` amusement park '' for old people .
[native] these days it just means a general kind of bigotry towards ` the other ' .
[non-native] this is again percieved to be an over the top move or a `` risk '' .
[non-native] also the shape of the dress changed because i was fat and the dress was really tiny .
[native] but when the uk does it ; the world ends .
[native] sure , they have passed the esm ( which the uk is n't a part of ) and the single supervisory mechanism ( also not including the uk ) , but there is clearly more to be done .
[non-native] the young people aim to enjoy all the joys which the life has to offer .
[native] now there seem to be a bit more , that 's all .
[non-native] so , one must only try new things and take risks if one does not already know how to do a certain thing well .
[native] not all of them are going to be actual psychopaths like in clockwork orange .
[non-native] you always get the best when you specialize in one specific subject .
[native] would n't that be appropriate considering the level of destruction and death directly caused by the us ?
[non-native] the revolution not only increased the speed of the production but also it opened a way for the variation .
[non-native] this can contribute to a considerable growth in the usage of cars .
[native] green represents the nationalists , orange represents the unionists ( orange because william of orange came here with an army to help britain crush a nationalist army and since then unionists in northern ireland have adopted the colour ) .
[native] we 'll see what the ecj says , and if they agree that it 's mixed competence then it 'll hold weight .
[non-native] it is the best idea to rely on the tour guide and have a relaxing travel .if the youth new and if the youth is an old thought which has always been used to question the issue of this essaz .
[native] also i do n't think commercial fishing is viable in such a small lake .
[native] the best result for society is for them to realise for fucked up isis is and to want to become part of society .
[non-native] it would be better for the environement .many people prefer to travel in groups led by a tour guide , and other people prefer to travel individually .
[native] head on over to r/russia , the same people post a lot .
[non-native] this can make them more responsible towards their duties .
[non-native] i study at the university and play guitar in a rock band but i have more time to helping my communities .
[non-native] as a second reason for why i believe that advertisements do not make products seem much better than they really are is that advertisers know that it is better to work upon the real-deal .
[non-native] i agree that having a knowledge on one particular subject sticks your knowledge with that particular subject only .
[native] yes i know the whole `` greek coffee '' thing is pretty farcical ( what next `` athenian delight '' ? )
[native] i am glad russia supports them against the fascists .
[non-native] in my point of view , i can thoughfully say that it is good to have only one subject to keep in concern than to deal with many areas of acadmic studies .
[non-native] thirdly , the help the community need also is an important factor i.e the type of help the community needs from the youngsters if the help is small there no need for all the young people to look after it and instead my best opinion wuould be to take the advise of some several senior wiser men of that community instaed of catching hold of young people yo get help .
[non-native] having said that it should be taken into consideration that the chance taken should not harm oneself or others .
[non-native] second , why the good companies need to cheat their companies ?
[native] the us is still bound by nato agreements so the eu is still pretty well protected .
[native] i have plenty of `` turkish '' - german friends who are third generation immigrants but born and raised in germany yet they 're still considered turkish and treated as outsiders in general german society .
[native] but i still feel like all instant coffee , even the ` good ' stuff , still has a distinctive instant coffee taste .
[non-native] the issue reads `` twenty years '' , well i 'm sure that in twenty years we 'll see the birth of a new car generation and so the old cars will get fewer and fewer .
[non-native] in our modern society , we have so much developed public traffic that we need not to transport with our cars .
[non-native] in that way you may be able to show to recruiters or partners that you can adapt yourself to a lot of different situations .
[native] migrant cultures are generally respected and celebrated , but new zealand culture comes first .
[native] do they view it as `` acceptable '' or `` unacceptable '' .
[native] got ta say , it 's a very impressive effort nonetheless .
[native] granted , it has 10 times the area of hamburg if my memory serves me right .
[native] i personally agree with the [ ontological argument ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ontological_argument ) : it seems philosophically logical to posit that more and more powerful beings , from humans to star trek 's q , exist all the way up to an omniscient god .
[native] this sentiment in my mind is ultimately a good thing .
[non-native] on the other hand , once you understand the concept and ideas , it takes longer to remember and sometimes they never forget .
[native] in a sense you 're right , but i think it 's intentional to a degree , with congress designed to be purposefully slow so as to pretty much force compromise between the two houses .
[non-native] he went deep into the idea why the came down and made him do a research that prooved their is a force of attraction towards the earth .
[native] as thatcher said , if it was n't for the shortsighted lease , they would have been given independence .
[non-native] but only doing what they already know how to do well is extremely difficult and take risk , they just feeling if that product is good .
[native] euro fanta tastes sour , and why the fuck is it yellow ?
[non-native] on the other hand , i went to china by myself .
[native] the women do n't want to move because of the men .
[native] they have awareness of what 's happening * inside * the m25 ?
[non-native] he is not part of the big crowd of specialists .
[native] the uk government is slowly weaning ni off this subvention , and more companies are willing to invest in ni now thanks to the success of the peace process .
[native] we feel for you though - new zealand , like ireland , has one of the worst brain drains in the world ( the open border with australia makes this a lot worse ) .
[native] no figures on this , but is this not to do with immigrants generally being young and not requiring much healthcare etc ?
[non-native] furthermore , general historical concepts are very useful for the students .
[non-native] in this case study a lot in our area and taking some risk teach us new things .
[native] that information is indicated separately , as part of the branding on the product separate from the generic term for the kind of product .
[non-native] and so , every one can live in a nice , loving and cooporatoinal sosiaty .
[native] but when it 's too hot i ca n't get anything done without dripping in sweat , constant thirst and feeling stupidly tired .
[native] have the prices of the things you buy gone down recently ( and i 'm especially interested in the portugese experience ) ?
[native] if ussr was internationalist they would not have had great songs about the glorious motherland or had created buffer states between itself and nato nor would it have adopted stalin 's policy of socialism in one country .
[native] from what i 've experienced , most irish people are n't even aware of its irish origins , it 's just a thing that we celebrate along with a bunch of other countries .
[non-native] in my opinion , perhaps in the early days of advertisement the public was more naive and advertisers themselves considered that the effect of advertisement was much more powerful that it really is .
[native] > haploshit did you mean to post this in / r/european ?
[non-native] form my point of view , i find i agree with this statement for two reasons .
[native] you do know that ireland is a separate country from the uk , which is the united kingdom of great britain and ** northern ** ireland , yeah ?
[native] all i 'm saying is that even in america where that flag has far more controversy and history behind it ( and people that hate it too ) than europe this guy still would n't be considered a racist simply for hanging that flag .
[non-native] on the other hand , somebody thinks that the end of petroil will decrese the number of car , but for my it is not true , for to topic : the oil is still too much to finish suddenly and the cars ' factory never will allwe the the car wil lose importance in our life .
[non-native] in conslusion , i think it is the neccessaty to understand of both , facts and ideas to berecently , there is a heat debate on whether there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years .
[native] they might be the wave of the future , but at the moment that 's basically theoretical .
[non-native] for this to be done , an individual has to learn the facts supporting the ideas .
[native] giving different rights to different communities like navarra/basque country is absurd .
[native] what 's so ironic about my comment and me being an american ?
[non-native] because they do not have any concrete reason to glue life , they do not enjoy life more than older people .
[native] i 'm not mocking the ` need ' part , mind you , it 's a fair question .
[native] the public will is n't there to intervene if it was directly against russia .
[non-native] that is , knowing what the major part of persons will think looking a good in a particular light or a particular color can be obtain his goal .
[non-native] however , i do not think so becouse my grandmother is always enjoy her life , for example , she learnes song , it called shigin in japan , and tradidional japanese dance .
[non-native] and do n't forget the development of alternative vehicles .
[native] firstly , we only got the rebate to begin with because half the eu budget it spent on a ludicrous policy to help our continental farmers that we did n't get much of .
[non-native] in the early 21st century , it is now widely accepted that a nuclear family has more than one car , sometimes even all members have their own car : another inclination which hardens a worldwide decrease in the number of cars .
[native] i do n't think it was taken up ( obviously ireland does n't want to be in the position of being massively indebted to britain ) but the mere offer alters the playing field .
[native] it is depriving other people of the use of something , often backed by force .
[native] russia will never even want to join the eu due to this .
[native] > nationalism is awful ftfy partition is also pretty awful in its dividing of people .
[native] edit 2 - dont ask people to stop being sarcastic and then cry when they tell you how they really feel about you
[non-native] i believe in this because of my last and still coming on the surface doubts about `` what i will be in the future '' .
[native] i 've no reason to believe that it was was n't
[non-native] now i am having that test to be accepted for a job .
[non-native] for instance , a people with a wider range of knowledge will have a strong ability to analyse the problems which bother them in everyday life if they have the concept of critical reasoning .
[native] i 'm not going to read through long pdfs of shit when i do n't trust you as it is .
[native] but we do n't know yet , so we 'll have to wait and see until a negotiated document is finished .
[native] well power is just the anglicised version of the name .
[native] to say it boils down to simply differentiating members of society as being of a different race is simply ignorant of american history .
[native] the fields of athenry was sung several times , and james connolly himself showed up and destroyed jobbridge .
[native] why would a company not want their customers to be served in whichever language they feel comfortable in ?

[native] you can cherry pick shit i said all you want , but i honestly do n't think i was even attempting to say ( or actually say ) even a quarter of what you accuse me of saying .
[native] the point of fan banners is to support your team and not to insult the opponent .
[native] the daily mail has managed to make it anti-eu .
[non-native] in conclussion , it is very essential to try new things and take risks because the way of success pass through here .
[native] we are family friends with some here , and it 's horrible what they face back in egypt .
[non-native] i think that there are a lot of successful people with different opinions about the business they do .
[native] we do n't need to go on and on about it because it 's so obvious to us that we 're better than all those silly nations that are so nationalistic and petty .
[native] when people talk about london being a financial centre , they 're talking about the city of london .
[non-native] they companies are mainly found in the market and they are meduim run companies .
[non-native] they will use everything to urge you to buy their products .
[native] everybody in japan seems to be bound to societal expectations though , so this is n't something that comes up only in gender .
[native] so now we have situation where if we deescalate , parts of ukraine are radioactive wastelands , and if we escalate to icbms , large chunks of the globe are radioactive wastelands .
[non-native] this doesnt mean that the ideas and the concepts are not important , thay are very important because with them is that we can take in account the facts , so undestanding ideas and concepts are very , very important , to have a clear thought of what we have .
[non-native] therefore , it makes the products seem better than it actually is .
[native] ( it 's banned to be played in germany except for educational purposes . )
[non-native] so everyone should compete very hard to obtain higher standards .
[non-native] in addition , there are many news that young people kill themselves or kill other people .
[native] i 'm not saying you 're wrong , but it 's definitely an interesting comparison to make .
[native] i 'm a british catholic ( though , unsurprisingly , with irish grandparents ... ) .
[non-native] let these young people to know more their society .
[native] both sides have bad people , and russia supports the rebels who are just as bad .
[non-native] a successful person always enjoys the pains for trying out new things or venturing into new topics .
[native] ah , the french . . * ah , the french ... *
[native] it 's just such a stark contrast to north america , where we 're too awkward about it or people think you 're gay .
[native] > plus ireland has famously been considered in many plans as the back-door to a british invasion .
[native] that 's something some of us are very familiar with !
[non-native] at first , i was so scared to go to a totally strange place .
[native] the euro periphery , it adds , is where this perverse loop of debt and growth is severe .
[native] whenever i hear people talking about roma or young arabs doing something illegal there are always quite a few racist people that say something racist .
[non-native] in general keeping academic time aside , interest of person matters a lot .
[non-native] children are start with kindergarden then elementar school after that highschool and university , after they graduate they are doind their masters and if they are lucky , they find a job and start to work .
[native] the vast majority of eu residents do n't make daily trips into a neighbouring country though .
[native] i want to die thinking that whoever , or whatever i 've touched in my life has generally improved because of me .
[native] but it is irresponsible to make judgements or laws/policies based on statistics alone .
[native] and yea i know my own country is bad when a state only 20 years out of the soviet system can do better than it .
[non-native] i agree for a large part with this statement .
[native] most of the canadians you will meet in florida live there for 6 + months of the year , so it would make sense that they would become more accustom to things in the usa and would adapt to the local people and become almost indistinguishable .
[native] america is still war-weary over bush , and europeans could n't be provoked into action even over the destruction of mh-17 .
[non-native] for example , in japan it will have the chance to increase many cars due to traffic circumstances .
[non-native] as the student is interested in mathematics he can make it easy but he may not develop more in that as he should concentrate more on other tough subjects .
[native] as you can see we are way to far apart on this issue and neither of us will change the others mind .
[non-native] therefore , if producers make a advertisement which shows every facet of the products , including the bad ones , people are not going to buy the products since they mostly see the demerit they will have on them rather than the good effects .
[non-native] for generalists the field of practice becomes smaller and smaller while more and more subjects are taken and spaces been filled with specialists .
[native] they 've underpaid the eu by $ 33.09 per person .
[native] storage is extremely far away from any kind of practical and economic large scale use , grid upgrades would certainly help , and would allow for greater penetration of renewable energies ( something i think we 'd both agree is a good thing ) but do n't change the fundamental problems with intermittent energy sources .
[non-native] it is because of their need to have more success and also need to be more proud of them .
[native] the trans pacific partnership is an attempt to create a legal framework to make it possible for corporations to sue governments if they offer domestic support that may disadvantage international competitors .
[native] not all states separate powers in the same fashion , and certainally not as ridged as germany - which has a constitiution for each state .
[non-native] we cant simply rely on subject by knowing but for undrstanding it .
[native] to appease putin would be setting a precedent of justified invasions & annexations in europe , of * de facto * allowing russia to annex countries which consider eu membership to shore up their eurasian union .
[non-native] helping in communities is very important four young people because it makes them more reponsible .
[non-native] but also is important that they learn facts , the way these facts are produced and the best way to solve them .success is often measured by the amount of money one has or the number of propeties one owns or the number of cars one has .
[native] i only brought it up because it was relevant .
[native] did you know that ttip must be seen with tisa , the two go together ?
[non-native] seconed way of satisfaction , that what i observed that people who are doing what they love are succeccfull .
[native] because there has been `` dialogue '' over this issue .
[native] it was said that your turkish workers would only be there temporarily decades ago .
[native] unfortunately , these are the opposite of what ukraine wants to do .
[native] i am not assuming shit and i certainly do n't attempt to speak on behalf of entire communities .
[native] somebody claiming to be a master of genocide is hardly somebody worthy of our attention .
[native] * ** carryout/takeout ** most people wo n't notice if you do n't tip unless you 're a regular , but 10 % is a good rule of thumb .
[non-native] in my opinion both , understanding ideas and concepts and studying facts , are important .
[native] as for subsidising national companies : it 's their country , and their currency , so what right does the eu ( or any other country ) have to tell them how to run their country ?
[non-native] the high-brid cars use only a little amount of gasoline compared to the cars from other car companies .
[native] so either you are being daft on purpose or you 're an idiot .
[non-native] the heavy traffic is another problem of the modern man created by a lot of cars .
[non-native] practical understanding of subject is best preferred than simply knowing it , this the reason why the nowadays the education orl study is based on fieled work rather on simply class room teaching .
[native] here is the recent testimony ( video ) go to the second page of results for seoul , and watch the video with an myong chul , its the first witness , starting at around 17:30 in the video .
[non-native] i would say that essentially both are relevant : a worker with a very broad knowledge of many different subjects will find several opportunities in many companies , but his/her limited specific knowledge on a particular matter may result in being overcome by more skilled colleagues .
[non-native] it now seems quite obvious that a nice layout with attractive colours or speaches will definetly give a better feeling about the product than it should normaly be .
[native] regardless , obama does n't want to get directly involved in the battle to unseat assad .
[native] i mean you put the usa at the centre of the map cutting other nations in half which is hilarious .
[non-native] up to the second part the enviroment is so significant and if ever there are well opportunities to develop your skills it could be used so efficiently and this should be considered good luck since there are no equivalent chances everywhere .
[non-native] firstly , because i do not think that anyone could pretend order travel either alone or in a group .
[non-native] for instance some advertisements would repeat an incredibly large number of times the same moto , which generally says `` this product is the best '' or `` you ca n't be happy without this product '' .
[non-native] the successful people should not take the risks because they have to lost so much when they are not success in that event .
[native] your former colony across the atlantic has you beat i 'm afraid .
[non-native] this is enough for them to enjoy the life .
[non-native] so both young and old people have a chance to enjoy football .
[native] everyone here has given a fairly balanced view except the english .
[non-native] today cars have become a necessity of not only a rich person but also for the one who is just earning a hand full of money .
[non-native] if we have tour assistants , what to do for solving a problem is calling and asking them to help ourselves .
[native] they do n't care because they know they can get away with this .
[native] i do n't really understand what you see as `` my claims '' because i am just recounting the situation to you as i see it , and i am not in any way alone on this .
[non-native] even if you look at the students of business administration , you would see that they will choose either one specialization or dual specialization , but not more .
[non-native] generaly it is not that much easy for any one to concentrate on all the other subjects and acquire broad knowledge about them .
[native] if you get shot in america , you 'll be just as well taken care of as in your average european country .
[non-native] my personal experience in the field of engineering has led me to similar conclusions .
[non-native] it is impossilbe to use the station forever even if they are healthy .
[native] the democratic deficit is sensasionalised more than it actually is .
[native] give me your solution , if you have one .
[native] we get all the major cuisine types in the big cities here , with an emphasis on asia ( thai , vietnamese , burmese , chinese , japanese ) since bar fellow anglos , these are the bulk of our immigrants .
[non-native] being cheater , that cause the company to lose its customers that it made the advertisment for them .
[native] it 's not part of any systems of cooperation , so no real pressure is possible outside naked force .
[native] besides that , both the north and the republic have their own unique set of issues and i do n't think either side is keen on adopting the others .
[non-native] so , i want to prepare to die and i want to pass quiet until i die .
[native] of course that is not how the people with bad debt view it , instead claiming that if you support them by buying their bad debt and through government guarantees that they will then fund new growth with their new money .
[non-native] as far as i am concerned , i am convinced that some people should try this strategy because of their nature .
[native] it 's clearly a blurred line but there 's a * shit tonne * more that should be done to * un * blur it and every time someone plays dumb about the problem with the democratic deficit in the eu is just another time someone idealistically defends a very flawed institution .
[native] none of the nato countries particularly care about the fate of ukraine , though .
[native] man , i 've seen how germans behave when i was in central europe , my question is do they actually behave well when they go to places like france and england , or are they brats there too ?
[non-native] to make much memories with close friends or family , the best way to travel is to plan by themselves and take their enough time to look around .
[native] i know , it 's just a design i 've seen a couple times .
[native] i know my dad 's family , who came from italy , could get theirs back after living there for some time .
[native] if beyond the boarder plan is so important why is it that 3 years later it still has not been implemented fully ?
[non-native] the combination of particular words can create double meanings that influence the people that watch the advertisement !
[native] maybe he 's trolling and maybe he 's just ignorant ( and there is nothing wrong with a * little * ignorance )
[native] russia sees itself as a competitor to the united states as a superpower .
[native] [ not everyone sees ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/string_of_pearls_%28china%29 ) china as being quite so passive as you suggest
[non-native] however , they would be able to guess what ideas and concepts are by lerning facts .
[non-native] so from point of veiw , if we want to encourage the young people to do more in our communities , we need to take more effort on our education .
[non-native] one of my friends go to the old men 's home and cooks lunch and dinner for them everyday and read the books and newspaper for them if she has free time .
[native] non-political corruption is somewhat of a problem ; some industries have problems with organized crime infiltration , for example , although organized crime is not as intrusive or violent as in places like italy .
[native] you just got a bunch of educated people for nothing and italy got rid of insanely high levels of competition driving down wages for educated people .
[non-native] if a person is not a specialist in a particular subject , he may not be in a position to explore and invent new things in any subject , as the saying goes `` jack of all trades but master of none '' .
[native] ubiquitous anti-pervert / stop sexual harassment ads on trains do seem quite paranoid though - with a really low sex crime rate , japan probably seems the opposite based on how many psas are devoted to how bad it is .
[non-native] therefore , i feel that there will not be a decline in the use of cars because ; by losing the car you will lose many traditions , and traditions are a part of culture .
[non-native] becuse it can let them thinking what it is , and what we will do .
[non-native] therefore , it is probably that an innovative invention of the transpotation would occured .
[non-native] thus , those people who are in the business of making advertisements use different types of methods to convince their customers , one is obviously to display their products in a much better way than they are ,
[native] same reason chinese military doctrine is now focusing on power projection directed towards limited , short & decisive wars , because they too ca n't hope to compete with america & it 's allies conventionally in the pacific .
[native] next we 'll hear about investors withdrawing and hoarding physical cash ...
[native] you 're making the assumption that they can not be changed , and can not be shown how destructive their ideas are .
[native] i mean , after crimea 's annexation , chinese state media actually ran an editorial on `` how we should learn from russia to expand power without inciting retaliation from the west '' , with things such as `` russia has cleverly exploited the fact that people of russian ancestry identify more with russia than their home country '' ( same with many chinese emigrants ) , `` instead of directly imposing a military government , russia used the genius ruse of hijacking local support and installing a puppet using an apparent referendum , causing western leaders who instinctively support self-determination and democracy to think twice '' .
[non-native] it is not only that they do take risks what leads them to success , but it also the commitment and the sacrifices they make along the way to success .
[non-native] as a result , they would not take any risks in the life .
[non-native] another point i would like to mention is the definition of `` enjoy '' or perhaps `` joy '' .
[non-native] one of the most important reason of advertisement is to create brand reconition .
[native] you do n't understand the conflict because you have made no effort to understand what exactly motivates israelis -- that is , * what they are afraid of * .
[native] i always chuckle when i read secessionist recounts of the spanish war of succession , as if it were all about ` spanish troops ' killing catalans .
[non-native] as you can see the society and people has been cahnged .
[native] there is actually a very good reason why many eu countries would want their gdp to look bigger than it actually is .
[non-native] each person is individually different and general views might fit for many but not for every single human being .
[non-native] as a bar owner , i would rather prefer to lose some boring , old customers to serve open-minded new customers instaed , just because it is more exciting .
[non-native] it is a big part of its improvement and development .
[non-native] although old people might be able to get pension for sending money , they are too old to go out and do some activities in community .
[non-native] this will not only make a person more knowlegeable and wiser , but also make the person 's life happier and more colorful .
[native] but not under the kind it was being used for .
[native] according to cameron they agreed to pay money if certain conditions arose but when those conditions arose they baulked at doing so .
[native] why shouldnt the uk seek `` common ground '' on issues it has a problem with ?
[native] i actually lived and worked in opole , polska for six months so my pronunciation is better than most foreigners :)
[native] homemad cannabis tends to get sold to end users through organized crime too .
[non-native] da vinci was an artist , a doctor and an inventor to name just a few of the fields he was working in .
[non-native] to sum up , successful people have the combination of these three personal qualities .
[non-native] why i 'm saying that because im currently at the local school which i 've never had expericed of it , because i was studying in japanese school or international school in the past .
[native] the fuck do you even do with that many churches ?
[native] noun : sovereign ; plural noun : sovereigns 1 . a supreme ruler , especially a monarch .
[native] maybe in china or something , but i would n't expect that for germany .
[native] but you asked about internal disputes so i wont get into that :)
[non-native] in order to manage and controll these processes it more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn no more than facts .
[non-native] so for every succesful mission to take place a risk has to be involved .
[native] instead i 've worked 2 months of the last 18 , those 2 months in a high stress high tech environment for less than i could earn at a supermarket .
[non-native] your studies because you might descover a lot of new things during
[native] actually , a very large amount of the sensitivity ( and hence sexual pleasure ) is done away with after circumcision .
[non-native] anything can be done , i think too many vehicles are on the roads .
[native] i 'm going to comment before reading the article , something i rarely do : this is what putin wants .
[non-native] for instance , one company , `` ie singapore '' , organises a competiton in which they provide 1000 dollars initial fund to each participating group .
[native] this was it : http://www.amazon.com/timesless-nation-literature-folklore-hungarian/dp/0959687335 where abouts are you ?
[native] it 's been steadily eroded since the civil war .
[non-native] but older people do not get much holidays to enjoy , if they for a leave they get only few day i.e hardly one week .
[native] also constantly threatening their neighbours and infringing on their territory .
[native] more specifically i blame * you , the reader !
[non-native] i agree that it is important to know about a variety of things .
[native] why britain was allowed to keep `` own '' currency and for what reason ?
[non-native] what am i going to gain out of this ?
[non-native] facts are for sure important because they can explain things .
[non-native] though the young people are getting more conscious about their enviornment and people around them , they consider the problems associated with the community and the enviornment less important than their own problems .
[non-native] it is very rude and disrepectful to think `` oh . ..
[non-native] the people succesful is the people that believe in his own , and this peopla have a lot of goals in his head , and do anything for obtains all the things propouses .
[native] > britain more or less offered ireland a sizeable low rate loan immediately .
[non-native] well , life is all about trying new things and improving in various fields .
[non-native] second , even thogh understanding ideas and concepts is important , things do not always happen by follownig ideas and concepts .
[native] but the event that triggered the proceedings is the arbitrary shutdown of a number of nuclear power plants in germany owned and operated by the swedish company vattenfall , and of the accelerated shut down of others .
[native] it 's unfortunate that this is the internet , and the most i can do is shout at you .
[native] its against the law to pay someone the average wage of poland .
[non-native] on the other hand , cars are so important for the world wide economy .
[non-native] but leaving a reliable option to trying new things is not very safe and is not a garaunteed formula for success .
[non-native] in the advertisements , the toys appear so real and much better than they actually are .
[native] the government still put in a piece of legislation which banned the additive , and so the case went to arbitration through nafta .
[native] i know that post ww1 like syria you were administered by france , and so the educated and tertiary system are still largely francophone .
[native] i know people think the relationship is great , but the reality is , if you look at it as a whole , it has been in decline .
[non-native] like for kitchen designing they prefer going to kitchen specialist , for landscape designing they would go to landscape specialist , for furniture designing they will hire furniture designer .
[native] this is correlative , and not necessarily causative , but there sure as hell were n't massive job losses .
[non-native] people should enjoy every moment in their lives , because every moment brings you different satisfactions and all of them are equally pleasant .
[non-native] as a result , we spend more time gathering people and waiting for lost persons than actually travelling and seeing the country .
[native] me : this article is fake , it comes from a tabloid with no sources you : look at all these other tabloids that link to the same place , you must be stupid for not accepting the obvious fact that this is real me : may god have mercy on us all .
[non-native] one that not use to go to class and try to study all the book during the week before .
[native] i 'm supportive of having nuclear power as part of our energy mix , but are n't french rivers being overheated from nuclear power plants ?
[native] i 'd be interested in hearing someone with legal experience examine the event .
[non-native] thanks to this system , it enables you to get to know various subjects and to be able , later on , to choose in what realm of study you want to pursue your studies .
[non-native] if one with fundamentals can learn new facts in the subject using those fundamentals .
[native] i somewhat agree , but i personally do n't think that tactical nukes would likely escalate to strategic nuclear warfare .

[non-native] advertisement is a source used to make people familiar with a product .
[native] i have this radical notion that governments should have a rationale for laws .
[native] unless you say `` it 's bloody raining foreigners ! ''
[native] except they 're not illegal if they 're deemed refugees .
[non-native] it was found that those students who took several subjects outside their specialized area they do better in their final exams .
[native] they could start using their own currency , but who ( other than the domestic market ) would use it ?

[non-native] the personal mobility is something people want to have .
[non-native] one person also can only play one instrument at a time .
[native] if the uk did leave , how much harder would it be for uk citizens to live elsewhere in europe ?
[non-native] it all goes back to the consumer , not every thing u see in the advertisements could exactly be the same as u see .
[non-native] especially in countries where customers have the right to complain for the low quality of product .
[native] i can not see any reason why the woman could n't approach the bench , lift her burqa , have her identity confirmed , and then replace the veil .
[non-native] the best thing i can imagine is a world in which nearly all places are connected by a train network .
[native] while that is most definitely true , the show was broadcasted through channel 4 , so you guys definitely deserve some credit .
[non-native] people learn lot of things and get a lot of experiment during their life .
[native] it 's charming and lovely when i go to spain .
[non-native] i can say this to my fellow and my younger frineds , that if you guys have wide range of subject then i will encourage you to take it as much as it can , this will surely give you positive way of your style .
[native] but if you view social democracy as the centre and democratic socialist as the midway between trotskyists etc.
[native] however , goo was told to seek other baths houses since there are no legal basis for prosecuting ethnic discrimination in south korean law .

[non-native] for instance , laundry powder that would clear stains of all kinds totally and quickly , whereas the type from another manufacturer will not do the same good job .
[non-native] this is faciliated by the whole atmospehere of the school students , the reason lies in the system of selecting students on the basis of egagement of social activity or voluntary work .
[non-native] but recent problems like polution make the point that the worl would have to reduce the number of cars .
[non-native] before that cars become usual , they have to provide a good network of public transport not for population to see too much interest in having a personnal car .
[native] i hope things for the coptic community are safe in france with the growing radicalization that has been taking place there .

[non-native] these products were developed by engineers by understanding proper background information of it and its working principle , to get all these things done we need to understand the concepts and ideas of it .
[native] > coffee was brewed `` turkish style '' , which means that boiling water was poured onto the coarsely-ground coffee , and this custom is still practised here and there .
[non-native] a way to solve this issue could be to encourage people to contribute something for their community and make life better for everyone .i totally agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
[non-native] so , i think , that in the near future , many people might sell their cars and may travel by metro which is built in many countries such as india , u.k. , u.s.a. , and is being built in many other places too .
[native] maybe you 're right though , maybe germany may realize that draining the rest of the eurozone & weakening the south 's recovery is a double-edged sword , and actual reform will be implemented .
[native] > grammar communist do you mean grammar capitalist , tovarishch ?

[native] when people outside italy think of italy they think of the mafia .
[non-native] finally i conclude that helping his own community is the most essential function of young people .
[non-native] they just enjoy the progress they made through the discovering the new things .
[non-native] for example , one of my friend who moved us to pursue his higher studies .
[non-native] this phenomenon , which i would call ` the myth of old times ' , is based on the common perception that younger generations are much more egoist and greedy than older ones .
[native] the great ( and terrible ) thing about the us is that if you get fired or retaliated against because your employer does n't want to pay you the mandated wages , you can take their ass to court and sue for damages and wrongful termination .
[native] denmark _ links _ 12 listeria deaths to pork sausage

[native] not all plans were found for all the buildings in the old town and some facades were remade after 18th century paintings , and pictures from the 1930s .
[non-native] because the car had no car navigation systems , which showed the map where we were automatically , ken and i had a trouble to find the road we should go .

[non-native] first let me state that generally all the subjects are vast , and studying these vast subject in which a person is not interested may lead to improper knowledge about the subject .
[native] i know , it does seem like we take a long time to say goodbye !
[non-native] specializtion in one particular subject that helps you build your career will not only bring interest during the study but will also give you the satisfaction when working through it .
[non-native] first , the comprehension of something begins in observing facts .
[non-native] as an illustration , reg is 75 years old and he goes to the florida every year to watch some sport that he enjoys .
[non-native] when people get specialized in one specific subject , they might even win a nobel prize in their area of study but there is the risk that they lack important knowledge which are necessary to enjoy everyday social life .
[native] ugh , ethnicity , a term so subjective it 's lost almost all meaning except to those that live their lives by it .

[native] even then , there was no legitimate vote that said crimea should leave .
[non-native] the more reasons in support to the issue are , we will digest the concepts which are happening in our regular life once we ca n't digest those concepts we have to face more difficulties .
[non-native] for instance , there was a bomb blast in the train and many people made an idea that most of them have injured and fewer have lost their lives but the fact was vice-versa most of them had lost their life , so there was wrong information shown in the television .

[native] if that was really your intent , perhaps go about it in a different manner next time .
[native] this need be no disaster : if the government 's balance sheet is more robust than those of much of the private sector , it ought to take the strain .

[native] i originally assumed differently , but i 've found that in madrid , andalusia and ( perhaps more predictably ) zaragoza so many people have cousins or other relatives in barcelona who speak catalan etc.
[non-native] in conclusion , being specialized in one specific subject is good but it is not enough .
[native] they will ask about the other person 's daily routine , where they met , ask for pictures from vacations , etc.
[native] i mean the languages are n't really mutually intelligible unlike turkish and azeri , because they evolved and originated from very different language groups .
[native] if it does collapse ff and fg would put there shit on pause for a few years and form a coalition before the let sf into power .
[non-native] in conclusion with the avilablity of the entertainments any time at any place , movies which increases every day and the attitude of the person himself , the time for helping the community becomes rare .
[native] they recently updated a lot of meters to offer 20 % as the minimum , this is bullshit .
[non-native] and also , the guide can tell us some interesting local customs which enjoy us .
[native] no , but i think there 's a very important distinction between democracy and governance that many people seem to ignore .
[native] canada has 1.2 million ukrainian-canadians and our government publicly supports the ukraine which has led to a russian ban on canadian food , the largest being the pork market worth half a billion dollars .
[non-native] in the long run , the whole society seems to adapt this phenomena .
[native] before the british mandate of palestine it was part of the ottoman empire , which was 80 % muslim , 15 % christian and 5 % muslim .
[non-native] these political parties/organisations require the youth to effectively raise there voice and the youth inturns gets involved in it so as to make a mark for themselves .
[native] regardless , even ` murica would feel uncomfortable about the size and influence of corporations .
[native] i think we should be supplying the ukranians with as much aid , both military & civil , as we can .

[non-native] in older days people where having less mental burden as compared to know .
[native] we ca n't even begin to comprehend their problems , let alone the calculus that solves their problems .
[native] i would n't call them opportunist though in that regard .
[native] i dont know a `` blue '' version of `` better dead than red '' , but you get the picture .
[non-native] as a conclusion , i agree with the factsuccessful people are the people , who have risen in their work and social life .
[native] > ireland 's growth is because of ireland 's long term policies , not the policies of its current government .
[native] germany has large state owned banks and corporatist labour and economic structure , and china is simmilar ( except more corporations are state owned ) .
[non-native] i had got the same problem also in my mos , because all the subjects that we have to sustain in order to take ours master degree provide only for a teoric preparation based on concepts , ideas but there is a great gap related to the understanding of the facts .
[native] i 've never heard that allegory , quiet enjoyed that
[native] - the us supreme court rules on the constitutionality of gay marriage , despite having no explicit reference for or against what is essentially a legal contract between two individuals .
[native] it has been politically very easy to implement austerity in ireland compared to elsewhere in the eurozone .
[native] that 's not how that word works : you can be at fault when you get stuck

[native] i think that 's actually a skateboard ... which raises more questions
[native] like all countries , a large proportion of our electorate are complete fucking morons and i 'm upset to say that i 'd wager the problem is likely more present here than it is in nordic countries , and switzerland .
[non-native] but the young person have more than sometimes the necessary strenght to go on , indipendently by wrong schemes , to track his ideal of life , that are really good ideal of life .
[non-native] people who are successful in thier previous inventions get more motivated in doing the new inventions , tats himself proves his ability to do and thinks himself to satnd in a high position when compared to others .
[native] i suppose english is the exception in nordic countries , but most european countries are really monolingual .
[native] regardless , isds is nowhere near as bad as commonly reported .

[native] much better if berlisconi brings down his own government , then italians have nobody but themselves to blame .

[native] > why would you vote for conservative if you want the uk to leave the eu ?
[non-native] in the learning i am saying ` academic subjects'student are teach how to think but not what to think .
[native] freedom of movement just speeds up the effects of cheaper labour on the cost of production .
[native] canadian english , some french and some russian ( just learning ) .
[native] the americans got greedy and tried to take them .
[native] nukes are pretty much an all or nothing thing .
[native] i know that the civil war did incredible damage to your country and that even now it 's a fragile peace .
[non-native] let 's imagine an hipotetic world in which people do not love cars : the henry ford 's idea would probably not have been successful .
[non-native] it will be the first thing a manager will notice when you will present him your resume , when you apply for your first job .
[native] check out the material he did with gorgoroth , also .
[non-native] finially , communities was the person who live there , not only young people should care .
[native] it 's fairly in contrast to lenin 's ideas of what a proletarian dictatorship would look like , that is , an authoritarian state intended to enforce the ideas of the revolution and prevent counter-revolution .
[non-native] that 's why it can be said that succesful people try new things and take risks .
[native] if you want to compare things that happened hundreds of years ago with modern day values then everyone and everything was evil or unjust .
[native] if you miss a step , the frog will jump out of the water .
[native] the house does n't get to vote on it , but if the implementation of the treaty requires the expenditure of funds , the house can block , or at least impede , it 's implementation by refusing to vote for the appropriation of the necessary funds * ( which ties into my earlier point about only the house being able to propose spending bills ) * .
[non-native] and a lot of studies show that most of the people are easily to impress , especially with pictures or videos .
[non-native] they do not forget their children but they do not see the importance of their children and that they need love and other things like that .

[native] for all those that come to work in the nhs and european healthcare systems , they will all eventually be straining the social services they 've been hired to work in when they 're elderly .

[non-native] espesially when you get on the bus to go some place they take the microphone and they never stop talking .

[non-native] and that 's sure a good hint on how the future may look like .
[non-native] there are more than 6 billion people on earth and people are becoming more and more educated .
[non-native] secondly , many academic subjects gain us to think more widely .
[non-native] as a matter of fact , what consumers pay for what they buy going to the advertising because companies want to cousmers to buy their products .
[native] we 're just seeing the very first slivers of those ramifications .
[non-native] for example , a marketing director is specialized in one subject which is marketing because it is his function in the company .
[non-native] in conclusion , i think that in order to be a skilled and successful worker , a person should have a broad knowledge basis on many different academic subjects , and a specialization in the particular field where he/she is interested in working in .the question askes to discuss the usage and the effect of advertisements on products .
[native] i agree though , a default by greece would mean entering uncharted waters never sailed during iceland 's experience with default and subsequent recovery .
[non-native] aquiring knowledge about new fields is always good but not at the cost of one 's own field of specialization .
[native] but many other english-speaking countries would then invest in ireland , aside from the financial industry .
[non-native] futher , i am sure there will be better way to work with a person in distant later .

[native] in northern ireland , they 're in power with the dup and so they 've had to compromise a great deal , but if they get into power in the republic it may be a different story .

[native] i hope canada never joins into a union with the usa .
[non-native] also , they distract the person from foucesing on his own major subject which he uses in his future job and let him spend his time on subjects that he do not need in his job .

[native] you need only look to the american situation to see why that is n't exactly desirable .
[native] i bet xenophobes take this and try to say germany is being invaded .
[non-native] that thing happened to me , when i was going to buy a cell phone , which has a sticker on it says free .
[native] it 's amazing the reaction from some brits , they swear that this is a merkel diktat and some sort of conspiracy against them , like the eu should just go with whatever they want .
[native] > you could make the argument that we had an easier decision to make because the irish really are n't in a bad shape overall .
[native] it 's very straight forward and spells everything out .
[native] > i think you 're vastly overestimating how much the eu cares about the uk and if stays or not .
[non-native] first , technology advances cut the unity between people .
[non-native] another type is a company that wants to sell the product a couple of times and build the company on the support they will offer with the product , and these companies need to have nice advertising a little bit , than reality so the consumer can buy from the first pass .
[native] > the basqe country is in spain tell that to lower navarre , labourd , and soule !
[native] an independent scotland is worse for us interests , as both the uk and scotland will be a less powerful ally .
[non-native] by studying the other subject we have a chance to undrestand what the subject we really like , and we get more informations and experiences for both our social and the professional life .there are studenst in the world .
[native] because it does n't suit them to , the popular narrative in the uk is that immigrants come over here to steal our jobs and benefits so the parties play along because it 's easier to support that narrative than to educate the population .
[native] you do n't take more money from poorly performing countries than better performing ones .

[native] whether eu immigration laws will allow us to go on letting in the british to work in those companies i do n't know - we 'll probably have to join schengen , so probably not .
[native] i enjoy it , i 've learnt german and lived there for a year .

[non-native] succesful people use the things which are already known in order to reach their goals .
[non-native] first of all , the public is n't as naive as some people might consider .
[non-native] on the other hand , it 's obvious that the seller 's purpose from this advertisement is to persuade people and encourage them to purchase the product .
[native] out of curiosity , what persuaded you to reply in a ten day old submission ?
[native] maybe the fsb was going after his contact and snagged this guy as well .

[non-native] our company stayed around 60 employees and grew at a 2-3 % growth rate for the 1st 35 years of existence .
[native] my complaint is n't against job creation or economic success - i 'm in favour of both - it 's of the attempts to limit that success to a small group of people based on their ethnicity or place of birth .
[native] modern nations work by investing money into regions via debt , then making that money back via the growth that results from the investment .
[native] it 's exactly what the cap is doing , anyway : turning food producers into land managers .
[native] perhaps you can restate how easier infrastructure planning requires subsidies for land ownership in a way that makes sense .
[non-native] there are some reasons that advertisment shoulds be better than the actual products .
[native] not sure about your laws but here in the states we still lock up men who diddle kids even if they do n't actually `` fuck '' them .
[native] > where do you think russia is heading to ?
[native] and even more so germany was known as one of the kindest imperial leaders and had no intentions of genocidal acts or other war crimes .
[native] it does in a sense , given the time it was implemented & what defined the socioeconomic conditions during the short period it was flown officially .
[native] > are you suggesting that things are worse now than they were 20 + years ago ?
[native] music , art , an alternative culture , pirates , stupid accent , banksy , concord .
[non-native] if advertisements make products look too much better than they are really are , customers may regret the purchase when they have the products in their hands .
[non-native] finally , a young person can enjoy life more than old can do .
[native] which is stupid since amazons website is base in dublin .
[native] can we get a color guide for that geopolitical map of russia ?
[non-native] a person who do not afraid of taking risks , would also be more familiar with the new technology and the changing demands of the society and his work .
[non-native] the advertisements need our life so , it have to send real information or massage .here are some of funny things now .
[non-native] because they do not care so ther are more problem happened .
[non-native] another example of a success based on risks would be gabriel garcia marquez 's new style of writing literature .
[non-native] it would also be a positive criteria for employers when they take people , because then they can be sure that they know what the person is doing and that the person knows as much as possible about what he or she is doing and also the background information that is needed .
[non-native] they must know how they become in this situation and they can use it if it is necessary .
[native] so , in that sense , he is right .
[native] as for your natural selection argument , i fail to understand how you can justify transfering billions to uncompetative states to make them more competative and yet argue against investing in uncompetative industries/businesses until they become more competative .
[non-native] the ideas and concepts should be explained to them clearly and then the student should be made to think on them .

[non-native] second , i think you should experience the proper process .
[native] ahh , i did n't drink much tea while there as it was 30 + the entire week .

[native] you got it wrong way , guy fawkes is the one they are celebrating the death of .
[non-native] for example , the little boy in the cady shop , he would like to have a big colorful cady but not the no color one .
[native] it 's an illustration of why i do n't trust the un 's opinion on anything .
[non-native] i think this is not needed , as different students of course have different strength , not only in life , but also in their academics .

[non-native] given that cars mostly use oil today , many consumers try to decrease their consumption of oil , and as a consequence , they tend to use much less their vehicles .
[non-native] however , they also must by specialize in one subject , because of the link between all that sudgects .
[non-native] so , the example clearly shows how important it is to understand things .
[native] it seems rather difficult for weaker countries to recover if they do not have the investment nessisary to do so .
[non-native] i am sure that this happened to many of you .
[native] we 'd better find some way of scanning their thoughts to make sure they 're not thinking about anything religious too !
[non-native] this self confidence rises the opportunity to be the winner of the challenge .
[native] hey , you do actually have another language you know .
[non-native] however , some people like to travel by themselves ; some people like to travel in a group led by a tour guide .

[native] the ( seeming ) fact that key figures behind the scenes have a family history of fraud and tax evasion ... it all makes me smell a rat .
[non-native] now it might be clear what i mean when i affirm that i do not fully disagree with the statement : it 's a matter of point of view , some life experience can provide success by risk , other can not .i agree with the statement `` most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are ''
[non-native] qualifications for getting permitted to the company are becoming more and more strict as time passes .

[non-native] old people can always enjoy their life in the way they can .
[native] i 'm struggling to find a better phrasing than `` tbh the average person does n't give a fuck , '' but it probably captures the mindset / and i can tell you here and now that nothing of israeli-palestinian history is taught in primary schools .

[native] they 've also stuffed a 10 + million in the us .
[non-native] but i had not too time today to support this and i hope that there will be some change in the life , to give some importance also to this sector .i think it is better to apply a combined approach so that students can obtain a broad perspective about the world with a special insight into certain dynamics .
[native] > what is more damaging : going with the eu its demands and appearing weak in the eyes of the public or making a promise to which you ca n't live up in the long run ?
[non-native] from these points , emphasized advertisment has no problem do ing so , and it is the way to intorduce the product .
[non-native] secondly , having a plently of broad knowledge means having a lot of topics to talk about .
[non-native] although this can not happen , proven by the development speed of contemporary society ( and probably late stanley cubrick 's ` 2001 space odyssey ' ) , who knows ?
[non-native] but i think that travel in other way is still a good way to some people by preparing well .human kinds always need ideas , concepts and facts to reach good life satandards , therefore understanding them is a very important respect for humans life .
[non-native] the other main purpose for which , the number of cars would be incresing that , the population on the earth is incresing day by day , it would be very much difficult for the mass transporation to transport as many as people who are there , therefore many people would be having an eye towards the cars which would lean them towards it .

[non-native] becouse they have more power than old people and more inocent than old people .i disagree with it .
[non-native] the lack of participation in community service among young people results mainly from lack of time .
[non-native] in fact this is the main passage from the young age so my opinion is simply that the society might change to help young to change her .teen age is the important part of one 's life .
[non-native] it is also relevant to measure what cars imply .
[native] on one side are the sincere euro-federalist ideologues ( think guy verhofstadt ) who would probably accept uk leaving if it were the price to pay for creating a superstate which functions better than the status quo .
[native] could n't hotlink this above , but for context : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electoral_college_ ( united_states ) #congressional _ district_method

[native] i state that two nations working together to a common goal ( and who signed a pact ) are allies ( that 's lower-case allies , not upper-case allies ) , so * obviously * i 'm trying to make the western allies ( who are n't fucking involved in this story ) look like perfect golden knights .
[non-native] in my opinion i agree with the statement because i think that in a few years there wouldnt be as much cars as now because other confortable and faster ways of transport will be used , as for example the plane that its at this moment one of the best way of transport or another possibility is using cars that works with solar energy or with water contribuiting with the environmet .

[non-native] since they are old , their phisycial condition is not as well as used to be .
[non-native] moreover , even if they research about them , they know the basic things , so they can improve their knpwledge from other information .

[non-native] if the teachers just give the handouts to the children and let them memorize each fact , they would not benefit from it .
[native] for all the horror the empire inflicted , i still believe it was fundamentally a great achievement for britain and her dominions .

[non-native] in addition , having two experts who do n't understand each other could result in an inferior solution because of the lack of agreement .

[non-native] however , most people seem to fail to account the fact that using the car lead to many problem which can lead to some terrible results , in years ago and even now .
[non-native] during my life i found many reasons that bring me on this idea .
[non-native] first of all , considered with the physical aspect , young people have more energy than older people have .
[non-native] now at this stage they dont have any extra time .
[non-native] after enter university , they are busy to social life such as the party , part-time job , the date . .
[non-native] second , they are not successful people who already know how to do well .
[non-native] the survey rated the community work conducted by the young people more effective then conducted by the people of more mature ages .
[non-native] thus application is important for a student which comes with understanding the subject .
[non-native] when we get these high degrees like we had it this summer , the people will start dying much earlier because of the unhealthy air they inhale .
[non-native] in general , it is because that young people nowadays have so more much responsibilities than they did in the past .
[non-native] the solution to all these problems caused by the increased number of the cars may be promoting the public transportation .
[non-native] for example i have study in scientific school for five years where i must study all the academic subjects ( for example : biology , filosofy , history , english , mathematic , latin . .. )
[non-native] if they have many chances to have , it would be happened more less to confuse their future of to change their major .
[native] in the uk for instance , i 've been treated and seen by a doctor and they basically looked at me ( after a bit of a wait - like two hours ) , poked around a bit and then concluded that i probably had a stuffy nose that has become a sinus infection .
[non-native] they join a tennis club , go to language school and do some volunteer work .
[non-native] i belive that there are mainly three reasons why i agree travelling with a group led by a tour guide .
[non-native] there are a lot of advertisments of many organizations that are looking for young people to help the community and this organizations apply for many different kinds of jobs .
[native] uk is forecasted to be eu 's largest economy by 2030 .
[native] just to get to the great melting pot that america is , took decades of discrimination and instability .
[native] it 's why north korea is still around : china props up the regime so the us ca n't get a foothold so close to it 's border .
[native] there is no reason to expel the israeli ambassador .
[native] in english , the expression `` europe is founded on multilingualism ! ''
[native] do you have any proof that this is propaganda ?
[native] any allegiance they have is to their own cultures and countries .
[non-native] in my university group i am the best in using of computers and when some friends of mine have problem with computer , he ask me how he can to resolve his problem and if he need to repair it , he ask my help too .
[non-native] there are various examples suggesting that the youth is still actively helping their community .
[non-native] but to this question , i will try first to discribe the young people 's view of enjoying life , then i 'll put myself in older people 's shoes .
[non-native] i think olny youg people think that yong people enjoy life more than older people do .
[native] why not advertise some other volunteer brigade , one with less ideologically questionable persuasions ?
[non-native] multiple reasons are alleged , some say they lack of time whereas others accept they are to selfish to help others without a vested interest .
[native] galway is an awesome city as well , and limerick is getting better .
[native] however , the fact that there is no obvious candidate in an organic context matters .
[non-native] while some people are mostly interested in taking a sunbath on the beach or having parties in night clubs ; i would rather try to exchange ideas an opinions with local inhabitants , which is i admit not always a success .
[non-native] in sum , a general perspective and view of things and subjects is required in current scenario .
[non-native] now living in the peaceful and rich life , both can not image when they were child , come to be the turth .
[native] i would think that if a suggests a commissioner and then b approves and acts upon that suggestion , it is apt to say that a has played some role in the election of the commissioner .
[non-native] they show the importance of winning the race only .
[non-native] i do n't think it 's fair to the consumer ( or to the consumer 's pocket ) to be fooled into buying something that does n't match the description he/she had in mind .
[native] i 'm sure you 'll have the time of your life wherever you go though :)
[non-native] specialization is highly prefered according to me because knoweledge is like a ocean .
[non-native] for example , students are wondering where the ideas come from and how they think about it .
[native] in another country , my favorite building would have to be [ charles bridge in prague ] ( http://imgur.com/ydwkpxc ) , if that counts .
[native] if you ca n't think of a real reply , it 's better just to stay quiet .
[non-native] so they came out with the idea of bikes instead of bicycles .
[native] i guess it makes it easier to interpret in 100 years .
[native] nothing speaks of democracy like an oversize 1000 room palace . / s
[native] there is n't that gigantic stigma of using nazi-style symbols there is in the west ; they in any case are ukrainian ultranationalists .
[native] yes , but one statement is true and the other is false .
[non-native] as conclusion i want to say that most advertisement show products much better than they really are , even if part of the responsability for an error in buying an object can in part due to the customers .we can wonder how the amount of cars in the next twenty years will evolve .
[non-native] the last but not least reason is that a giving chance for choosing the specific subject .
[native] somalia is a nice place ... most of the year ... alright for a couple of weeks it 's pretty safe ... ahh fuck it .
[native] > well for one thing , when they split poland down the middle .
[non-native] the second point i want to express is perhaps there are some young people do know that helping their communities is necessary , however they just do n't have time to give .
[native] limerick city centre has seen serious improvement in recent years .
[native] looks like a political cartoon thought up by a small child .
[native] the footage is embodied as the blast knocks glass in the windows of apartment eyewitness .
[native] if you want to see a good film about the life of french minorities that sound similar to what you saw , i highly recommend la haine .
[non-native] another important thing associated with learning only facts is that we still have to climb up a whole mountain in order to reach the idea .
[non-native] moreover i think that a lot of olders , like my grand-grand-mother , was realy traumatished by the second world war .
[native] to pretend the dgs was the only instrument the irish government used is disingenuous in the extreme .
[non-native] also it will help me to go more general place , which means native 's usual place , or if my new friends come to my contry , i will help them , either .
[native] the sps was only implemented ten years ago and represented a massive change from how things were undertaken in the past .
[non-native] but i guess that , over the years , one gathers experience , and eventually knows what to believe and what not to .i think that this statement is a real view of the today 's life of the young people and not only .
[non-native] but , will this trend continue in the following years ?
[native] he means the influence brussels has over the uk .
[non-native] as a result the flaws of one would be covered by the good thing of the other and viceversa .
[native] all data says the standards of living are rising again .
[native] > he would be mocked from all sides , but he would have been honest that 's great until it massively drives support for ukip and we leave the eu .
[native] the uk is n't even part of the schengen area .
[non-native] that makes them cheaper and many people buy these to save money and still get very good products .
[native] [ the gdp per capita of the gdr was less than half that of the west ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/09/west-east-germany-split ) around the time of reunification .
[non-native] in order to give employees payments , the companies must have consumers to consume their products .
[non-native] some companies facilitate these service learning projects by providing initial fundings and organising competitions .
[native] i am not saying i dislike it i am just curious why .
[non-native] how can a teacher teach history class without using facts ?
[non-native] if your boss like the project , that is really lucky and good for you but normally that is really hard .
[non-native] in real life facts about the life , its existence are developed by concepts of science .
[native] it has to be agreed upon by the irish government before it becomes binding .
[non-native] this is because all the fields of specialisation mentioned above are entirely different from each other .
[native] but that 's not what the article was about , and that 's not what i was talking about .
[non-native] in order to get educated , they either have to find a professional who majors in that particular field or go to a school/college .
[native] i 'd pick the latter , and therefore cameron took the wrong decision in my eyes .
[non-native] he used to talk about those shows for many days .
[native] i take it there 's a strong linguistic and cultural divide between turkish and greek now .
[non-native] then my world would be more expand and life will be more enjoyable .
[non-native] they want to entertain you but these kind of stuff become annoying afterten minutes .
[non-native] in that age they have oppurtunity to mould character .
[non-native] but in general , what is the best way ?
[non-native] so , when they try to promot a new produce , the only thing they have to do is think about how to let the ad looks better .
[native] like if your country has restrictions on welfare , you could loosen those restrictions for as long as they live in rural or low-population areas .
[non-native] it must be the most important memory in their whole life .
[non-native] they can plane to a get a small car which fits there budgets and satisfy there daily needs .
[native] everyone reads the headlines , nobody bothers with the article .
[native] otoh though , one great problem with arguments for theism or atheism is that they often consider hidden assumptions , which usually boils down to `` is it likely that god exists '' , ending up in a circular argument .
[non-native] the young people nowadays think only about to theirself .
[native] culture is not a mathematical equation , it ca n't be quantified and there are as many interpretations of what a countries culture is as there are people that have heard of that country .
[native] the ukrainians that celebrate bandera and the upa today , i would say over 95 % of them bear no ill-will towards polish people .
[non-native] in my opinion , young people think better than older people do because they know that health is important than wealth .as time goes by , many different education syles are coming up .
[native] the central bank is an independent body operating at arms-length from the government with a mandate to `` promote the economic and financial well-being of canada . ''
[non-native] besides the activities that are suitable for the young people , it is no doubt that the young people are more sensitive to newly-emerging things and terms , because their knowledge structure is not set , so they dare and are willing to taste things that are new to them .
[non-native] working whit other people gives us competition , and i think it 's very important to increase our knowledge .
[native] i 'm fucking amazed by this mindblowing information you 've shared with me .
[native] edit : oh man , he nearly lost it at ~ 8:40 `` northern ireland should be the one not using the pound ... '' `` uhhhhh ... i 'm not sure i follow your logic ''
[native] there 's a reason we are `` the great satan '' and putins worse enemy and you are not .
[non-native] those companies stays for long time their success is in making the goods in convincible manner .
[native] i guess asian languages would be more useful here but i 'm hoping to end up in europe , and i do n't really like the sound of chinese or japanese to be honest ( the only asian languages which are widely taught here ) .
[native] what the hell happens to me if scotland seperates ?
[non-native] no tour guide , no group , just a backpack and a city map .
[native] ah sure we 'll take it here in ireland .
[non-native] according to me i do n't agree to the perception that , if the advertisement is good , the product is always good and reliable .
[native] meanwhile , judicial appointments to judicial posts in the so-called `` inferior '' or `` provincial '' courts are made by the local provincial governments .
[native] it 's hard to understand when you do n't get discriminated against everyday by people just because they are ` uncomfortable ' or find you disgusting .
[native] you said > how almost every straight person will use casual homophobia , and then not realise how much calling bad things `` gay '' can fuck with a teenagers perception of themselves and the world around them .
[native] ~ ~ based on your argument , france should annex belgium .
[native] wait until the next time there 's another police shooting in america of a black kid or there 's a discussion about the roma or muslims on * this * subreddit .
[native] could n't believe the happy ending was being accepted for an internship at an insurance company : a licence to pay less than minimum wage while not having to commit to hire .
[non-native] you have to understand the technical issues as good as possible .
[native] so if your issue is that american 's do n't get to see them enough , why are n't you posting it in american subreddits instead of / r/europe ?
[non-native] for example in chaina the people started using bicycles insted of cars .
[non-native] if traveling alone , it wo n't be able to have much fun as traveling with group .
[non-native] having a sepcific but deep knowledge about one subject .
[native] not sure what they could give up for russia to feel it got a win .
[non-native] but advertisements will be presented in all media like newspaper , tv commercials , street signs as if it is for all mankind .
[native] this also is n't cheap to investigate and give the `` all clear '' to .
[native] it 's relevant when discussing turkish relations , since turkey is a reason why a third of the island is occupied by an unrecognized state .
[non-native] however it also had a price tag of around $ 10,000 and it failed miserably .
[native] i mean the nation with the largest land military and the largest security apparatus suddenly failed for no reason .
[native] europeans misusing the flag does not change its inherent american ( real ) symbolism .
[native] if he is smart he will have other people do the dirty work , then pretend he isnt the one behind the controls .
[non-native] trying new things and taking risks are the significant parts of the succes ' i completely agree with this idea and my arguments for that point are listed as follows
[native] our countries are very much different culturally and thats a very good thing .
[native] most instances of isds are pretty reasonable , and even the phillip morris one has some backing ( tobacco company suing australia over plain packaging of cigarettes ) .
[native] the couple can not raise more than one child because the whole proceedure of the surrogacy was expensive .
[non-native] i am agree with the above statement because of the following reasons .
[non-native] we most dont use two many of cars and we most not thrw the garbeg in the see , becouse we wont to live a helthy live with our family and our friends , there are some boats thrw the oil in the see and revers it kills every theing live under wotar .
[native] because one law for 500 million people in 28 diverse countries is a monumentally stupid idea as demonstrated by the last decade of european stagnation .
[native] nah americans dislike cash ( it 's pretty rare to purchase something as large as a meal in cash ) and we especially hate coins .
[non-native] the itinerary of a group tour can not be flexible very much .
[non-native] because somebody hate and think that it is unreasonable design .
[non-native] all in all , from my point of view , advertisements often pretend to give a certain use to the person that buys the product , but in the end it 's often just wishful-thinking .most of the time , youth is remembered as days of happiness and good memories .
[non-native] when i am still a child my parents tells me a lots of stuffs , but i even ask about why , beacuse i never think about the things , after i grows up to teenige , i start to ask why , because i am starting learing thing in to my hand .
[native] hopefully it wo n't grow too much , especially given gerry adams ' leadership of the party .
[non-native] these kind of mass media can give the reader more colorful and lively demonstrations .
[native] while previously in my life i was the oldest kid in the neighborhood .
[non-native] either because they think `` i 'm not going to do it , someone else can do it. '' or they think `` if nobody is cleaning it , why should i ? ''
[non-native] first , it is true that there are many people who go to their offices or schools by car .
[native] relevant : ria novosti & other outlets have been faking news of osce visits in donetsk & lughansk .
[non-native] so i would definetly agree with given the statement .
[native] i remember him saying that the iron curtain would fall in my life-time , but probably not in his .
[native] but given the eu 's recent penchant for self-inflicted economic damage it really would n't surprise me .
[non-native] for these three reasons i strongly think that cars will be fewer in the futur and new inventions will be invented to save the world from the crowd which is every where and to save the world from the pollution .party going , loud , naughty , nasty fast drivers , rule breakers . ..
[native] the political left are the greatest supporters of national fragmentation around the world , be it in catalonia , scotland , basque country , turkey etc.
[native] i do n't understand what russia is trying to get out of this ?
[native] unless you hate the cold climate , which most old people do .
[non-native] now nobody could do medical research before specializing in this specific area .
[non-native] even tough i accept not all of us are good in everything or have the ability of all fields `` know-hows '' , i sustain a tolerant person is one who moves easily from one knowledge to another and who respect other subjects ' complexity .

[native] and not just the source document , but to also give me the page number and quote the relevant text yourself ?
[non-native] in particular trhere are two elementse most important than the other used in an advetisement : price and quality of goods .
[native] no dude , being against * those kinds of people * is n't islamophobia or bigotry , it 's just * common sense * , d'uh !
[native] i think latin has higher jurisdiction because it was used for an extensive period of time ( thousands of years ... )
[native] so , we ca n't jump to conclusions about pujol , because the case is under investigation , which now * does n't * imply much about guilt ?
[native] > chinese yup , at least the pro-government crowd .
[non-native] as a conclusion i think you chose to enjoy your life regardless your age .
[native] indeed , japanese is a language isolate like basque with no known relatives other than the closely-related ryÅ«kyÅ« languages spoken in southern japan .
[native] that 's an awful lot of modern technology they have to do away with .
[native] the mural kind of reminds me of fremont st. in downtown las vegas .
[non-native] a work is submitted to us and our manager asked to do it separately and who will do it first they will given bonus in salary and who will fail to do it they will be removed from the company .
[native] those countries think that 's what austerity is because they 've never lived with instituionalised corruption .
[non-native] nowdays , it is true that most of them prefer to learn facts .
[native] some crimes ( usually murder ) do not have a statute of limitations
[native] the peace walls are where the extreme minorities of both communities happen to live side by side .
[native] we were naive new zealand backpackers and did n't get to see much of the countryside , acommodation for foreigners was expensive .
[non-native] it is clear that in all works you need capacities of memory , but to understand the situation and to act in consequences is much more useful .
[native] they clearly realized that the pronunciation of the name was a problem for international recognition .
[non-native] being experienced will never be a bad thing when it comes to being successful .
[native] it 's one thing to say that low tariffs is a good thing , it 's quite another to disallow any move by a government to make a law that favours domestic industry over foreign industries ( such as subsidies ) .
[non-native] we make use of it not only on the working , but also in our personal life .
[native] but it 's not up to the austrian parliament to decide that , countries just ca n't all of a sudden say ` nope , it 's mixed competence so you ca n't do that ' .
[non-native] beinf successful in the eyes of the others is one thing , feeling successful and happy is a totally diferent matter , that might imply to satisfy one 's curiosity and follow one 's dreams .
[non-native] he ask me a question , did you always following the book and learn facts , i said yes , beacuse book always right .
[non-native] anybody in that case would want to make a place for their community in this expanding world .
[non-native] society is growing at a super fast speed , and a high efficienty is needed for people to maintain the modern tight life style .
[non-native] the company owner itself or the person acts on the advertisements may lie .
[native] the language used in `` old keivan rus '' circa 900 was indistinguishable from any other slavic language because the divergence did not happen yet .
[native] edit : i 've never been downvoted this much before , for asking a simple question
[non-native] for example , in the clothing advertisement we can see the idealy good shaped person wearing the product .
[non-native] you do n't have the time to enjoy life .
[non-native] even though when i learn the facts i usually dont get the esence of the lesson , i get better grades .
[native] ah yeah , but that 's a fairly inane comparison .
[non-native] similarly we are using mathematics for solving lot of problems in phycics , chemistry , space related problems .
[non-native] there are not so many mutual relationship between the young people such as high school students and the people living in the area where the school locates or their own house locates .
[non-native] is this product as good as the advertisement you see ?
[native] what i 'm saying is that italy works for the people in power and i fear that if you all depart , they 've removed the resistance to change .
[non-native] for example , when i was a junior at chuo high school , located north of tokyo , i joined the tour to kyoto , a traditional area in japan , with my friends of the swimming club .
[native] if everyone that had been accused of being a shill on reddit , actually was , it would be a trillion dollar industry .
[native] i was led to believe that parliament approved or dismissed the commission as a whole , rather than individual commissioners .
[non-native] it seems to me that advertisment shows the product much better than real picture of the things .
[native] are you simply not aware that there are dozens and dozens of perfectly functioning nuclear plants dotted around the eu right now , at this very moment , as we speak ?
[non-native] if they did n't understand , it is very easy to forget and hard time to understand again .
[non-native] moreover , the economy of china is booming up since late of 90 's , and oil demands are sharply increased because china buys considerable amount of oil all over the world .
[native] people are not paid for months , not paid for overtimes , scared that they lose job - lots of stress which also kills them prematurely .
[native] junqueras has said that independence will make catalan society more equal and mas more prosperous .
[native] you 're looking at nations too much at an individual level .
[non-native] secondly when you understand a idea then you dont commit mistakes on that particular topic .
[non-native] there are thousands of junior volounteering groups all across united states witnessing this fact .
[native] if that 's your definition of `` ally '' , then you must logically believe that no two nations have ever been allied in human history .
[native] i 'm not old enough to remember the troubles and i got taught surprisingly little ( nothing ! )
[native] i know that it 's uncouth in europe to rush a meal , but in the us we often are n't looking to spend 3 hours in a restaurant .
[non-native] so i disagreeto the statement , because it shows me that the difference of age cause some difference on enjoying life .
[non-native] i disagree with the idea that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
[non-native] so , in conclusion , all of us have to try to show the truth of every thing because it is the best way to make the other trust us .it has been such a long time since i completed my academic education and has been working as a professional that it is impossible for me not to agree with this statement .
[non-native] they will not be messed up with are other subjects .
[native] its still surprising though - finland is supposedly [ the least corrupt nation in the world alongside us ] ( http://www.transparency.org/cpi2012/results ) but we seem to take it much more seriously - recently it was alleged that a police officer ignored a rape complaint against the teenage son of another police officer and the * prime minister himself * called it `` disturbing '' .
[native] i doubt many of those fleeing are gay , but if so , then yes there 's grounds for asylum .
[non-native] only science courses but in arts and social science courses .

[native] yea tell that to the ukrainians governing crimea , wait you cant , there are none .
[non-native] and even if they do devote some time , it is not a concious effort .
[native] > not all that hard to believe , since the us tried numerous times [ 1 ] to kill castro and had allende murdered .
[native] however , i do agree with you that the chance of the reu and the uk agreeing a mutually acceptable deal are very unlikely , which is why my strong preference is for a brexit as soon as possible .
[non-native] but if you go in the cities you see many kids who are laughing at homeless people , who are angry about them and who say that they should be taken away by someone .
[non-native] now im a physic , and the most part of my personal world is ruled by mathematical laws , equallities , operators and overwhelming logic .
[non-native] however , if we can travel in the group led by a tour guide , they can arrange the time for us .
[non-native] so they enjoy knowing new things , new people , new ways of thinking .
[non-native] so they can not get profit from the local lines and they have to cut the lines .
[non-native] one might assume that academic achievement and the fulfillment of the need for social interaction are the only two major challenges youth is facing nowadays .
[non-native] in my opinion young people have changed the value to enjoy whit to go out .
[non-native] from these reasons , i think this statement young people enjoy life more than old people do .
[native] in my mind it is n't even desirable and i would vote against it in any referendum .
[non-native] i think it 's about his attitude , he take risk of computer system dos .
[native] they could have held out a while longer , sure , but there is no doubt they would have lost regardless .
[native] fighting for their country 's judicial sovereignty and independence , how terrible .
[native] > yet no one is talking about germans making too few babies [ actually ... ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/sep/08/germany-little-growth-few-babies )
[native] it 's funny that people are trying to make something of this .
[native] the centralist would like to see the autonomous regions absorbed by the central government leaving only the provinces and some people like me would like to see the provinces be absorbed the autonomous region .
[native] you do n't have some secret knowledge no one else does .
[native] so they aim to trade jobs for concessions like national treatment there .
[native] more like because it 's not illegal , and because it 's easier to integrate them .
[native] on the other hand [ a countryman of ours ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chaim_herzog ) has been president of israel which no american can say , so maybe even israelis recognise the wisdom of listening to irishmen .
[non-native] finally , because just thanks of the union of many academic subjects all of the scienses are growing and increasing their knowledgements very fast .
[native] if he did n't post them , i would n't bother trying to tell him where he 's wrong .
[native] he really doubts their nato membership is worth the paper its written on .
[native] it would probably be better if ireland just gave the uk a lump sum of money for military expenditure , economy of scale and all that and have the uk sign a treaty that we would defend ireland at all costs .
[native] iirc they do about as much trade with the us and canada as they do with the rest of europe anyway .
[native] grammatically it is by far the closest to latin ; from vocabulary italian is the a bit closer to latin , closer being '' % of words that are related '' .
[non-native] nowadays , when faced such a problem , some people believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , others , on the contrary , seem to have opposite opinions .
[non-native] the company still can offer good service and good stuuff to the costemes .i disagree with the points that understanding ideas and concepts are more important than learning facts .

[native] in the journalist defence , the report does clearly state on page 6 `` russia has fallen the most in europe russia is the worst performing country in europe this year , falling seven places on the prosperity index to 68th . ''
[native] the actual degree of `` client state '' varies , but there 's no doubt that these countries will , more or less , follow us foreign policy on major issues .
[non-native] to my mind , it is necessary for success to walk on new ways .
[native] you realize that ` refugee ' has a specific meaning right ?
[non-native] one reason that i can support is that i can control the time by myself .
[native] i 'm not claiming my view is right because i 'm an economist .
[non-native] for example , we can find what we are good at and after we graduated from school we can find a relative job .
[native] otherwise , there 's not a great deal you can do - most people have made up their minds and no amount of arguing will change them .
[non-native] but they need a specific knowledge for each situation .
[native] the fact is that google provides free and open search of information , while chinese search engines do n't .
[non-native] furthermore , what would happen with the big car manufacturers ?
[native] people do n't dislike paying more because they 've been conned into believing it 's a deliberate attack on britain by a right-wing press .

[native] however , look at the french in mali , they 're doing quite well and have refused us support .
[native] i do n't know what kind of orwellian backwater you live in , but where i 'm from the crime actually has to have occurred .
[native] i think the eu drivers license will still be retained for use in the uk and the eu roaming/data fees are a minimal issue !
[non-native] if in the area where they are going to biuld this new restaurant are some chiness , greek , or text mexican food , but they do not have a real mexican food , i think that the best thing they can do is started a restauran that it is not in this area .
[non-native] second , there will be fewer population in twenty years .
[non-native] in a way , young people are involved in another community .
[non-native] all those things might lead to the slow discrease of the number of cars .
[native] if the eu , even finland , is attacked , america is going to war because to not would risk our relationship with our other nato & eu members * ( which annoys me to a certain degree since countries can basically use the eu to get american protection while ignoring nato commitments ) * .
[non-native] it fails to teach students the real meanings of education .
[non-native] for example , when i was middle school student , at first time of math class , i could n't understand what teacher said .
[non-native] if you are very good in speeches you could become a teacher or a translater .
[native] thatcherism did n't help either when the coal mines in the south west and large industry in the north was closed down .
[non-native] the x can not show the same effect as it has made on the beautiful model .
[non-native] this can be said because if an adult were to jump around naked in his/her yard , he would get caught by the police .
[non-native] this student can work in corporate hospitals which are related to cardiology .
[non-native] 4. we may get discounted tickets for tourist attractions .
[non-native] this makes them indifferent to the problems of the community .
[native] nevermind , it probably just sounds normal to you .
[non-native] and we can take example on these one , because they are a good melt of a raisonable mind and of an aventurer spirit .there are a lot of people travelling on vacation .
[native] this might boost their numbers slightly , but the mafia are nowhere near the same position of power they once had .
[non-native] so , let 's begin with the young people .
[non-native] keep working on something they already know how to do well is the way to be successful and saving time .
[non-native] craig keilburger , matt johnson are two vivid and huge examples .
[non-native] before young people start to help the community , they have to grow up bzy themselves .
[native] though , if he were forced to backtrack and pay before the next general election , it would become much harder for him to win the next general election .
[non-native] i sometimes have the feeling that they do n't see the nature catastrophies out there , which are our faults , too .
[non-native] it is also true that as you get older , your brains develops in different steps and so you can think more deeply about things that interest or bother you .
[native] france , germany ( and obviously the uk ) are all relatively inward looking right now and not able to deal with hungary .
[native] the scariest issue is that the post-wwii world order that did n't allow any country to annex other territories by armed force has crumbled .
[non-native] iin conclusion i think that the solution are two or the goverment of all wori do agree with the statement that `` successful people try new things and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' .
[non-native] and i think that is the meaning of success .
[non-native] are n't you going to enjoy your life when you are older ?i agree that .
[native] but do other `` big players '' such as france and germany get a lot in return ?
[native] / u/unidan and / u/wil might come through with a cartoon too .
[non-native] maybe i 'm too confuse so i write an exemple : once i finish studing , i know what i want to do do but i do n't know if i can find what i 'm lookin ' for , so is better to me to be prepared on various subject .
[native] i only ask as i 'm from a country which had compulsory voting , and rather than not show up , people turned up and submitted wasted votes ( drawing cocks on ballot papers etc. )
[non-native] donate money to age old homes , destitute , blinds etc. , they help these communities one wat or the other by voluntarily servicing them .
[native] this proves that the u.s. has lots of secret conspiracies .
[non-native] from child to adult people have to do a lot of education and gain some practical experience .
[native] other cities faced similar scorched earth tactics , but warsaw would be faced with systematic destruction .
[native] the fact that it 's been posted here means you really should call in a tip regardless of how you actually feel about his decision .
[non-native] which takes place in the other end of our street .
[non-native] first , trying something new can only be positive .
[native] i do n't speak for all americans , but i do because of my interest in the greater world , especially in areas that are relatively similar ( both in development and in general values ) .
[non-native] even though there idea or way of enjoyment is different .
[native] and known for thimun when i was a student .
[native] businesses that hid behind tax evasion and artifically low interest rates were suddenly confronted with a new environment , and ridges labour laws only worsened the situation .
[native] > the other stance of `` lets all gang up on crimea because they decided to be part of russia rather then ukraine '' - well that 's just plain evil as you are attempting to outright force your will on them .
[native] north dakota is leading the way at 2.8 % .
[native] i 'm a staunch theist by the way ( do n't kill me ) , but apparently nobody even notices when i 'm online .
[non-native] as a teenager , i am fond of challenging myself and like to take advertrues as well .
[native] [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russians_in_estonia#current_situation ) there was also a minor border dispute with russia that was settled in feb 2014 .
[native] as a new zealand i am not happy with this .
[non-native] i believe the companies might exagaruate in nature of the advertisnemnt , but it will maintain an acceptable level of truth on the advertiement for future uses .
[non-native] on the other side there are some disadvantages in having a broad knowledge .
[native] although , that being said , there needs to be some sort of alternative to training or living in poverty with no money if there are no jobs .
[non-native] understanding ideas and concepts can lead to a better understanding of the topic .
[non-native] the long and the short of it is that , the more advertisements producers will have the oppotunity to attract the people 's attention , the more people would like to buy the items shown in the advertisements .i believe that , it is never good to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
[native] edit : jesus , just looked at your posting history .
[native] is it supposed to be satire , like * the daily show * ?
[non-native] during the process of examing those projects , it will be difficult for persons majoring in financing to analyzing the prospect of project such as steal , mobile and telecommunication .
[non-native] these countries , unlike developed countries , where cars have been almost satuated , markets for cars here are huge .
[native] if i was asserting a position on free passage through territorial waters or the territorial integrity of first nations , everyone would be happy to be reminded about what canada 's positions and history are on these subjects .
[non-native] the amount of money they would earn after a good advertisement can block the eyes of the producers /one of the most contraversial and hot topic that has been discussed for a long time is that whether an advertisement can change the image of the product in a better way than the product actually is .
[non-native] however , if you travel alone without a tour guide , you are been deprived of the pleasures of communication with your friends .
[non-native] it is more economical to be in a group .
[native] > america would be less inclined to quid pro quos many american politicians are in favour of bringing uk into us trade arrangements ( for example , gingrich wanted to in the 90s when he was house speaker ) .
[native] but if they 're so far down that they do n't believe the western media , they obviously have an anti-western stance .
[non-native] advertisements use that idea to sell their products althought the diet drink are not really working like that way .
[non-native] in finally , the young should have spare time to help their community .
[native] what i do n't get is what on earth where people shop has to do with it .
[non-native] for example , when i went to london for the first time with my sister we went to every where just to find a good place to enjoy our time there and when we found the nice one we were exotic and we could not really enjoy our time then but if we were with a tour guide this will never happen .
[non-native] if students would be more encouraged to learn facts first of all , it could be a little bit `` dangerous '' for them because their own way of critic could be affected whatever the subject is .
[non-native] but i think that mankind will finally overcome this concern , at least when it is forced to do so , by using alternative energy .
[non-native] whene you have any problems in your travel there will be somone to share with and aske for help .
[native] but how are your political views relevant to this conversation ?
[native] that 's often said but what are the staunch reforms ireland has implemented ?
[native] he was the one to insert the `` only '' qualifier .
[non-native] yes i totally agreewith the statement that the student have to understand the ideas and the concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
[native] i know a guy that was very active in a student tory organization in yorkshire and they were a sizable mob .
[native] yeah , james connolly was a popular halloween costume back then .
[non-native] so no one can say any thing about that .
[native] apologies if it sounded aggressive , but consistently focusing the debate on a weaker eu or exit from the union hinders the ability to move forward and approach growth and reform in ways that benefit the union as a whole
[non-native] for example , if we have a mathematical subject in our graduation course , it is very difficult to solve the problems if we are unable to understand the ideas and concepts .
[non-native] the cars generate pollution overall with consquence on the environment and the rosource are less than some yers ago the usefull of train , metro , tram could represent a solution to the problem of pollution and congestion but this type of vehicle must be more efficient than today .
[native] the eu is essentially trying to shit in russia 's bed .
[non-native] first , the main factor that the avertisemt is good is , it shows with low price to attrack audine .
[native] i think we now have over a million uk nationals in a population of ~ 22million .
[non-native] and also , there are some dangers in some resorts , which the guide knows well .
[native] on the subject of conspiracy theorists , here 's the latest post by the op here : [ what you are really objecting to is that the default trust which the supporters of these things used for so long to slip them in under the radar is gone .
[non-native] hence , it can be averred that young people are able to enjoy life more than their older counterparts .
[non-native] with the huge amount of knowledge we have gathered today this is no more possible .
[non-native] then , we need to know why those who try now things are successful people .
[native] mate , the topic was about gm fears and monsanto , and you decided to charge on in and say i 'm ` white knighting ' for monsanto when really i was laughing at the ridiculous claims anti-gm people make about the company .
[native] i think the best improvement for limerick was dublin coach .
[non-native] they actually can do , and they do , that .the question whether traveling in an organized tour with a guide is an enjoyable enterprise depends very much on the travel destination , the personal travel companions , and the physical fitness required for a certain trip .
[native] the only thing it brings to the table is nuclear weapons , and since india and china already have them , that 's not really a huge deal .
[native] sent tony abbott back to england , so he can destroy them instead of us .
[native] we 've been at peace since because of nato and nukes .
[non-native] the first summer vacation that my parents and i went to japan , i was only six years old .
[native] it seems with the post-communist countries especially , there are many gems hidden by horrible architecture , so i could understand belgrade being like that .
[native] it very much does exist in civil law countries .
[non-native] finally , i conclude that it is advisable to be specialized in one specific subject rather than havingf broadened knowledge of many subjects .a graet man said before in a long time ago `` the small ones are the once who rise the city up or take it down '' .
[non-native] of course , i did n't notice any difference to my hair growth rate , even after two months of usage .
[native] european commission presidents are appointed by a qmv of the heads of state of the member states , whilst the european council president is done by just the heads of state of the member states .
[native] just to clarify i used the term `` mapping '' , not in the cartographic sense , but in the abstract sense of testing boundaries and reactions , which is how all of those incursions are being performed .
[native] russia has an economy the size of italy ... britain , france , and germany are all larger .
[native] whenever i see a post about roma or young arabs doing something illegal there are always quite a few racist posts that get upvoted .
[non-native] plus , once they have understood a certain concept they often feel proud of themselves which gives motivation for further learning .
[native] the main reason i bring it up is because to be effective some regulations need to be implemented globally to ensure risk does n't just jump the boarder and give those who do n't enact regulation an unfair advantage just because they have fewer regulations .
[native] even if you 're a more preferred immigrant and perhaps do have an it or other job where you can speak english , you wo n't be able to communicate with the majority of people in public situations .
[non-native] the spectator thinks he or she could be this human and gets more atractive if he or she buys the product .
[native] you 've been taught well by the looks of it !
[non-native] so , we have started a compain not to use a car even a day a week .
[native] the better title if your goal is ensuring a ukip government in a couple years , yeah .
[native] there are hundreds of potential origin-destination pairs between malaga and amsterdam .
[native] whereas far-right parties are gaining momentium in most european countries , ireland , it is the far-left .
[non-native] just few japanese were living in new york and nobody had n't tried to come studying hair cut .
[native] there have been repeated wails of `` benefit tourism !!! ''
[native] anti-interventionism , nuclear disarmament and withdrawl from nato in order to pursue these aims 9 .
[native] if you 're interpreting it to mean something different , then that just means you are unfamiliar with the terminology , not that other people do n't know what they 're talking about .
[native] new zealand did similar ridiculous things until 1982 to keep money in the country .
[native] besides , we have witnessed what open boarders has done to the united kingdom : wages plummeted and house prices skyrocketed .
[non-native] the first reason that caused the young people ca n't devote more time to their communities is that the high competitive pressure in the education system .
[native] should of done 3 votes over the course of the year , one in jan , july and dec.
[native] or are you talking about the public debate in general ; because the uk seems to just shout about not wanting legislation of the particular moment and then use that fact to attempt to extract concessions from future agreements .
[non-native] second is about a sentence or a new vocabulary that you have never seen before .
[non-native] although , older people do earn money , travel a lot it is the yougsters who make their way a step higher in all respects .
[native] > it is better to havea neo-nazi brigade than no brigade .
[non-native] having broader knowledge in all the other fields does n't help us to do well in the present field .
[native] no one will scold you for but you parents and a lot of relatives if their generation or older will be visibly disappointed and for most people they 're happy living an irreligious life with the faÃ§ade of being religious to keep the older relatives happy .
[native] i 'd love to see a map of yes/aye/si / oui/ja - the verbal upvote sound that people make when listening .
[native] should 've had it in a safe ... any sensible gun owner has tight security for their firearms * specifically * to avoid other people taking them and doing these terrible things .
[non-native] this shows that intensive knowledge is necessaru than one specific subject .
[non-native] however , i think that it is also very important for them to be able to structure every thing .
[non-native] they call me because they know i am able in using computer and they call me only in this cases .
[native] do bulgarians still put up posters and photos of dead friends ?
[native] well , your oh-so-hilarious photo mock-up did n't turn out to be all too close to reality , did it ?
[non-native] for example consider young people they have lot of time to enjoy with their cousins and friends , but older people meet with thier cousins when they attend party .
[native] the sinister-side to this is that the turkish gov ' t might want to turn syria into a protectorate .
[native] if spain is part of europe then so was muslim andalusia , same thing with hungary , romania , the balkans and southern italy during their periods of muslim rule .
[native] it 's a little known fact that russian tanks are so advanced that they 're sentient and entitled to leave .
[native] because bloody gets attached to `` bloody foreigners ! '' .
[native] it should n't be your apartment , but unfortunately , at the moment , it is .
[non-native] boys want to wear nike shoes because michael jordan wears it on tv and girls want to buy some specific type of dress , for example , levi 's low rise jeans because jenifer lopez or brittany spears wear it on tv .
[native] no , that 's just the american way of writing law .
[native] it 's not black and white , i think a lot of young catalan nationalists assume this to be a simple left or right issue .
[non-native] in that nine month , every young person can help their community and the hole society .
[native] did n't realize a nazi iron cross was an anti-israel symbol .
[non-native] first , i think that learning facts without trying to deeply understand their origin is useless .
[native] if fianna fÃ¡il had any stones they would 've called the fucker 's bluff and told him to fuck off .
[native] his intentions were n't to end the monarchy , it was to force a king of his religion .
[native] however there seems to be a trend that the lower the office the more prevalent the corruption in europe ( some would say in the us it 's the other way around , due to the ( lack of ) campaign financing laws ) .
[non-native] so the business changed from a `` soap business '' to the chewing gum one .
[non-native] to sum up , the teenagers help their own communities more than others .in my opinion , the appropriatness of traveling in a group led by a tour guide depends on the nature of the person and the place to be travelled .
[native] passing propaganda disinformation as real news almost never happens .
[native] i wrote a post about it [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2ewgn3/lets_have_a_discussion_about_the_ttip/ ) a few weeks ago .
[non-native] i think facts are basic things to understand things and they are both real and nondebated things .
[non-native] poeple are sometimes so disapointed even loose money that they call an attorneyof course i completly agree with that statement .
[native] you could also read one of the great authors if you do n't have a day off anytime soon .
[non-native] the usage of cars is directly propotional to the demand of cars , which i believe will increasely significantly as we move on .
[non-native] they had been a great success for nokia , siemens etc .
[non-native] i am the main person of the next show so i can not quit practing .
[native] that 's what comes up on a google search ...
[non-native] many parents think that it is better for their kids to focus on their school work in order to enter a good unversity .
[native] it did adopt russian vowel reduction , and spell vowels reduced , though , which makes for `` a '' all over the place .
[non-native] when i was there i realized that more than in italy people need a car , because of the long distances and because of the fact that they live independently from their family .
[non-native] companies not only exagrrate the abilities of products , but also transfer the costs to the consumers .on the one hand , i agree in some ways with the statement saying that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' for specific reasons .
[native] we might 've caught more flack in the short-term , but at least it would 've been better for our long-term image instead of damaging it for decades to come .
[native] we 're disproportionately likely to commit suicide , be homeless , suffer from depression , etc etc.
[non-native] this is because they scarcely have time to volunteer .
[native] i do n't think much of our accent , but a higher class new zealand accent is probably closer to rp british than an australians would be .
[native] > except that ` net contribution ' does n't account for the depression of native employment and their burden on the state that would be a good argument were it not for the fact that there 's no statistically significant effect on `` native '' employment levels as a result of eu migration .
[non-native] as a business student , i would say that it is more important to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , because it allows you to speak with more people , and developp your own personality .
[native] singling out rt just because it does n't harsh on putin 's government is a double standard that no news agency lives up to .
[non-native] because he was looking for a nwe thing which he needs in his life and it was completely new thing maybe he took risks because it wouldnt be a succesfsful device and after the bell we communication improved and for the present there are mobile phones in our lifes also mobile phone was the new thing before 5 years but now we are looking for some new things . .
[native] they 're probably just watching tv or reading a book .
[non-native] as it is so fashional that its user has been basically limited to the young people .
[non-native] all courses that i have done during my bachelor degree and also courses that i 'm making in my master of science , spend so much time for showing ideas and concepts and not for presenting facts .
[native] an asylum seeker can be anyone , they just need to be trying to ` seek asylum ' .
[native] i think if you look at the beginning of the chart ( from the left ) you can see that a plurality of the poorest people are africans , then asian-pacific , then indian , then european , then north american and then latin american .
[non-native] if people use public transportation together , it would help keeping air cleaner than using own cars .
[native] china is a bit worse , but so it the us .
[non-native] for example if a actor is using a particular brand of perfume then his/her fans do follow him without actually considering the quality .
[non-native] so , some amount of broad broad knowledge is generally built in to our academics .
[non-native] but he can not get any good money from it .
[non-native] so i think if we can encourage the young people to helping their communities in many different ways that will bring people close of their communities .
[non-native] using pop stars or overstating their effects is one of their ways to sell their products .
[non-native] for example , most people are about to do the same way that someone changed his or her hairstyle , and after all the hairstyle is popular in all of the world .
[native] > they see what 's written in the daily mail and the sun and about how many immigrants are ` flooding our borders ' and make an opinion about the entire eu based on that .
[native] us laws are now so large and complex that they incorporate a legal structure that allows them to grow as new instances arise : the frank-dodd act being a prominent example of regulation that requires regulators to create more regulations as cases present themselves .
[native] [ ironically our air force has a picture of a flightless bird on it ] ( http://www.usnzcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/rnzaf-logo.png )
[native] many new zealand soldiers had likely had little to no interactions with maori at the time , so the post war period marked a change for the better in race relations .
[native] and the government do n't attempt to make them trust either - you should listen to a chinese official ( not of mofa ) make a speech .
[native] so what is the public supposed to base their opinions on , eh ?
[native] i mean , really , we should just assume that the people of today totally support those actions from 70 years ago .
[native] it 's a byproduct of the material conditions - not because someone is an evil individual .
[native] in the meantime , the international reaction is to issue a couple of ceasefire demands , but the arabs , seeing the path to tel aviv laid before them , refuse to countenance the idea of a ceasefire .
[non-native] in one time , students only learnt courses by heart and sometimes they did not understand .
[native] wait for a revolution and support it when it comes , not outright invade
[native] yes , i looked at the figures and you 're right .
[non-native] therefore , i think that there should be a commitee to supervise what is being mentioned in advertisments .in general , i agree with the statement because i think that a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more precious to people when it comes to their every daily life and surrounding acquaintances .
[native] i feel i addressed this kind of stuff in the comments i linked , but since you 're on mobile maybe you did n't see them .
[non-native] for example the people who invented televisions which are black and white , on the successful inventing that telivision poeple are more intrested in inventing the colouredtelevisions , hence because of the succesful people mind , they tend to invent more and more things which are more better than the previouinventions .
[native] the audits are an issue , but this is probably due to strict standards of knowing where every single euro is spent than being an overwhelming problem .
[native] the content of the comment is n't the message he wants to get across , it 's that he 's singling out irish people and making fun of us and that 's racist or at the very least , discriminatory .
[native] never-the-less , it was interpreted as letting weaker countries fail under the pretense that they could devalue their currency and become competitive again : not mentioning that nobody would want their new , worthless currency and that it would destabilise the euro as a whole .
[native] do you mean to imply russia would use this to justify a invasion of nato countries ?
[non-native] finally , the implications in the passage would state clearly that , it is not important for a person to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , but its really very good for a person to gain profieciency in one particular subject that helps him inbuilding his career and do better in his job , in all required aspects .
[non-native] maybe drinking a tea in a silent undisturbed atmosphere is great enjoyment for the older , while younger prefer to drink a coke with loud rock music in the background .
[native] we should step up intelligence sharing & perhaps even send in covert special ops teams conducting black ops in support of the ukrainian government .
[native] and selected your supply ships to base ours off so you know money will flow for that .
[native] yes , it needs controlling but in the long run , it 's going to benefit all of us .
[non-native] there are even negative aspects related to the use of cars .
[non-native] when we came to place with that directions , they are very confusing we cant understand any thing .
[non-native] in conclussion , all the possible solutions indicates that a reduction in the number of cars circulating need to take place .
[native] i 'm just talking about what jean-claude juncker is talking about and his stated aim of achieving `` a deal that accepts the specificities of the uk in the eu , while allowing the eurozone to integrate further '' .
[non-native] when all these points are taken into consideration , i can repeat that youngsters enjoy life more than older people do .
[native] edit : hey , do n't downvote the guy .
[non-native] unfortunately , they wo n't helpfull for people who will need them , and the future will limited also for them and others .
[native] the 2.8 % stuff is the beverage of choice for numerous games such as beer pong .
[native] not all of them , maybe not even most of them .
[non-native] if it is not 100 percent sure they do n't do it , because there could be a risk which they do n't want to take .
[native] there 's a lot of chaff being thrown around about the uk not wanting to be in the eu .
[native] the idea is that a poor black encounters more difficulties than a poor white .
[non-native] i think that they would find ways to keep people buying cars .
[native] i think both points stand , aside from some minority groups like arabic christians and kurds , most refugees are safe when they make it into turkey .
[non-native] when i change my glasses color , for example , this would be attractive to my students and colleagues and will make me feel better .
[native] it 'd signify a weak european union , once unable to defend it 's interests & potential allies when faced with russian aggression .
[non-native] there many other activities like going for a dinner with family , which can be easliy managed by having a car .
[non-native] the advertisements just a way to express what they company what to say to the custemer .
[non-native] it 's better to have a specialized knowledge about one subject .
[native] in the states , they do n't really understand this nuance .
[non-native] consequently , both of young people and older people live in this world , but they have different conditions such as energy , wealthy , experience .
[native] essentially , you 're saying that you think that there should be some limits on immigration currently and your reason is not a xenophobic one .
[non-native] on the other hand as a jack of all and master of none kind of person , one can only do a superficial analysis of the problem , as he or she has limited knowledge of the subject .
[non-native] cars however , would not be able to dissapear totally .
[non-native] on the one hand , young people seem to be much more energetic and are certainly physically more vital and attractive .
[native] no , he thinks that that was it 's purpose all along .
[non-native] thus , i conclude that most of young people nowadays give enough time to help thyeir communities .
[non-native] after that i can be known that the times that risks are taken might be the break down of the history , and if you dont take the risk you can not survive .
[non-native] the trouble being that they are barely able to find an agreement on other purpouses such as factory air pollution and water spoiling and chemical pollution so i do not think that they will consider cars like a priority .
[native] we 're trying to be relevant , i guess .
[native] see we 're not so different after all , many of us british types loathe our capital !
[non-native] in regard of statement that affirm that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today , i partially agree .
[native] they are a political organization , not a scientific one .
[native] either being investigated means that they 're most likely corrupt or it does n't - you ca n't have it both ways .
[native] americans can always pick out a canadian , our politeness and accent gives us away .
[native] the views of the city are mixed - the city is keen to escape the heavy and increasing regulatory burden coming from the eu .
[native] like seriously , i 'm slightly fitter than him and even still , i would n't get a naked portrait done .
[non-native] so specialisation secures you a good place in society and in your professional life .
[native] you might not be a nazi , but you 're making a solid effort at it .
[non-native] they can meet many students who have another major , and they know many professor .
[non-native] in this way i feel most advertisements make product seem much better than what they really are .
[non-native] they are an extent area but if he got some information about kinds of caves and how it formed , he will be convinted about what he learns .i agree the idea that most advertisements make products seem much better than really are .

[native] please watch [ this video of testimony before the australian senate on 30 october 2014 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgqo2tsjqky ) which would have been two or three days ago for you , depending on when you read this . . , especially the list of cases senator richard di natale discusses at approximately 17:00 - he explains that the isds provisions stuck into these trade deals , ( isds ) will have effects which in his words `` nobody wants '' he 's questioning the wisdom of this scheme .
[native] they do exist under the energy charter treaty , amongst others .
[non-native] i guess , it is much better and informative to talk to people who have already bought these products to figure out if they are good or not .generally speaking a successful person is someone who succeed in all his attempts , is good in his job and earns a lot of monnaye .
[non-native] as going to museums , listening to concerts , taking a walk on the street , day dreaming , or reading simply for enjoyment are part of their daily activities , they can simply enjoy life for the beauty of its simplicity .i think older people should enjoy life more than young people .
[non-native] consequently , few people nowadays think it is more vital for students to understand ideas and concerts .
[non-native] however , if they understand the original ideas and concepts , they can creat and change those in their own way .
[native] that being said , i think it 's a little too early to call it for the entire century ...
[non-native] in reality , it is the child actor who is holding the toy , who is making it do wonderful things .

[native] we 've always paid through general taxation but now we 're paying the salaries of minister 's buddies as well and their work gym and company cars and it 'll be privatised after that !
[non-native] process is more important than a fact and i will lead you to the result which is a fact .
[non-native] still , some say that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use then there are today .
[non-native] in these circumstances , after close comparision between the learing the facts and understand ideas and concepts , it is not difficult to draw the conclution that it is crucial for students to learn the fact rather than understand ideas and concepts .the product i disappointed at the most was my kichen knife .
[native] new zealand is relatively multicultural , but most of the immigrants here are skilled and not refugees who want welfare .
[non-native] it is not essential to remeber wich specific salt and wich peculiar base are combined ( facts ) , as long as you rember the way the reaction goes and wich is the result ( concept ) .

[non-native] but it was different from the house in the newspaper strongly .
[non-native] obviously , old people can not catch this rapid social pace , it also implies that these great pleasure resulting from works or compete are more and more far away from the old people .
[non-native] in my school , there are many vulenteers help the old men who has no sons and daughters .
[native] it is pronounced bÅ¾ÄÃ¬Å¡ÄÃ¬kieviÄ though , only two consonants in a row
[non-native] in addition , students always get more interests in learning facts than just knowing the definition .
[non-native] so , it would be very wrong on anybody 's part to say that `` young people enjoy more life than older people do '' instead it should be said that '' older people make younger people to enjoy. `` because all the tensions of life are taken by them and the younger people are left free of all problems .success is the fruitful result that a person gets after a job has been accomplished correctly and in the manner it has to be done .

[native] the reaction you 'll get is quite a lot more muted than what you 're probably hoping .
[native] honestly , i feel like you did n't read my posts since i answered why they 're in secret , and it 's not some kind of ` they want to screw the workers ' kind of deal .

[native] but now i 'll just get out of your way so you all can continue being outraged over a few parades a year .

[native] should germany revoke it 's ban on nazi symbols ?
[native] you may be right about the labour vote in the past but i 'll also point out that blair was very popular initially so i think it 's fair to say that he did connect to a lot of the centre-left and centre-right .
[native] and that gold is worth about us$ 1.8 mil total of us$ 6.6 mil yes , that 's some prudent investing .
[native] where our intervention in wwii prevented the iron curtain extending to the channel , where our garrisoning of the fulda gap deterred the soviets from annexing western europe , where the marshall plan helped speed up the post-war recovery of europe & where america 's contribution to nato * ( combined with all the other shit ) * helped provide the stability & foundation needed for pan-european integration to really take off .
[non-native] plus , it actually feels better for us to buy something that has more fancy and nicer advertisement than the ones that are not very commercialized .
[non-native] my personal oinion is differet , in fact a broad knoeledge of many academic subject can help the student to find a job .
[non-native] they will ends with the satisfaction of planning their trip , and seing only what they wanted to .
[native] nope , holland sauce is that weird stuff the brits put on their eggs .
[native] why do n't you take your warmongering bullshit to your own backyard .
[native] canada is a functioning democracy , ukraine is just a shit hole and always has been
[native] well thats three in a row that prove you 're a fucking idiot .
[non-native] this experience is the most impotant element for enjoy life .
[non-native] for example , last year , i came to japan with my friend because we are too crazy on shopping clothers .
[non-native] as a conclusion , i would say that i am convinced that there will indeed be fewer cars in about twenty years , whether it be for economic , political or environmental reasons : the domination of cars has come to an end !i agree completely with this statement .
[native] i 'm sure that the people that resort to tactics like smashing the windows of jewish businesses make sure to do a thorough background check for political allegiances first , right ?
[native] ah well , i suppose that 's at least something .
[non-native] without work , you can not go even more far .
[native] the huge difference in spending ca n't possibly be on wages alone .
[native] that 's * part * of why our sphere of influence is so large : we want customers , and the only way you can be a significant customer is to have a widespread decent standard of living .
[native] yeah , but that was when war was n't nearly as destructive as it is now .
[non-native] men are creative , they allways try to invente new tools to help them in their daily life or to allow them to do new things .
[native] this specific thing - this cultural prevalence of the idea that everyone should prefer death over constant torture - is one of the most horrible and evil things i know of in humanity and i can not describe the amount that i hate it .
[native] so just , uk , germany , france , italy , spain and poland ...
[non-native] we have been killing our very home by overusing cars .
[native] when you 're on the wrong side of the iron curtain you can expect queues , lack of basic supplies , corruption , poverty , etc. . .
[non-native] the regular involvement of the youth in voluntary community service undoubtedly demonstates their enthusiasm and effort in helping their coummunity .
[native] the ` muslim ' category fits 4 to 6 of the 9 categories .
[non-native] nevertheless , i think the reasons that i have presented are stronger .in my oppinion i agree with the idea of understand the ideas and concepts than learn the facts and this is because in order for a student to apply what he has seen in class to real work , is better to understand the concepts and ideas so he can convert to the best for the work .
[non-native] cars have really made are life comfortable and easy going ?
[native] then why do n't italianns who speak standard italian in addition to their own local language ( i.e.
[non-native] for example , if a doctor dont care to understand concepts about the human body , then in future he would be prone towards doing errors .
[native] last time i was in cork was 9 years ago .
[native] it reeks of the most extreme paranoia that he believes , or purports to believe , that the us is directing every bit of the eu 's policy with regard to non-eu member-states like ukraine .
[native] i guess you are excluding the albanian air force flyovers during football matches in foreign countries ?
[native] in addition , hot tourist destinations like orlando do n't really require visitors to interact much with the natives .
[native] its not about who has more planes , its about who runs out first .
[non-native] understand ideas can more helps the students work in their work , only learn facts is not work by doing better , so try to understand what the idea make in you work , and try to understand that , you can feel more helpful from its .in my opinion in twenty years a lot of things may change .
[native] i laugh inside every time i see tourists in budapest walking around in their nationalistic hats and t-shirts they bought without a clue .
[non-native] of course there are several people in the business world with a comparable history .
[native] > please do tell me more about how it is the fault of evil western europe compared to innocent eastern europe .
[non-native] in addition , the socity could lead a person to work and help his country and community and may not ; for example , if a person lives in a generous , freindly , and ready to work together society , he would propably become helpful to his society sooner or later .
[non-native] the importance of learnig facts is something that ca n't be doubted from muy point of view but it is also true that in many case students that just lern notions without understanding the real concepts and ideas that came from these notions are not able to connect this concepts to the real world and to use them to grow up .
[non-native] although it will be much cheaper than going alone the tour might not be as what you have thought .
[non-native] they do not care what is happening in their own community , what are the problems and how to resolve these problems all they want to do is to enjoy they do not realise that there is a problem until they face one themselves .
[non-native] finally , taking all the factors into consideration , we may safely reach the conclusion that the advantages of specializing in one specific subject outweigh those of having broad knowledge of many academic subjects because when we specialize in one specific subject , we have the opportunity to be an expert on that subject and we can be satisfied and successful .most of the young people and old people enjoy their lives .
[non-native] older people might have their own kids and families .
[native] apart from when she was saying that the north want to break away and join roi ` like scotland ' .
[non-native] hence it would be inappropriate to say that `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' .in general it is always difficult to decide definitely for one possibility .
[native] i know that È is pronounced like ` sh ' but how should the rest of the name be pronounced ?
[non-native] today we see that education is more valued as it was before .
[non-native] there are plenty of cities all of over the world saying no to the cars , in italy , just to give you an example , you can use your car depending on the number of you car and on the day .
[native] edit : sorry , looks like i did n't word my first reply correctly .
[native] if a couple can only raise four kids max , then they should not be allowed to implant any more than four embryos .
[native] instead of this full-range fptp bullshit with * all * of a state 's electoral votes going to the state 's overall popular vote winner .
[native] i was merely pointing out that he is too blinded by the german 's need to aggressively expand the eu , that he does n't realise that in doing so , gemans - in their eu frenzy - almost managed to achieve exactly that which the eu was supposed to stop the germans from doing in the first place .
[non-native] companies have to start specifying in order to gain all possible ressources available on the market , for example .
[non-native] and this concept is getting affected from a wide variety of sub factors ranging from governmental policies aiming the country match up with the rest of the world , to easiness to reach information with the help of the technological advances .
[native] however , i do n't think it a question of you suddenly liking us more - after all , we 've not changed , we 're still every bit as annoying as we always have been .
[non-native] therefore , they hardly have time to spend for community activities .
[non-native] an often answer is that olders have more experiments , and had to solve more problems , to reconize each new hapiness moment and enjoy it as it should .
[native] no , the father and the sounds are exactly the same .
[non-native] for that he would have to beat the world champion .
[non-native] studying many academic subjects offers us to have more possibilities .
[non-native] anyway , since we know that issue , and we are so familier with it , we should buy what is good for us .
[native] people are ultimately divided by class etc edit : for what it 's worth i think every spanish autonomous community should have the same rights and be states under a fed government .
[non-native] however , if they would have known , math is need when they have plan to get morgage for thier future house or to calculate the discount of the purchases at the store , it will be motivate to them to learnd math .
[non-native] even sometimes we get loans in order to achieve our desire on this .
[non-native] my second reason why is that is easier to know a little of lot of subjects than have a specialized knowledge about one subject , what i mean with this is that someone specialized in one subject can learn easier a little of lot of subjects than someone who has a broad kwnoledge of lot of subjects .
[native] guess he expected them to be a little more passive and take their lumps like a good little buffer state .
[native] guy fawkes was a terrorist who wanted to make a statement , you ca n't condone what he tried to achieve .
[native] i wonder if there 's one with north america .
[native] > well i think his point was just that the invasion of crimea underscored the idea that the only way to protect your borders is to possess nuclear weapons .
[native] within the un the rights of the people are held higher then the rights of the states .
[non-native] thirdly , many students specifically take time out of there busy schedule to be a part of an old age homes or any protective homes for the special childrens .
[native] at first he was scared because someone was shouting find a canadian lol
[non-native] however , thanks to the new technology , it seems sometimes even not necessary to understand concepts to accomodate in this society .
[non-native] take a risk and you will be successful in life .
[native] that 's the way it 's used here in the us south 4/5 times .
[native] oh please , do you even read the shit you link to ?
[native] meanwhile armenia has already caused a [ ukraine situation in azerbaijan ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nagorno-karabakh_republic ) ( not that i support aliyev 's regime either ) .
[non-native] in fact i think that you will become a successful person only if you do a very active work .
[non-native] to sum up , it is not very wise to believe any advertisements .
[non-native] therefore , rather than doing what other successful people made something , creatively think about tring to make new things that can impact among all of the world , then challenge into the world in order to show how your ability that is possible to be a successful person is existed in the world .i agree , becouse ther ars to many cars we uosed in the contry , when we uous the car there are poloson out of our air , its not good for oure breth .
[non-native] when i was in high school , student just allowed to choose either bussiness or science way .
[non-native] they never look at the other side , this energetic group has to offer .
[native] it 's about $ 11.25 for a normal movie in canada , no fancy sound systems or 3d .
[native] you keep turning up the heat bit by bit , and each time the frog becomes accustomed to the hotter and hotter water .
[native] work is disincentivized when you gain nothing by doing it .
[native] no , but he did forget to mention that he 's fascist .
[native] wow , that is significantly lower than would 've expected .
[native] indians , aussies , saffas , etc can all vote in the uk too .
[non-native] being able to work in a team is a good example .
[native] welp , better stop trusting every comment you read on the internet since apparently anyone could be a shill .
[non-native] i think that people should never stop risking things to become more successful .in this mordern world every person seem to be busy some or the othe way .
[non-native] but , from my experience , it is difficult to find a good personal guide as well as expensive compared with a tour guide .
[non-native] this conceptual belief proves that `` old is gold '' and is very much applicable in the present scenario as each and every individual is aiming for an accurate result in all the fields .
[native] honestly i think the german elite is aggravated as fuck with america right now specifically because of the latter .
[native] meanwhile ucl is a university overwhelmingly based on foreign students , and most of the research team are probably european immgirants , judging by their last names .
[non-native] one can surely expect that many people in the near future will be buying those .
[non-native] these people who have the passion for their work , and the drive to excel in the field , see their enjoyments in the work itself .
[native] i suppose if you have such little faith in international institutions , there 's little i can do to convince you and i doubt we 'd end up agreeing , but just as you find fault with international institutions , so too do investors have trouble trusting national court systems .
[non-native] but what will you do once you are becm successful ?
[native] right , and the nuclear power plants were all temporarily shut down and had comprehensive safety reviews .
[native] they 're not in a military coalition against them ( i can only presume youve been playing too much eu4 ) , nor at war with them .
[non-native] new things means new lives , and also , new risks means new awards .
[non-native] on the other hand , others believe that we have to learn things more specific then we can train the ability of concentrating on things easily .
[native] all these deaths are on his head and his alone .
[native] i think a comparison to the us is the entire point of this post .
[native] ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/partridge/wallpaper/watership_alan_1024.jpg ) and the un says we have a lot of writers .
[native] as a ukip supporter , i really wish nigel would ask them to stop speaking publicly , but i guess we have insufferable idiots in all parties .
[non-native] but if the student is familiar with the concept and understands it fully , he can remember it even many years later .
[native] well , that would be great if , for example , they could get to those countries or if those countries were n't already filled with refugees .
[native] it 's really the logical move if they do leave the eu .
[native] to be honest i do n't see any other countries doing that right now .
[non-native] for example ; my school gives out a lot of homework for one night and it takes me quite a number hours to finish it , and by the time i am done it is time to go to bed , but my mother tells me that in her time they didi not have that many homework so when they finished they had the time to help around in the house or in their neighborhood .
[non-native] i think this was because he got tired faster than i did , or he did n't have much strength so he could n't throw a ball like he used to when he was young .
[native] > but i 'd just like to point out for the sake of the conversation that this is coming from a turk , unless he 's a member of his government , it does n't mean shit whether he government is biased or not .
[native] it 's a very popular tourist destination ( even for nzers ) .
[non-native] the fact that this last proposal would sound ridiculous to anybody highlights the fact that we are all aware of the purpose of an advertisement .
[non-native] i also think that , the word success means risk !
[native] law is complex , and sometimes fundimental rights limit parliament in ways that are not benefical to the country ( such as mental health detention or hate-speech ) .
[non-native] more citys become modernized , more cars are produced to supply increasing demands .
[non-native] i will choose the latter one and list the reasons as follow .
[non-native] they should discover that here are many helps from communities like there are always some people who give help to clean up the trash .
[native] it 's run by a very charismatic man called nigel farage .
[non-native] it is already skyrocketing and it will be more severe in the future .
[non-native] if there is no innovative invent of substitute resource , the number of cars will be decreasing .
[native] always nice to be backed by the stats , cheers !
[native] the only statues who honour german soldiers are of the people who were involved in operation valkyrie ( a plot to assassinate hitler ) and germans on a whole are hesitant to show anywhere near the amount of patriotism that the average american shows .
[non-native] by doing this , they can get the sprit of voluteer and the sprit of helping people .
[non-native] being focused and specialized , workers can gain advantages in their jobs , become more competitive versus peers and colleagues , get more valuable to employers and deliver stronger and higher performances .
[non-native] however , they are made to seem much better than the actual product for several reasons ; to have consumers , to have good reputation for the prodcut , and to earn profit .
[non-native] this situation also brings the necessity of the usage of cars .
[non-native] a key reason underlying my choice is that if we study broadly , we can be more competitive in the future .
[native] our payments to brussels have [ quadrupled ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/31/britain-eu-contribution-rise-quadruple-cameron ) in five years - it 's not just the last bill that annoys people .
[native] also , the baltics and ex-eastern bloc countries are n't bargaining chips to be dealt - they have their own agency and choices to make .
[native] even so , you do n't actually vote for them to be a minister or the pm , they 're appointed as such by their own party .
[native] to leave this to the last moment , instead of during negotiations is just bad taste .
[native] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/race_ ( human_classification ) > race is a social concept used to categorize humans into large and distinct populations or groups by anatomical , cultural , ethnic , genetic , geographical , historical , linguistic , religious , and/or social affiliation .
[native] as someone who just visited croatia and have a pretty decent idea what happened during the war i was amazed at how little you can tell that it only ended 20 years ago .
[non-native] the first reason is that advertisements show only the advantages of the products and ignore the disadvantages .
[non-native] one the main effects , i think , is the relationship between people live in communities .
[non-native] it shows his sense of commitment to a particular task .
[native] listen buddy , it 's black * or * asian .
[non-native] suppose a youth is enrolled in the blood donation community he registers his blood group along with all his detalis .
[non-native] nor will they be able to learn how electricty works .
[non-native] enjoyment is not just going to night clubs or do adventure sports .
[non-native] as aresult , they make perfect advertisement which atrracts the consumers .
[non-native] but i have acquitance with some boys , who really feel the needed to help other people an the communities .
[non-native] traveling is one of the pleasure that is generally at your own discretion .
[non-native] the codes of the nature is being simplified but the humanity is learning that the complexity - as described in physical sciences the enthropy - around us is more than we imagine .
[native] it 's not racist to say , `` muslims are 1/3 of our prison population . ''
[native] i 'm afraid `` as english as an apple pie '' is n't going to take on though .
[native] i 'm saying the idea that putin might annex all of ukraine is highly unlikely .
[non-native] moreover , they can apply the new things and technologies tio their life , which is very important in today 's rapidly growing world .
[native] i was called a ignorant fool stuck in the past for believing that nato countries should either increase military spending to 2 % or eu countries should integrate militarily * ( or both ) * .
[non-native] because you are not alone and the guide has got a program for this day .
[native] i 'm convinced that countries like the netherlands , new zealand , australia , france and germany outrank us .
[non-native] however with your unfinished explanations you could confuse people even more .
[native] i read this more as a flight from depositing in eurozone banks .

[native] 5 years ago , the idea of a sinn fÃ©in government was laughable , but now we 're facing the `` interesting '' prospect of having gerry adams as prime minister just in time for the centenary of the 1916 rising .

[non-native] absolutly , we can use it without understand ideas and concepts but we can not use that those are natually .
[native] children have * grown up * in those camps .
[non-native] first , we tried to follow the tv advertisements to get an idea .
[non-native] so , basically it is important in any school to encourage the students to understand very good the main points of every lesson learned , so the will be able to apply this in a future with their own understanding of the concept the teacher wanted to explain .i totally agree the statment'young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities ' .
[non-native] after that kind of travel , i would not remember anything .
[non-native] in my opinion , this is considerably reasonable taking into account the pollution that cars generate , the congestions and the high number of cars accident .
[non-native] ideas they can apply their own but fact is a fact they ca n't change it anymore after it had happen .
[native] except texas gets federal interstate money to build and maintain good free highways .

[non-native] it is true that to learn facts is the basement for whatever kind of knowledge in every field .
[non-native] lastly , it is very hard to be on top with same things because there are already a bunch of same things in the world .

[native] ) , so it 's stupid to argue that salmond was singled out .
[non-native] you make risk when you want to change to another job because you can get better salary , but who knows that you will be there for a long time , or when you move to another city , it is risky but do not be afraid , you will be fine , the only thing you need is trust in yourself .i agree with the statement , `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' , because if they want to be more successful than they already were , they would try to expand their skills and learn more new things and try to become successful in that , too .
[native] as if the average dumbarse criminal is going to be clever enough to dress up in a burqa .
[native] it 's used much the same way you use the term `` administration '' in the us .
[non-native] i think that we are paying more attention at this topic in this year than in the past .
[non-native] i think the best to do , when you are a successful people , is to try new things but taking the less risks as possible ; indeed , even if you are successful one time , may be next time you wo n't and you will loose everything .
[non-native] on reason for this is that people change the towns thez are living in quite often .
[non-native] now they attempted wrong and next time they rectify their mistake and able to remember the answer correct and these students score good marks .
[non-native] all in all , the whole world is turning over the successful persons hands , and if you tried to look up their most attracted works they tried the new , they take the risk .the world toll us through the history that is very important for students to understand ideas and concepts , but more important is to learn facts .
[non-native] for this reason , companies start looking more for specialists on a specific subject rather than looking for people with broad knownledge .
[native] that leaves us open to fluctuations in your market and your policies .
[non-native] so impetus at a time wo n't make them make wrong decisons will cost billions of money .

[non-native] second at all the more specialized a person - in this example a doctor - becomes the more likely it will be that he is only neeeded for a small number of duties , investigations or treatments , wich in my oppinion leads to more perfectionism at first , but very easily leads to a lack of compassion and boredom soon afterwards , leaving behind a specialist with no enthusiasm and compassion any more for his job and profession .
[native] wait , there was 1848 , and post-ww2 communism ?
[non-native] when one is young , he has lots of responsibilities , such as exams or decisions for the rest of his life .
[non-native] plus , students who have an understanding of the matter can answer questions more easily , and are even able to answer questions that go beyond the mere facts .

[native] have ukip even stated policy on eu migrants currently living in the uk were we to leave the eu ?
[non-native] to conclude , it is true that in some ways concepts and ideas outways the facts but the their worth can not be reduced to minimal because facts needed to strengthen the concept and idea .
[native] a question the palestinians have been facing for decades regarding israel .
[native] tl ; dr king james wanted to end the catholic-protestant divide without persecution or violence , but by trying to convert catholics to protestants , which , if refused , would just result in ignoring them ( providing they did n't do anything violent ) .

[non-native] in that way you will learn everything you have to know about economics .
[non-native] since there is increasing competition between companies in all sectors of business .
[non-native] but not for someone who tells them he knows everything , but only to quite small extents .
[non-native] imagine a freshman majoring physics with a selection of english literature in hand all day around , will he succeed in his field someday ?
[non-native] a man should have a wide knowledge of many subjects because the world needs him to do so .

[native] i 'm a little shocked that france and germany are so high .
[native] europe 's carrot of possible eu membership might 've helped create this crisis , but it 's americans who have had the leadership role forced on us a number of times because of eu incompetence & divisions in your membership .
[non-native] for example a product , lets say a mobile phone .
[non-native] wright brothers saw a bird flying in the air and he thought that why can not a similar structure be made and make it fly in the air using two wings and a tail .

[native] because sweden would n't be able to control how the money is spent and that it 's actually spent on refugees .
[non-native] for example , the fizz drinks consumed by almost all in the world .
[non-native] in conclusion , we should never stop trying new things in our lives .
[non-native] while young people are rather busy in material life fighting for better standard of living , better education etc.older people have done struggle in their life and might getting pension through goverment or from the company they have workcommunity ?

[non-native] for instance , when i visit a certain place that i may want to spend more time .
[non-native] i personally prefer to travel without a group and definately to travel without a tour guide .
[non-native] i think that you need more than this statment .
[non-native] first of all , successful people have a lot of direct experience .
[non-native] this will help the students to understand why it is important fot them to study hard and gain more knowlege in certain areas .
[native] the more the issue is debated the more the polls show us favoring to stay in .
[non-native] only a stupid person can take some big risks without the possibility to get some bigs benefits .

[non-native] environment problem has been issued by internation society such as un and international enviroment organiztion such as wto .
[native] yup - but it is true that the eca have found issues with the budget .
[native] the overall effect on the cost of living is that some things may become more expensive because they lose desperation as a means to underpay their workers , while other areas become less expensive because you see more people taking the risk of working in those areas instead of taking a less attractive job which they 're more likely to be able to hold .
[non-native] then this question comes to my mind , which enjoy life more , young people or older people ?
[native] it is not going to work for all of them .
[native] i would n't say it 's tiny if you 're including all the satellite suburbs on its outskirts .
[native] we lost a war because our weather was bad once , even though we had the support of napoleon bonapart .
[non-native] so , i probably conclude my opinion by mentioning that risks should be taken by people in their lives which leads to succesfull person in their career .
[non-native] it is very important to develop this knowledge in order not to be narrow-minded .
[non-native] but they just talked about the photographer is mistook to make the catalogue .
[native] kinda worth noting that no 100 megaton bombs have ever existed though .
[non-native] moreover we can consider that cars have become a symbol other than a mean of transportation in the last years , especially for some wealthy societies .
[native] certain newspapers would be foaming at the mouth screaming `` think of the children '' the rest of us would probably not even notice .
[non-native] although now im needed to follow taking core subject , but i have hope for the semister b by thinking of taking the subject i like .
[native] look mate , i trust the canadian and australian health departments ( bodies of experts whose job it is to determine the danger from such chemicals ) considerably more than i trust your selective reading of the facts .
[non-native] some people believe that having a variety of knowledge about a range of academic subject is better than to master only one acadmic subject .
[non-native] even to understand our own interests and strengths before specializing in any particular subject we need to diversify us into various academic or real life experiences and sometimes by even failing in few ventures where we are not strong .
[non-native] along with these i 'll come across specialized subjects in computers after two years .
[non-native] however , it does not mean that not doing these kind of activities makes the older one enjoy the life less the younger one .
[non-native] finding an alternative to cars as transportation vehicles may decrease the problems of air pollution and parking place .
[native] which , again , completely shoots down your argument .
[native] but the fact that distribution is not equal just reflects the preferences of the public .
[native] for that matter , greenland is not european ( despite being controlled by denmark ) .
[non-native] but here we give impotance mainly to the ideas and concepts rather than learning the facts this facts would only help us to complete the device quickly .

[non-native] i hope young people study hard .people come to life once so they might as well enjoy it as they live it .
[non-native] we can observe some sort of grip and confidence in people who specialized .
[native] > you seriously tip them a dollar for every beer ?
[native] did you read the myths & legends we teach in school ?
[native] particularly turkey who has accepted millions of syrian refugees , and jordan , who has been accepting immigrants from their neighbouring countries since the proclamation of israel .
[native] and that 's the point of having the specific mandate , otherwise politicans may directly use monitary policy to achieve fiscal objectives .
[non-native] personally , during the week i am always busy because of the university and the work , and during the weekend i usually enjoy with my friends and unfortunatly , this kind of life is similar to all my friends lifes and the main part of young people lifes .
[non-native] the result of this course was that all of the students were n't able to solve a case studies and were n't able to solve a real problem .
[native] several possible reasons exist for such permanent losses of output and growth .
[non-native] from the reasons i mentioned above , we can safty draw a conclusion tha there will be fewer cars in use in many years .
[non-native] in the academic life in universities , every student wishing to graduate from the university must represent a specific subject as finishing project .
[non-native] the freedom to create a schedule according to my preferences and to choose who to interact and socialize with during my vacation offsets the extra organizational effort prior to the trip .
[native] i really like irish too , but i still think rp is the gold standard of english .
[native] libel was an example i chose because could involve , well , tit for tat .

[native] > it will consist of bullying russia , opportunistic china and the other up-and-comers .
[native] because the government in israel is fundamentally no different to the government in gaza .
[native] not necessarily a sensible development or a desirable one , but a pretty natural one .
[native] they just dislike it because they feel the eu takes enough money as it is and does n't do much good with it .

[non-native] second of all , when we read a textbook , you will soon find out that it says a lot of the concepts of the facts .
[native] i 'm not saying that applies to all americans , just american culture .
[non-native] there are people that affirm that in the future there will be not more cars respect to today ; instead , there are other people that think that cars will continue to be used even in the future .
[native] russia is best place to live , uncle pooty protects all true russians and filthy west cant harm you when in russian land , especially land that is rightfully and historically russian , currently occupied by fascist nazis but that isnt big deal .
[native] though , the left/right concept that you speak of will be obsolete within the coming years .
[non-native] i also became a member of many subcommunities like toefl ibt , ms spring 2007 , visa online .
[non-native] firstly , it is generally agreed that new things can strongly appeal to people .
[non-native] first of all , in order to rely on some facts there must be generated some ideas and concepts .
[non-native] the concept of car will never disappear because people need their independance , they need to feel free to go where ever they feel like and on their own .
[non-native] first example of this is that young people nowadays do not join events that are held by support of communities such as festivals and community meetings .

[native] slovakia ( from a bratislava perspective ) : people from zÃ¡horie region ( north of bratislava near the border with cz ) are considered to be simple-minded idiots without any education , the region is the butt of many common jokes people who live in the far east of the country ( especially if they 're east of koÅ¡ice ) do nothing but drink , and nobody lives there anymore besides grandmothers and grandfathers because all the young people have moved to blava , prague or the uk
[non-native] the first solutions should focus in reducing the use of fossil fuels .
[native] russia and the soviets have been doing this for decades , they 're not stupid enough to actually do it over foreign airspace , which is indicative of an actual attack .
[native] as somebody who is environmentally conscious , i support water charges in theory .
[non-native] to conclude , i think that the ability to enjoy life is not directly linked with your age .
[non-native] third , the last factor that the advertisement make product seem much better is to be popular around the world .
[non-native] as far as i am concerned , i prefer to study broad knowledge of many academic subjuects .
[non-native] whereas in the united states , each class is assigned to a specific number of credits , during your first two years of college you are able to choose within the large catalog of classes as long as you get a enough credits to validate your academic year .
[native] if they say that they 're journalists , what do we do then ?
[native] it 's also worth noting that european football or `` soccer '' is actually becoming quite popular here .
[non-native] i think most of successful people are very self confident people , and that 's why they 're stronger than the others , because if they fall , they can also rebuild what has been destroyed .
[native] for me ; germany , france , belgium , austria or netherlands .
[non-native] it would also lead to harsher climatic conditions and hence pedestrians and two wheeler drivers would have no other option then to move to much safer options such as cars where utilities such as airconditioner would be able to keep the air healthier and maintain a proper temperature .
[native] all our stats are pretty much better than all the european countries with a few exceptions , we earn more ( beaten by norway and switzerland ) , live longer ( except for norway ) , more of us are tertiary educated , our economic growth is better , our social cohesion is fantastic , our government debt is laughably small in comparison , we achieve better in school with higher pisa ranks ( except for finland , vittun suomalaiset !
[native] without looking it up it 's about $ 1.30 to # 1 .
[native] i would n't trust any financial institution with it myself in that situation .
[non-native] therefore , they take different tastes from life and therefore , young people enjoy life more than older people do .young people young blood young acts more adventures more fun .
[non-native] my daily experence is a good example of this , i went to ski last month in vancouver .
[native] in their first paragraph they complain about parallel justice systems , ignoring that all eu countries are part of the ehcr , icj , and the wto dsm , let alone others and the world has n't ended .
[non-native] as the student is more interested in particular subject he can make use of time by learning more about his particluar subject .
[native] countries such as china and saudi arabia act far worse .

[non-native] the desire to be succesful makes people find out different ways to reach their goal that some prefer taking risks and trying to find out what kind of things would be prefferable in order to make more money , taking different kinds of self improvement courses or self conciousness courses .
[non-native] there are a lot of artists , painters , musicians , dancers who already know a particular skill or have a specific talent and they dwell on it , improve it , specialize in it and become successful .
[native] forcing them to act like they are is disingenuous and a recipe for disaster .
[non-native] for these reasons , i think a group travel with a guide is not the best way to travel .
[native] it 's similar to japan , which declared that everybody needs to get a surname after the nobility was semi-abolished ( basically stripped of all powers except in a little house of lords-inspired parliament ) in the meiji restoration .
[native] you can indeed - and they 're often 0.5 l not 0.33 l !
[native] > towards political extremes wanting the uk to leave the eu is not a political extreme .
[native] conventional war with the russians makes the use of tactical nukes very possible & severely increases the chance of global thermonuclear warfare .
[native] it 's got a business centre , government buildings , hotels , universities , theatres and auditoriums , museums , an airport , traffic , and everything else you 'd normally find in a city .
[native] regardless , that only allows them to sue and does n't necessarily mean they 'll win , and they can only sue for money - they ca n't change laws or anything like that .
[native] the article is claiming evidence that countries who did not persue stimulus are doing better than those who did , dispite inital differing circumstances .
[native] do you like people pressing against you in crowds ?
[native] it is tied to your culture , and when the majority of most european countries populations are still christian , then the religious aspect plays a major part in forming their identities .
[non-native] for example coming to the orkut online access community , i am a memeber of it .
[non-native] incontrast , many facts and things that we belive that they are true , they become questionable and adoubtable .

[native] they throw a parade and then leave on bad terms .
[native] i 've just never heard of the stagnation before and wanted to read up on it not going to debate it though , too much effort on something that could change rapidly with a major event ( war , leaving the eu etc. )
[non-native] a few days ago , we gathered to see and talked about many things .

[non-native] as long as it is constructive in building his character he is happy .
[non-native] in addition they had to take risks in order to get to achive their goals and dreams .

[non-native] i went back to see the doctor , spoke about it , got that medicine prescribed to mother and now she has much better relief .
[native] in these uncertain times , people are vulnerable to mass produced propaganda and publicity stunts ... spain certainly has a lot to fear from catalonia bailing on them .
[native] free mixing of the sexes , if i had to guess .
[non-native] however , others think that youngers , these days , do not have enough time to accomodating the communities they are living .
[non-native] clearly , the logical way to learn is facts then concepts .
[non-native] there is no reason cause comany to cheat its customers .
[native] that was the first example i could think of others `` not respecting their commitments '' , like you said .
[non-native] thus in this case it is not difficult to be the best .
[non-native] in france , when you enter university you have to choose a section , for example if i want to major in english , i wo n't be able to add psychology as a minor .
[native] could you please provide a link for this interview ?
[native] go watch some russian roulette dispatches from vice , unless you think they are paying these people to lie .
[native] i genuinely feel less and less british with each passing day .
[non-native] the producers should think less to the sales than to the wealth of the people that will buy the product for example , if the product is food .
[native] this is the kind of thing that fucks people off , not free movement of people willing to work .
[native] maybe because the irish pound to euro exchange rate was the closest of all the countries , 0.79 : 1 .
[non-native] they like to drive expensive cars and enjoy the attention on them .
[native] i do n't think it 's wrong to say they did when they requested nato membership .
[native] the german ancestry in me agrees , but i assume that they nail down the boards as they go , which would make it a hell of a lot safer .
[non-native] but when he has established a new product or a new selling method he is the only one having this advantage .
[non-native] he spends all the weekeds , every saturday night working for the community .
[native] that 's kind of the loophole that sweden is operating under and it has been made clear that no countries , other than sweden , can operate under such loop holes again .
[native] you could always try persuading her majesty 's government to institute the free movement between us .
[native] companies are inherently amoral , so good luck with that .
[non-native] the first thing is to put the nicest product at the entrance of the store .
[non-native] besides , specialists in urbanism in many major cities such as new york , paris etc have developed the network of these structures so that always more people can use them .
[non-native] therefore you can observe many people doing some crazy things while othere simply watching them and stilla making enjoyment in their life .
[non-native] for example , when i was watching braum 's milk advertisement , it does n't really change my mind from not buying to buying their product but when i went to the braum 's and look up their product 's nutridition sign and others , it really makes me their product is a good and healthy for me .
[non-native] abouv all , young peoplemost people are about to do what they already know how to do well , or follwo what other people did .
[non-native] i heard about a special new agency that proposes special part time jobs for old people who want to share their knowledges and their experiences with young executives within a company .
[native] whether eu migration will be a net positive in the longer term remains to be seen .
[native] more retail parks in the suburbs , better bus services , lower crime rates .
[non-native] whatever occupation it is valualbe to understand ideas and concepts .
[non-native] if she do not know anything about that she/he can not realise the facts .
[non-native] take me as an example , i am teaching pharmacy students in a jordanian university , i keep getting newer information from different books and resources and include it in my lectures .
[non-native] the way people travelled , dressed has been continiously changed over years .
[native] all i 'm saying is that when i a whole population is uncomfortable around you just because of something you 're born with ... well it 's fucking shit ... :(
[non-native] always , people who wants to study well , they should enjoy it and understanding concepts and ideas helps them to be like that .
[native] as a capitalist i find the nonsense spouted by many about the soviet union 's downfall as insulting.the cause is not even mentioned once by the vast majority of these people .
[non-native] it is evident that if we do n't take any risks , we can not have any potential in success .
[non-native] so our choice was nothing but a random one .
[non-native] because young people have not know various things in the society yet , they can experience new things everyday .
[native] it may come as a shock to a citizen of a country unaffected by war , but under the above conditions ** nowhere ** is an economically sustainable country , and to take a stance that we should not recognise a state as a result of that plays directly into israel 's hands .
[non-native] therefore , we can save not only time but also money by using public traffic .
[native] or italy prior to it being united under nationalism of garibaldi ?
[native] australia is gon na look for a very close alliance with a country soon .
[non-native] they want to learn new things and they will success too if they have interest .

[native] you have any idea the war crimes being committed by the japanese ?
[non-native] you can go out with friends and meet new people by travelling .
[non-native] also , changing the routine of life is of big importance .
[native] while inflation sitting at ~ 2 % has slowly erroded standards of living ; my concern is that house prices may outstrip wage growth and put pressure on disposable income .
[non-native] advertisements always are used to express some special needings to the person who whatches them .
[native] right , so the effect is indirect rather than legislated against ?
[non-native] the governments can solve the problem working on decreasing the number of the cars and increasing the number of the public transportation vehicles .i agree to the statement that in twenty years tere will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
[non-native] another aspect related to this is the fact that petrol will not be available forever .
[native] capital , ideas and goods can already do this but the free movement of labor ( people ) lags far behind and is commonly cited as one of the reasons there still exists such a large divide between the `` rich '' and `` poor '' world .
[native] this is such a disappointing outcome ; why do such parties refuse to use their criticism constructively ?
[non-native] that is why , people will have to use their own car .
[non-native] taking risks by planning cunningly and regardingly what you already know how to do well is the recipe to the elixir .
[native] dear god , sometimes i do n't know if i 'm dealing with doomsayers , apologists or the ignorant .
[non-native] therefore , there is no inferiority in traveling alone to traveling in tours .
[non-native] he or she might be likely to support his or her point .
[non-native] based on my experience , tour guides have to the potential to limit the personal freedom to visit attractions that i wanted to see and group dynamics can have a negative impact on all members of the travel group .
[native] the uk will continue to have high levels of immigration and emigration once we have left the eu .
[non-native] it is beacase he does not know about the realities .
[native] as i recall , the reviews did n't recomment the immediate shut down of any nuclear power plants , yet the german government decided to shut down eight of them .
[non-native] it can decide use their request time , go someplace directly , and can carry many things .
[native] the per worker contribution must therefore be extremely low ( which is not surprising given that most eea migrants are in low-pay , low-value added jobs ) .
[non-native] so , young people should enjoy their life to maximum extent as they can not enjoy when they are old .i disagree about this question for the following two reasons .
[native] so you do n't think they should be compensated for the opportunity cost ?
[non-native] because he have various knowldege it was easy to have a conversation with others .
[native] serious organisations have tried to quantify the economic effect and virtually all come out as a marginal positive or a marginal negative .
[non-native] on the other hand some prefer to do the things they have a know-how and try to make them better in this thing which they beleive they will reach their goal .
[non-native] the familiar in one subject make theman a scientist .
[native] it is a challenge that applies to everywhere not just ireland .
[non-native] i think it is because they do not get any idea from math .
[non-native] the movie , `` the day after tomorrow '' has made real sense in showing what would be the state of the world in sometime from now .
[non-native] the fashion newspapers are one of the specialists in this matter .
[non-native] still now , about the country i visited with group , i have much information .
[native] i get that you are trying to disparage the us and the waiters who work at shitty restaurants , but nobody sees being a waiter as a career unless you are at a top-flight restaurant or a restaurant manager .
[native] i abhor the french `` surrender '' jokes as for anyone who has studied history , france has possibly the most impressive military history of any nation barring ww2 .
[native] i 'll give you that the current abbot government has stepped further to the right than any recent federal government in australia 's history , but they still much more closely resemble the democrats than anything else in america , our centre is still to the right of the ( usa ) democrats pretty much everyone would say .
[non-native] in my openion they have the right to make products seems much better than the really are .that 's surely a good issue .
[non-native] if the seller is able to advertisement his product in the way that the consumer want is target is reached .
[non-native] but its also better to have an indepth knowledge of a particular subject , one can be a master of a particular topic as that is going to help oneself professionally .
[native] `` he used to spend a lot of time in the basement , but we did n't think it was too unusual . ''
[non-native] for example , some young scientist may invent a machine which can efficiently remove hazardous materials from water in lesser cost .
[non-native] in our daily life the ideas and concepts are more preferable when compared to learn facts .
[native] it 's influence considering it 's population and ultranationalist tendencies , never mind corruption and history as a belligerent , would be overwhelming .
[native] it was done deliberately to prevent the diaspora from voting .
[native] so in the case of the extremes , cyrus has been underpaying the eu by $ 47.75 per person , whereas luxembourg has been over paying by $ 167.71 per capita .
[native] ( referring to russia and their little bro ) ah the comments on that video page .
[non-native] the sound that he is making when he takes a sip from the bottle and after he is done the way he talks or stands - feeling of relief - makes a big difference .
[native] instability in ukraine as well as poor relationships with other nations has made it easy for russia to snatch crimea , for the advantage of russia .
[non-native] and a lot of peaple try to do exactly the same .
[non-native] secondly , if you do not want to be interupted by others , travelling alone may be better choice .
[non-native] when the first time i went to japan , i went alone .
[native] in fact , the party that tried to get the law through had had strong historical links with the domestic companies competing with ethyl corp.
[native] it ended up closer to 800 million and even at that price it leaked after it was finished .
[native] check out the wiki article on it : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/african_american a term spanning hundreds of years , involving all kinds of cultural and historical significance .
[non-native] the people we today see enjoying corporate success , political success or even as movie stars have one thing in common .
[non-native] in sum , having broad knowledge of many academic subjects has disadvantages and specializing in one specific subject has advantages .
[native] whether they were `` righteous wars '' he undertook you can debate , but he certainly was responsible for many deaths in his own lifetime .
[non-native] futhermore the public transport is limited on which he ca n't rely upon for evereything .
[non-native] after years of learn to facts , albert got a conclusion of an important theory , and one day einstein won the nobel 's award .
[non-native] and this business is going to stay lucrative for a long time .
[non-native] this is really important point about how they think about trying new things .
[native] ironically at least one us civil war battle actually took place in france , [ just outside the port of cherbourg ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_cherbourg_ ( 1864 ) )
[native] providing ttip covers those areas , isds provisions would mean that european companies would have considerably more access to the us markets , greatly increasing the european economy .
[non-native] having many background infomantion can help many bad or good circumstances .
[non-native] as a customer , we have the choice to buy the item or not .
[native] true and that 's a factor i did not consider but the american chap up there and his post makes it seem like the eu states are sharpening sticks in comparison to the great danger that is russia .
[native] which is why i want you to quote stuff , so i do n't waste my fucking time again in the future having to disprove the copious amounts of shit you post .
[non-native] they care only for colecting money from them , but the people it dos n't matter if they will go to the hill .
[non-native] because the society is improving , people start to care old people more .
[non-native] first , they say that older people generally have more money than young people , therefore they have more chance for enjoying life by using this money .
[native] the uk does n't have a currency or oil issue with the eu , for instance .
[native] not sure where it came from , but i have warm fuzzy irrational feelings about you all .
[non-native] therefore the risks at the beginning of his career have paid out very well .
[non-native] however , there is a good news that people around the world start to care about this serious issue , and start to try to reduse the damage from people daily activities .
[native] of the 80,000 to emigrate in the previous year more than 4/5 had a job and were not unemployed when leaving , ~ 30,000 were college graduates ( thats just a small bit more than the 26,000 who were emigrating every year before the recession to travel , work etc ) and ~ 60 ' 000 people moved to ireland .
[native] i have personally helped the government bust a guy who was getting 3 welfare cheques to his house under different names , and this guy was there alone after only 2 months .
[native] they can suffer fines and penalties if they do .
[non-native] third , traveling a gourp with a tour guide is much more safer than traveling alone .
[non-native] in fact , cars have been discussed already and are changing as i am writing .
[non-native] actually , the youth is the time to enjoy and make merry , but today 's generation seems to misinterpret it .
[non-native] eminent people world over are being recognised for thier meritorious work in a particular field and not for their works in different fields .
[non-native] and poeple actually thinks they needs a car for some reason .
[native] that i consider dishonest , to attribute relative peace to everything the modern incarnation does rather than to what the old one did with a fraction of the influence .
[non-native] second , if i cam explore by myself , it is bigger chance to get some unexpected experience such as seeing famous people there , or getting paticular foods in the area .
[non-native] this led many theories in physics and later scientists created wonders with this concept .
[non-native] finally , i would say that tarveleing alon is not good thing .
[non-native] but when an individual has got a personal car than he or she can go to any beautiful corners of the nature .
[native] well on the bright side , poland is the only thing that made fascists and communists work to together , rather then just kill each other .
[native] this was not 60 minutes reporting that ireland uses the pound .
[non-native] even though from this point of view it seems very usefull to gather a broad knowledge it also brings with it some problems .
[native] just like our food , cigarettes have been pumped full of additives and preservatives that are far more harmful for your health than tobacco .
[native] i notice their own site has cut that video to just the first 2:30 , i.e.
[non-native] many old people have deseases that rob from them thier health and make them disapair .
[non-native] even career opporutunities would be good for the student who has specialization .
[native] even in glasgow , it seems that sectarianism is on the decline .
[native] ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arithmetic_mean ) > and there is no other source of income in my household ( i am still single ) .
[non-native] people using a lot of ideas to creative the things what they want .
[non-native] they had to admit the problems because they were unable to deliver the aircrafts in time .
[native] u/john _ wilkes was responding to a poster who indicated that eusceptics do n't have a clue how international economics works .
[non-native] most companies would use a lot of money to decorate their products and advertising becasue they want to catch the buyers ' attention .
[non-native] i 'm actually currently taking course simmier as the first year of university students should study .
[native] in my mind there are two big differences to note : ( 1 ) the attitude of the british public to the eu is different from the attitude of the dutch public to the eu .
[non-native] after that , people may really specialize in their subject .
[native] i do n't think he wants to take the take us out of the eu , but he 'd do it just to save face .
[native] i had a video ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5ncuq9agqq ) that had great analysis of poroshenko before the election but it got taken down recently .
[non-native] in particular , the advertisement highlits only the good things about a certain product while the negative parts remain hidden and you discover them only when you effectively have the chanche to use the product in your house .
[non-native] you may be able analize even different situation following the same concept .
[non-native] therefore , we have to widen our mind and reopen it to other areas and make some differents friends and maybe sometimes they can give us other aspects ideas .
[native] also , if getting a job disqualifies people from certain benefits ( employment insurance , etc. . . ) , often people end up in a situation where getting a job actually leaves them worse off .
[native] they 've also been told that three million jobs would go and world war 3 would break out if we left it .
[native] perhaps , but to be honest , the eu was set up with this in mind .
[native] we need to be forward thinkers like north korea and end all this nonsense of buying things off foreign companies .
[non-native] in my opinion , the current situation is bad enough to compell society to offer alternative solutions to this problem which will result in the decrease of the number of cars .
[non-native] as a result , the cars will become less used than today .
[native] you would be better able to understand all perspectives and understand how and why people act , and how they will likely act given a set of circumstances .
[native] ddcno1 explained the german situation pretty well , and i think austria is one of the countries in which street view will be accessible soon ( the other eu countries with no coverage are greece , slovenia , malta , luxembourg and cyprus ) .
[non-native] and i believe that the fact that we take art history couses in the school make us more important engineer than the ordinary engineer since he would desing the internet sites more interesting and more exciting .
[non-native] sometimes , to achieve this fake objects are used .
[non-native] all the days we find many people like that .
[native] nato in turn , knows that the russian show of force is mostly show and it should not overreact in any manner that may tip actual capabilities , which in turn allows nato to assess the performance of each of their members in actual confrontations , though low-level as they may be .
[non-native] even though we can not think of our lives without cars in theseday , our children or grand children will think it 's oon the history of modern civilizations the question of having broader or specialized knowledge has produced many conflicts .
[native] it 's actually pretty sad how utterly demonized immigrants are on the internet .
[native] the surface looks like it has powder on it but the general shape screams `` big rock ''
[non-native] after all , success is just not only earning much money , but also makes others live comfortably .
[non-native] a man has to face problems if he doesnot have a car .
[native] lastly , i think the fact that you 've been reduced to insulting me and the people who agree with me displays the bankruptcy of your own horrendously illogical position .
[native] > also : `` denying them the ability to control their air space '' is not remotely the same thing as `` choosing not to fly there '' > that 's the mechanism : by saying the air space is still in ukrainian control , they prevent a great number of planes from flying there .
[native] if he stops at crime people will forget in about 2 years and more or less go back to normal .
[native] the reporting in `` real news '' even is quite unbiased except when it touches territorial disputes .
[native] if you think that russia would actually attack a nato presence i 've got a lambda sign with a 3 next to it to sell you .
[non-native] it becomes difficult to pass even a single day away from your car when it may be having its share of time with the mechanic , and you feel handicapped .
[native] the european union has * always * been comparable , and economically bigger , than the united states as a whole .
[native] it just so happens that it favours men * more often * than women , but both are constrained nonetheless .
[non-native] this started making some scientists to think of macking hay while the sun shines by building flying cars which could have special air tracks and traffic signals which will stop the traffic jam .
[non-native] for them everyday is a new one , they are n't boried accumulating problems , their owne are essentialy about their boy or girlfriends . ..
[non-native] but , as i said before , this pattern can not be generalized to whole lot of younger generation .
[non-native] for example , when i was a high school student , i would attend the experiment of sience class in laboratory .
[non-native] nevertheless , the specialization is - i think - also very important .
[native] it happened in quebec in 1995 , where a lot of voters got cold feet once they stepped into the voting booth .
[non-native] for example , cars , computers and many automated machines .
[non-native] moreover , companies want to employ specialist , because they are often confronted with very difficult tasks , which can only solved by an expert .
[non-native] the people who were uniqe in their own mojors cought the success by the diffence .
[native] many of these refugees hold views which can be considered right wing , even far right in europe .
[native] but it has overwhelmingly exposed only the uk working classes to competitive labour markets .
[non-native] nonetheless i think it is better to specialize in one specific subject .
[native] there are some idiots who mentally think that a woman would never hurt someone and all that other shit .
[native] and once you 've done that , turn it into a haiku !
[native] the polish soviet war was one of the worst defeats ever for the red army , up there with the loss to japan earlier in the century .
[native] - self centered with a sense of cultural superiority .
[non-native] but some of them think that if they try new stuff maybe they will probably lose lots of stuff from what they usually have .
[native] note , when they burnt cameron the also burnt the plaice of westminster .
[non-native] while the students are doing that , they get more experiences and know what to do next time .
[non-native] sometimes if you dont take risks you can not survive .
[non-native] when one feels having made an accomplishment in any field , he/she starts ` enjoying ' it .
[native] we can buy tickets in advance , it is the only way to get seats for imax for big movies , but you should still arrive in advance to get good seats .
[non-native] i believe that humans are easily convinced by what is good , but more easily drawn away by what is bad for them .
[native] compared to iceland which actually reduced public and most importantly private debt through devaluation of their currency ireland it 's not doing at all well .
[native] eh , i wrote about the ttip [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2jsqfv/what_is_so_great_about_ttip/clerlxy ) and [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2ewgn3/lets_have_a_discussion_about_the_ttip/ ) .
[native] i just meant that , for example , moscow and st. petersburg should probably stay in the same country .
[native] whether it 's accurate or not is n't as important as understanding that that image is what goes through israelis ' minds when they consider what might happen if the arabs win .
[non-native] on the other hand , taking risks could lead to the loss of success that one person has achieved before .
[native] i do n't understand why people want to keep a part of their country which does n't want to be part of their country .
[non-native] as i mentioned before modern society is too complex .
[non-native] furthermore , i think that traveling alone is quite a good experience .in our society , we can see that many successful people who are succeed with the coming of new things .
[non-native] we know that the gudie is professional and gets good training about the resorts that we visit .
[non-native] so it can be really dangerous for you to try new things and take risks rather than only doing what you know how to do well .
[native] sorry for having a sentimental attachment to the motherland ?
[native] irish independence may may be too far past in european history but is still a major part of the irish identity considering how long ireland was under british rule and the attempted cultural genocide only served to strengthen irish nationalism which is arguably enforced by the irish education system .
[native] my history teacher when i was in secondary school once said `` there was a time when the average western history student knew more about leon trotsky than the average russian history student '' .
[non-native] student need to study facts ; in this way they can face and compare the differences between the notions they learned .
[native] if their own national department reports had said that there was a danger , it would have been fine .
[native] i think the angloshpere is much closer than scandinavia culturally and mentally .
[native] look at canada and see your future if you depend to much on the usa .
[native] all that aside , at least you guys are mostly keeping up with the 2 % baseline for nato members , which ca n't be said for most of the rest .
[non-native] although that question was more difficult , i understood the way of solution so i could do it .
[non-native] so maybe the mentioned ideal is easier to reach by not forgetting knowledge than by gathering it .
[native] well , the us * bought * guantanamo from cuba about a century ago .
[native] if i 'm not lucid enough to desire continued survival , then they should keep me alive until i am .
[native] it worked well in the us because the fed took a `` take no prisoners '' approach to qe , and pumped in hundreds of billions of dollars and threatened to do it as long as necessary until things turned around .
[native] a few days after being in germany i was desperate for a nice ale .
[native] i simply use cookie auto-destruct and tor , so each time i visit google google will think i 'm a new person .
[non-native] consequently , we can see , in twenty years , the cars will probably be less used than there are today .
[non-native] i think some ads show the product for people oppisite of what they are for two reasons first they shoe all good stuuf in the product and they dont mention the bad things and secound some times they used some lies to sell their products .
[non-native] for instance , if they want to attract young people the advertisement company will use a model who is popular , like a famous soccer player or a politician who wil of course try to impress and catch the eyes of the viewers by wearing '' nike shoes '' .
[native] as for people ` losing their soverenignty ' through imf/eu funding .
[native] i was making a joke that the figures ( the numbers themselves ) are in front for russia on the map .
[native] but the power of the minority party in the senate is much stronger than in the house of representatives .
[native] get your head out of your ass and stop engaging conversation like a 4 year old .
[non-native] that is what is needed to achieve acceptable social standards that everyone wants to reach .
[non-native] as a resultes , they add many untrue information about thier products in order to convince the buyer to purchase from them and not from other companies .
[non-native] but most of the successful people are ready to take this risk and most of them are suceesful in their plans .
[non-native] in fact i imagine my self travelling around the world , surching for new experiences , and new sources to organise very original a particular events here in italy .
[non-native] if a person has a car of his own , he does n't have to rely on the public transport such as buses , trains , trucks , aeroplanes etc .
[native] the fact that you think i 'm an american shill makes you pretty worthy of the tin-hattery accusations , i must say .
[non-native] thus , improved infrastucture is not only an indicator of the trend that more people are going to invest in cars , it is also an incentive .
[non-native] so i feel older generation is enjoying more than young people .
[native] i 'm glad we like our new currency , it certainly cost us .
[non-native] for example , my cousin is 3 years old , and he already go to kind of cram school to learn how to caculate and english .
[native] i agree with you though that quebec seperatism is on the wane .
[non-native] in other words , they maneged everything for you .
[native] freedom of speech in u.s. terms means the government cant punish you for what you say , however third parties can .
[non-native] moreover it is easier to buy a car nowdays with the reduction in prices and the variety which is available .
[native] under normal circumstances the eu cutting off funding ( or threatening to ) would burst this idiot 's bubble .
[native] that does n't mean that we should sacrifice our national customs , and i could understand hostility towards halloween if it was replacing native customs associated with all saints ' day .
[non-native] since there is a lot of research being done to develop alternatives for petroleum , there is a possibility that some day a fuel might be developed which is more efficient and environmental friendly than the conventional fuels being used today .
[native] good thing everyone in the world is a british teenager so that your accusation that everyone is casually homophobic is n't idiotic .
[non-native] but our manager decided to enter into that new market and that risk taking brought us many new customers then we thought and it surely worth that what we decided .
[native] ukip and the conservatives , who draw an overwhelming amount of their support from england , should be aware of the irony of complaining about being in a union where they ca n't have their voice heard .
[native] the executive is part of the house of commons ( they are mps ) .
[non-native] i do n't belive that among twenty years the car will be fewer , instead i think that the number will grow up more and more .
[non-native] in conclusion , i disagree with the statement not only because i find it 's much more fun without a tour guide but because i learn much more than a tour guide can teach me .it is a controversal problem about whether people should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or not .
[native] well , how do you know justice is done in a closed court ?
[native] communism has been turned into such a dirty word because of the incompetence of previous governments ( think ussr , pcr etc ) .
[non-native] the risk factor associated with the willingness to try everything - which is always associated with the way youngsters enjoy - makes this method one which is not worth giving even one try .
[native] especially since global warming will cause ice sheets to reduce in size , exposing even more oil reserves .
[non-native] as there are plenty of oppurtines in specific fields students should choose subject of their to excell in their academic and be a good citizen to country .after industrial revolution , there was a boost in the production of new staffs all over the wold .
[native] i think the most important factor is that it shifts what `` neutral '' is .
[non-native] some young one takes enjoyment in doing crazy things .
[native] neither country can stand toe to toe with moscow , so what happens is this gross imbalance of events .
[native] ireland has one of europe 's youngest populations resulting in a high birth rate currently and a low death rate .
[non-native] so , a specialist in specific subject is always better .
[non-native] everyday is first day of rest of our life and can be a new refreshing start .
[non-native] when i arrived to bangladesh i never thoung that i was to find a girlfriend there , i did not try to meet a muslime girlfried , i met a girl from switzerland and actually she is my girlfriend , this kind of experience i think is more difficult to live it if you travel in a group .
[native] oh , the day the french bet the british ?
[non-native] in general , a new method that creativity provides grants people to be more competitive .
[native] if one was to propose a reasonably large mediterranean island that feasibly could have its population relocated , the italian island of pantellaria is probably a good candidate .
[native] the promotion of this ideology anywhere , especially its extreme forms , is a recipe for disaster .
[non-native] we see advertisements everywhere ; on televisions , in magazines , in newspapers , on the streets , we even listen to them on the radio .
[native] alternatively , there 's '' ** review , with myles barlow ** ' , a show where the host reviews anything , from revenge and stealing , to getting a divorce and starting a cult .
[non-native] some believe that young people enjoy their lives more than the older , and would like to put an end to it , while others who think older people enjoy their lives more maintain the disagreement to it .
[non-native] in the last time you can hear much ofter guys that want to publish there opinion to take influence at the public meaning .
[native] the ecb had no right to dictate fiscal policy to anybody .
[native] never have i looked so good since i moved towns to discover the barber in my new town was an italian
[non-native] as a result , it is advisable that you should first gain a broad knowledge in advance and then make your concentration on speical subject .
[native] they routinely spout conspiracies about this war , how all ukrainians are nazis and funded by a nwo in the west , and how the us is determined to kill russia and putin .
[native] the constitution is not considered an infallible paper of eternal perfection .
[native] intent can be speculated upon but the results are real
[native] it 's something like ` how-dah ' , is n't it ?
[native] hopefully a thorough investigation is carried out into the mental state of the student and how it has come to this tragedy without any flags being raised .
[native] it is just a way of putting pressure on the conservatives and labour - to make them change their positions .
[non-native] in the school , teacher give a good and new sence to student .
[non-native] additionally , the many young people in their 20s now leave their own hometown toward the central city to live alone and enjoy their life times .
[native] ca n't the baltic countries spare a ship or two ?
[non-native] all in all , take risks and challage yourself , you will found other beautiful world and different mood around you .
[non-native] the old people they talking about every things and they think they knew every things in the life .
[native] > there 's a plan here , even if we ca n't really tell .
[non-native] second , the new technologies of car 's engine will invent for saving gasoline .
[non-native] for exemple , if a studend go to the university he will not have the time to spend for anything because he must study and he must do the homework and in particolary case he have to caught the train .
[native] the only time i 've seen reserved seats in a theatre is with this `` ultra avx '' theatre at my local one .
[non-native] so traveling with a tour guide is very helpfull to the traveler .
[native] > not really strange when the same people are 100 % in support of israel , they then becomes supporters of the hated politics and perfectly acceptable targets .
[native] i wish the origin was a little more conclusive , but unfortunately , that 's not the case .
[non-native] he was once sitting down an apple tree and he was seeing up towards the sky .
[native] am pretty sure that from a technical and legal perspective , the answer is `` non '' here .
[non-native] thus , i think there will be fewer cars in use in the future by this trane .
[non-native] advertising is often used to make certain products look wonderfull and unbreakable .
[non-native] i feel that there would be a considerable amount of increase in the use of cars in the future .
[native] younger generations seem to be flocking to it instead of aussie rules and rugby .
[non-native] it is good to people 's minds , solving many problems simultaniously .
[native] i do n't want to see them suing the united states government over subsidies to boeing anymore than i want to see boeing suing the eu over subsidies to airbus .
[native] japan , for example , is socially conservative enough that most europeans would puke .
[native] i 'm pretty sure doctors are statistically more likely to be smokers as well .
[non-native] starting from now , it might be helpful to encourage those young blood to care more about the community they are living in and make it a better place .i storongly agree with the following idea that `` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . ''
[non-native] but , one of my friend already had same product , and he bought in tokyo with lower price than mine .
[native] i do n't even drink my tap water here in canada .
[non-native] for instance , while people watch the television , they can observe an advertisement about a food .
[non-native] the need to actually move from one place to another ( let 's say for a meeting ) reduces and the need to use cars reduces as well for all the reasons explained above i think that there would be fewer use cars in use in the future .
[non-native] as a result of huge advertising campaigns carried out by automobile firms which want to maximize their profits , a social image has been created for cars .
[native] [ irish times article ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/emigration-of-irish-nationals-falls-20-in-year-to-april-1.1908275 ) also as far as the government cares the protest was about water charges nothing else hence they are reviewing their implementation .
[native] near as i can tell , the russians are causing irreparable harm to their citizens and country .
[non-native] having many subjects makes a person well round-educated one who is able to understand alot of things that face him in his life .
[native] the charity can take what it can and the rest is then discarded .
[native] that 's fine then , do as you please .
[native] true , you can lead a horse to water but you can not make it drink .
[native] the municipality of madrid is a urban area with 3.2 millions of inhabitants .
[native] here are no allies in the eu , only interests , and the uk shares many interests with many countries .
[native] i 'm in university ( yeah , usually that comes later in life ) , so most of the people around me are way older .
[non-native] to my astonishment , i can chat with a foreign .
[native] `` well russia is supplying the rebels with weapons and supplies and shelling us from their border , so we had to kill those people '' it is interesting that you play such mental gymnastics to justify such ridiculous positions .
[native] i have european citizenship , and i 've lived in europe for over 5 years ( including countries which have a lot of roma ) .
[native] i did n't realise salmond was a `` national symbol ''
[non-native] but if i or my father buy this knife we will not use knife very well .
[non-native] our cities will become more and more overpopulated and hard to move through , proving the use of public transportation as the most effective way to move around .
[non-native] cars would also be replaced by different methods of transportation that are more friendly to our globe .
[non-native] in the professional area , what you will need to do is apply what you have learned into completely different cases .
[non-native] second , there is a ruch hour , commuting time every day .
[non-native] even if the rest of the world still would use the same number of cars that is currently using , that would make the difference .
[native] > > adjective : sovereign 1 . possessing supreme or ultimate power .
[non-native] due to this reason i believe that learn facts is m ore important for students .on earth , only human can live and behavior within their own thinking , which means only human can control and develop themselves .
[native] i 'm just under the arrogant opinion that the u.s exports a lot of culture , most countries these days are culturally close to the u.s.
[non-native] as i saw earlier , i agree with the last point of view , but i think also that use of car will depend by what will be happen in the future in regard to economic elements , in particular the price of petrolium .advertising is a major category and a fast-growing trade in today 's world .
[non-native] tha't why most of the philosophers and mathematicians reach a peak a their carreer when they are old .
[native] i only turned the dial a tiny bit '' ... and the frog becomes accustomed to the warmer water .
[native] how is this small in comparison to reus trade partners ?
[non-native] first of all , to build new transportation systems friendly with the ozone and capable of transporting large masses in a cost-effective way necessitates more money than it is ever estimated .
[native] screw the west ( and their high prices ! )
[native] the hashemite kingdom of jordan killed over 70,000 palestinians in black september .
[native] it is really interesting how almost every restaurant in certain areas conspicuously display a sign `` no mafia here , voluntarily applied for special police surveillance '' basically .
[native] i 'm sure some of the shinnerbots around here will disagree .
[native] the eu is being held back by us and should be allow to go forward with their end goals of closer integration .
[native] i 'm not sure when you started looking for work , but the job market has changed considerably over the last 12 months .
[native] it 'd still be the largest military alliance in the world .
[non-native] i think adolescent people enjoy life more than elder people do .
[non-native] in conclusion i would say that considering the pros and cons above i would have to disagree with the statement that in twenty years time we will have less cars .
[native] i have an affinity for portuguese people for some reason .
[native] i run the subreddit [ r/woodenchurches ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/woodenchurches/ ) , i 'd be happy if you x-posted this link there as well , it 's been quiet over there recently .
[non-native] secondly , artists are getting more praised and encouraged because art amuse people and help them have a stable metal health .
[native] one corrupt colonel and `` seems like our equipment is missing or damaged '' .
[native] keeping the price low is the best way to do it as their oil is dirt cheap for them to get and they can make up the shortfall in volume .
[native] i do n't know why it would be included here at all .
[native] if that were so , you 'd have two houses that are essentially the same thing being used as a check against each other .
[native] you sure do have a lot of time on your hands to reply to every comment i make within seconds
[native] some members are clearly in russia 's pocket ( austria , hungary ) , some just benefit too much ( germany ) .
[non-native] so , to certain extent the stament is infact true .
[native] i knew i should 've invested in tin-foil a few years ago , the market for it has exploded lately !
[non-native] i was so thrilled by the advertisement that i bought one for me and one for my sister .
[native] the numbers of italians in the uk is increasing , not staying stable .
[non-native] so they can enjoy something such a sports or study as possible as they can .
[native] you ca n't get away with just speaking english in portugal , russia or god forbid france .
[native] good , glad to see that you can back pedal when prompted .
[native] when the eu council agreed to cut the eu budget , they already decided what programmes should be cut and agreed contributions based on that budget .
[non-native] however , before accepting this point , we need to consider some of the further issues .
[native] i hear students from tampere go to turku and jump up and down in the central square in an effort to make the city sink into the sea more quickly ...
[non-native] with the upcoming of beijing olympic 2008 , many sports are introduced at the same time .
[native] you ca n't emigrate obviously , but propaganda would also be incredibly effective since there are no alternative foreign info sources .
[non-native] in addition , it is easily obseved in modern soceity that learning the fact my be more effective .
[native] he 's not a brave soul , he 's a troll who often does this sort of thing .
[native] i do n't think that 's too difficult to pronounce , certainly not compared to some hungarian and polish place names .
[non-native] everyday people watch advertisements through the newspapers , magazies , radios and televisions .
[non-native] the all things he care is when he die .
[native] having a president nominated by parliament sounds like a good compromise , but that certainally does not mean ` directly elected ' .
[native] both japan and korea also cherish their original culture , and their pop culture is more distinct than most worldwide pop cultures - anime is a thing , but , say , russian cartoons is not a very distinct category except for language .
[non-native] finally , i think old people enjoy life more than younger people because their expectations from life are not generally big .
[native] i do n't think it 's fair to `` ask '' ireland to also leave the eu .
[native] for $ 10,000 , someone who was otherwise stateless could become a tongan protected person ( t.p.p. )
[non-native] however , i can not speak confidently about other areas .
[native] so why bring up the fact that you did n't fight any wars for 200 years
[native] the current [ minister for foreign affairs ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charles_flanagan ) is on shaky ground because [ his father ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oliver_j._flanagan ) was a notorious anti-semite that advocated driving the jews out of ireland , and he even praised the nazis .
[non-native] to sum up , i firmly believe that we must have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because we have to live in the competitive world and you do not believe that how beautiful that we can spark out .
[non-native] also , we have to check the airplane or bus we have to ride , check the weather and so on .
[native] they 're not entering the country without that countries permission , because that country makes special provisions for irregular entrants who are trying to claim asylum .
[native] people make an observation , they then assert that it is true and attempt to gather evidence and form a theory to support that assertion .
[non-native] other wise they are beeing considered as mere pippets .
[native] not everyone in the uk is impacted in the same way by an addition to the uk 's finances .
[native] the concept of post nationalism is antithetical to human nature .
[non-native] as the economic situation are becoming worse , young people lose their interest for the society and only show their interest in their own benefit .
[non-native] this experience might bring him/her alot of happininess and fun althought he / she might get caught by a police man but this young man is ready for the the adventure and he does n't care about the sequances .
[non-native] the human being 's nature dictates over any personel decision .
[native] anyone that thinks that europe has a refugee crisis clearly does n't know what the fuck they 're talking about .
[native] say that catalonia becomes independent tomorrow - considering that catalonia already has its own version of a national police ( mossos d'esquadra ) and its own government system , it 'd seem highly likely that the system would n't change that much ( asides from junqueras/mas now being president of a country instead of just a region ) .
[non-native] now social welfare is much better than it used to , and number of comunitiy work is dicreased .
[non-native] this is to say that public transport wo n't ever outcome cars . ..
[non-native] it provides much comfortable environment to ride because it does n't touch a surface underneath the body .
[native] people with foreign sounding names are consistently less likely to get jobs than the traditional natives .
[non-native] this allows students to think on the subject and generate their own ideas about the concepts .
[non-native] after the whole trip is finish , you might feel that actually you didnt visit and know the country much .
[native] i have to disagree with the fact you believe us to be culturally entwined .
[non-native] what is also worth noticing is that a person with lots of different knowledge tend to be much wiser than those who are constantly enclosed in a certain area .
[native] [ recent contradictory coverage from ria novosti ] ( http://en.ria.ru/politics/20141101/194951444/osce-observers-inspect-polling-stations-in-donetsk-ahead-of.html ) edit - [ discussion over in / r/ukrainianconflict ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/ukrainianconflict/comments/2kziof/rebels_created_fake_osce_named_asce_to_observe/ ) edit2 - note it appears to have been led by ewald stadler , a right-wing mep from austria , and alessandro mussolino , an italian political activist associated with forza italia
[non-native] however , some people think it is our duty to help others and help our communities .
[native] the eu wants it in as well , but they know the ttip is a bigger issue here than in the us so they make it seem like it 's the us ' fault .
[non-native] in the modern society time is considered more valuable than anything and theres a growing emphasis on better time management .
[non-native] another reason for learn about diverse themas could be to understand the world we are living in .
[non-native] i never thought it was right for my caracther and abilities .
[non-native] some of them think-from their experince - that taking subjects from outside the specialized area bring undesired effects .
[non-native] however , the advent of another ceo changed the fortunes of the company .
[native] they would be very disgruntled if one was to call them `` american '' , because the political entity is what people first associate them with .
[native] in any he-said-she-said situation , * someone has to bear the burden of proof * .
[non-native] even the schools and colleges would give a over all idea of the various subjects and then it will be divided into specializations .

[native] > yeah except sometimes ( like when russia killed the polish leaders ) it is really fucking extra-super-mega-convenient with a fucking cherry on top .
[non-native] a fact may leave the student only with the outer layer of an indepth knowledge related to that subject rather than understanding `` what lies beneath '' .

[native] 35,988 days ago was 1916 , a couple of years before the republic gained independence .
[non-native] what are you suppose to do when you realise that you have made the wrong decision at the very beginning .

[native] there 's a concept known as [ third culture kids ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/third_culture_kid ) that might be of interest to you .
[native] wars like that will be decided in their opening moments , and a russian offensive would have to be repelled in a quickly & timely manner before they could establish control & begin to dig in .
[non-native] first of all , to sale products you need good avertisement and a good strategy .
[non-native] governements may take actions to prevent married couples to own more than two cars for example , or other things like that .

[non-native] concepts are much more important for the development of the facts .
[native] public servants and politicians put in charge of technology in this country always seem to come from the very lowest end of the bell curve of technological understanding .
[native] > yet , the politicians here are dealing with it quite gracefully ( definitely w.r.t.
[non-native] howe , i think to have various knowledge means similar to be flexible person .
[native] or is it that it 's only here where some people are silly enough for your conspiracy and error laden posts about how the ttip is evil , how you completely misrepresent the gats ( and which i 've corrected you on a number of times ) , etc ?
[non-native] for example , if you work for a company and you need to finish your project .
[non-native] it might be true that compnies sometimes try attract a lot of people in thier advertiments but not to deceive them .
[native] secondly , the ` indirect expropriation of future profits ' does not relate to what the cepr report claimed about the ttip and it 's dishonest to try and link the two .
[native] one or the other could end in full-blown nuclear war if russia is confident enough in starting it * ( especially if america looks distracted by china & has less power projection assets in europe ) * , but america is committed to finishing it should , for example , we actually loose the baltics in those opening battles & move to take them back no matter the cost * ( which i very well could see us doing ) * .
[native] it 's sad because most real life europeans are the opposite .
[native] why did the first attempted bombing on the twin towers in 1993 occur ?

[non-native] in real life you can notice a lot of successful people .
[non-native] the main thing i recommend people who are inttending to study more than one major is to study what they love .

[non-native] for example the company i worked for had to make a decision about entering into a new market or not .
[non-native] from the arguments i have stated above it can be seen that in twenty years there will be as much cars as there are today , or even more .
[non-native] however , bill gates knew the world would change .
[native] most eu universities seem to be quite expensive for non-eu students .
[native] recognizing racial differences is not discrimination , abusing others based on those differences is .
[non-native] the ceo of google has to park his own car by himself as a normal engineers does , the office of the president is as big as the greenhand sales .
[native] we should remember that the russian historical trope is about defense , not about aggression .
[native] i hope this war finishes soon so ukraine can start to deal with their real issues , and not a manufactured `` civil war '' to destabilize kiev and distract from crimea .
[native] or you just have no explanation for my question .
[native] in essence with partition it meant little in a practical sense .
[non-native] his foundation now consists of thousands of `` young '' members who constantly work together .
[non-native] finally from the two examples above , we could easiy find out that trying the new things isthei agree with that , the successful people will try new things and take risks rather than doing only what they already know how to do well because he can get into learn new things which may be useful for his future life with good knowledge , these people put all the effort inorder to try new things with good determination and great hardwork they enjoy the risk when they fed with some sort of problem by which they come to knowledge of the problem and overcome it .
[native] what people fail to realize is russia is being pushed into this and this was the only response they could do and the west knew it .
[non-native] in reasearch , scintists are using lot of concepts for finding one application .
[non-native] but , on second thought , we may challenge our position in some ways as it is to be noticed that , on some occasions , advertisements does n't make products better than they are in real .
[native] there was such an outcry from the scottish that the police advised against burning salmond .
[native] it 's one thing when it was a few hundred years ago .
[native] i 'm going to go with pandas will win .
[non-native] `` advertisements make products seem much better than really are. '' is a product of this action .
[native] it would n't make a difference to me but i can see how it would make life easier for others

[non-native] also youth spend most of their time with friends rather than with family members .
[native] does that mean putin thinks they are no longer the best way to reach his goals ?
[native] my bad - looks like i also need to read these things more carefully !
[non-native] indeed , the aim is to make people think that they must buy this product , as a result advertisements have to convince people that this one is better than all the other one .
[native] they were clearly evil for being involved in wars like wwii and korea defending people from invasions .
[non-native] the illegal tuning / upgrading of advertisements with non-real informations or visual parts could be defined as `` lying to the customer '' , but it is a possibility to increase your current selling amout .
[non-native] it should be made as a classroom work to help the community for atleast some hours a week .
[native] well , the have sÃ©amus milne as their token unreformed communist .
[non-native] my cosin , he has a habit of readidng .
[non-native] he made film in the pyramids and he had travelled from istanbul to pyramids by car .
[non-native] advertisments are just made to attract people and to turn them into a possible customer .
[non-native] however , if i go travel with a guide , i can go only limited place and i will not feel trip , i will just take picture in ordet to show eveyone .
[non-native] they do not care about people who really need help and they are only interested in themselves .
[native] oh , so basically like `` socialism with ~ ~ chinese ~ ~ czechoslovakian characteristics '' .

[non-native] i am so confident because i have tasted its fruits in the early days , some unknown person repeated the same thing to do when i have recieved a help from him .

[native] i 'm not interested in teaching people the very basic tenets of westphalian sovereignty and the current international order .
[native] if you do n't understand context in a discussion , perhaps you should n't participate .
[non-native] because they are treasure for future .most advertisements make you to see the good way of the product , but steel been bad , for example the cigarrets , bring a advertisement that if you consume that product can cause serios problems of cancer , so that is not the advertisement make the product seem much better than they really are .
[non-native] older people can also enjoy life but due to family problems , health problems and lack of strenght they can not enjot life as much as a teen would enjoy .
[non-native] the young people who already start to study are so busy with the things they have to learn for their exams .
[non-native] for example , in advertisements for cars , advertisers manage to show only what they want to insist on , in order to attract a specific range of customers .
[native] primary schools in the children 's language could help get them started in a real life .
[native] luckily , there are no such situations in the real world .
[native] additionally the polish air force was reduced from 400 to just 54 by the 14th of september and were practically incapable of fighting the luftwaffe .
[native] also i was making a point about why people were actually out on the street , not why the government thought people were out on the street .
[native] people from the front bench would avoid the issue entirely for risk of accidentally offending someone , what with elections coming up .
[native] the people who 're in charge of sinn fÃ©in now are the same people who were heavily involved in the troubles and the pira .
[non-native] in conculusion , i definitely agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .conflicts between generations have been aroud for centuries and still generate much debate .
[non-native] thereof they make it sound nice and matching the client 's needs .
[non-native] then , i could be relax to manage my time to do an excellent work .
[native] i once waited 45 minutes during a lunch with my friends for food at a nice little place in boston .
[non-native] first , if we look at the actual trend , more and more cars are in use .
[non-native] i strongly disagree with the point that young people are not spending enough time to help others , becauses in my graduation i accompanied with several classmates and visited oldage homes to help them as part of a lending hands program conducted by our college , we dint expect any thing in return either from the college in form of certificates or from the old people , i myself had a great time helping them for that couple of days .
[non-native] for example , there is a person named anand .
[native] he was also cut off at the end by jk , and it seemed like he was about to say something really nice , like he could n't finish his point before jimmy cut to break .
[non-native] the successful persons must take such risks because they have find the new things which are helpful for further .
[non-native] so , one day we will not be able to do what we want to do right now .
[native] - they love to sit out in a plaza eating , drinking and talking for hours on end , i swear it 's all they do come the weekend .
[non-native] and as the famous saying goes `` out of site is out of mond '' , they rarely find time to think about their community .the advertisements is very fast way used in currents days to purchas , to sell , to find fast your needs of different items that the humans requires .
[non-native] two weeks ago i bought a personal computer of the last generation of computer .
[native] if those jerks at customs try to stop you , you tell them `` freeeeedooooooom ! ''
[native] > moreover , getting into that elite is largely influenced by who was who 's father as well .
[native] to defend the eu architecture , they have : - a common central bank that is buying bonds of crisis countries ( basically fiscal transfers , thinly veiled as monetary transfers since all euro countries have ecb liabilities ) soon to have : - a common banking union , which will lower costs to the private sector - the esm , which can inject nearly 1 trillion euros into banks and governments as needed .
[native] they 're suggesting it was from a fake twitter account .
[native] just not really a threat , except for morons who think there are elite criminal types sniping down space stations and stuff with them .
[non-native] cars are also being developed which run on alternative fuels , such as edible oil and cng ( compressed natural gas ) .
[non-native] old peopl usually retered their jobs , so they have a lot of time .
[native] so i should just conform to the / r/europe hivemind because they use the downvote button as a disagree button ?
[non-native] but as the rate at which the development is taking place in the country , one can expect this to change .
[non-native] well this does not only apply otme , but it alsoapplies to all of my friends , because we , the young , feel that time is going really fast , and we have many many things to do , so we do not enjoy our life , but we rather use it in accomplishing the goals we have to reach .almost everyone try to gain more enjoyable time from the life .
[non-native] but there was no single citation of anyone claiming to be the one to know little about flu , but also about every other topic .
[native] i think anyone would be sympathetic to the victims of land-theft and genocide .
[native] catalonia is n't being attacked and subjugated by spain 's military are they ?
[non-native] equally true is the fact that the grandfather might have enjoyed in his childhood .
[native] if he wins the general election , the plan is obviously to begin a gigantic bruising and exhausting game of negotiation between the uk and the reu and then for a referendum to take place .
[non-native] for example , demand for heart surgeons in hospitals is increasing day by day because of increasing heart problems .
[native] in london , the university of london administers 18 different campuses under its umbrella .
[non-native] also in todays world there is a request in people who have specializations on one topic .
[native] i said `` talk about what you 're concerned about , but do n't act as if the ttip is just going to be made up of you worst nightmares '' .
[non-native] thats what the point is , you have to walk on individual pathes and not on the pathes of somebody else .refering to the statement i believe thet it 's very complex to find the real difference between the two of them .
[native] capitalism works , but only up until a certain point .
[native] at some point , dictatorships can not adapt , the pressure builds , and they collapse , often spectacularly , to be replaced by the next one .
[non-native] huge firms such as sony , sam sung and ibm spend tredmendous of money in advertisement to build brand reconition .
[non-native] if we are interested in some specific area , we should research more information about that by ourselves .
[non-native] also , do not see just to the land we must see and look to sky .
[non-native] it gives you people to talk and have fun with , and the touch of history and education we should all receive .i disagree with this statement because without learning the facts it can get you nowhere .
[native] a woman named mairia cahill came forward saying that she was raped by a senior pira member in 1998 and then forced to meet with him in a ira `` kangaroo court . ''
[non-native] a meticulously designed and managed chain of public transportation systems likes buses and local trains would certainly encourage even the car owners to opt for them .
[native] for example : * to protect identity of witnesses * to protect identity of defendant * to prevent public from being disorderly * to prevent trade secrets from becoming known to competition * to prevent matters of national security from falling into the wrong hands those are all scenarios in which the public are banned and disallowed from viewing the proceedings .
[native] why does n't it sanction the us for it 's actions as well ?
[native] they are weak , a shell of their former self desperatly clawing at the sovet union 's former glory while being encroached on two sides by rising super powers * ( to the east china & to the west the european union ) * .
[non-native] very skilled managers with a very focused knowledge , let 's say just on a standardized pipe line , could not exploit the internet era opportunity due to the fact they were missing some crucial skills .
[native] probably because they 've been encouraged to go work in order to make money .
[native] so there is no reason why the woman 's face could n't have been viewed by the judge in-camera .
[non-native] a false advestisement can be seen like a quarter , promotion of one face of the quarter , you may be fully convinced that its great and that its all true but when you get close and see all the caracteristics you get to know that there are two sides of the quarter .
[non-native] however , if this experience is repetitive the lessons to learn from it are always the same ones .
[native] the west 's policy should be to contain russia with economic tools and let it rot from the inside out .
[native] at least i can shut my mouth and blend in .
[native] they 're generally in place to maintain a certain level of service for the customers , and a certain level of income for taxi drivers .
[non-native] for people who likes to participate , community sense is very important .
[non-native] there are several advantages of doing new things ; new experience and sense of achievement .
[native] more than half of the world : kosovo is a state .
[native] > what was life like during the cold war ?
[native] crimea would n't be able to act as a representative of russia in world politics , but that would be the only difference .
[non-native] he can choose the area of subject , in which he wants to specialize in graduation .
[native] as long as the parents wo n't abuse the child , can love a disabled child , pay for all expenses incurred and acknowledge that the surrogate mother 's rights to bodily atonomy exceeds their rights to geneticly-related children , then they should be able to have kids through surrogacy .
[non-native] in some cases , like medicine or mining , people without the right background are not legally allowed to practise at all .
[native] rightly or wrongly , they consider these credit cycles to be essentially independent events .
[non-native] in another view , it is because we are not good at everything that our life is colourful as we meet many new people when we are working in a new field .
[native] greece , this is why you 're in this mess .
[non-native] for example , if someone speaks to me about gears or engines at work , i have to know how they work properly , more or less .
[native] > > other cultures have benefits such as food , music etc but this has come at the expense of our own culture .
[native] my studies on that , and keeping an active academic and personal interest on similar issues , led me to also cover many similar topics .
[non-native] many public figures displaid in the magazines feel better in their body and in their mind because they are fifty years old .
[non-native] by increasing the number of buses ; trains and subways and quality of the servicethe problem can be solved .
[non-native] also , even if they finished their academic work , they can not ` create ' anything because they have never tried creating , but accepting everything somebody obtained .
[non-native] we shold try to have our friends or family with us .over the time , technology has always tend to improve .
[native] people like farage did n't work as city traders by being uneducated .
[non-native] they enjoy their life but they do n't think further than their own life in their little town !
[native] they seem oblivious to the fact that the united kingdom is in itself a union of nations dominated by the large and prosperous england .
[native] we 're getting something very similar in new zealand , in particular auckland .
[non-native] in the conclusion , i think every one wants to have fun when they travel somewhere .
[native] you just need to make sure your skills are right .
[non-native] moreover , students tend to care less about others nowdays .
[native] i never suggested that they were , because see , you 've only just modified your position to that now .
[non-native] this will never go away and will make people buy cars .
[native] the guardian 's comment is free pages would light up like a christmas tree .
[native] if you then look at the right , a plurality of the richest people are european , then north american , then asian-pacific , then chinese , then latin american and then the india and africa are so close i ca n't tell .
[non-native] to put it this way , say that you want to learn something in biology in plants , animals , fish , reptiles , insects and mammels .
[non-native] understanding the underlying ideas and concepts on the other hand is more interesting to most students .
[native] * we have a mentality in england ; if you speak very loudly and very slowly in english , everybody understands .
[native] yes , but that 's what parties are for , and if they are elected through a proportionate system .
[non-native] everything is in your brain , if u teach it to enjoy life it always enjoys life in every age .
[native] i 'm already willing to lose my hair & piss blood for the baltics , but let 's not keep moving the goal posts , especially when [ russia considers limited nuclear strikes to be * `` de-escalation '' * ] ( http://thebulletin.org/why-russia-calls-limited-nuclear-strike-de-escalation ) .
[non-native] true , to the extent that it allows the traveler not to worry about any plan or any decision to make , to rely on a tour guide can be an agreable way to enjoy a holiday .
[non-native] when i participated in group tour , i was really impressed in the knowledge of a tour guide .
[non-native] also , if i would want to travel with someone who needs a certain degree of comfort and protection , such as an aging parent , a group might be a good idea .
[native] `` postnationalism '' has never been applied to any country , and therefore has an unproven record .
[non-native] to sum up , people should be well-develop for life flactuations , so having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specialze in one specific subject for making different jobs and meeting new friends and gaining self-esteem which are very important ever time ,people can choose between having broad knowledge of many academic subjects and specializing in one specific subject .
[non-native] at the end , most people are really unsatisfied with the product they have bought , and end up buying the one which they really needed , and not the one that is giving you lots of promotions , that at the end does not satisfies the custumer .
[native] i think the uk , the eu , and trucidator will be doing exactly what they were going to do all along .
[native] my cousin got drugged and ended up in a pyschward after all his shit got stolen .
[native] and we see abuses of this wealth and power all across the globe , everyday .
[native] so i do n't think it means that much to say `` the eu '' cares if we leave .
[non-native] in this situation , it is impossible for you to enjoy the pleasure of travel .
[non-native] however , in most cases , these students are not recognizing what those really are , and why they are lerning those .
[non-native] nevertheless , i believe that with the new technology and the decrease of oil in the wolrd , it will be new cars which don t need oil as energy .
[non-native] however , the decreasing number of volunteers is very tragedic to the society .
[non-native] first of all , as older people have gotten much more amounts of knowledge and experiences so far , life of those people would be certainly more an enjoyable thing than that of young people .
[non-native] considering the environmental dangers of having moer cars , on the other hand , governmental and non-governmental organizations should seek and promote options other than cars .i can not agree or disagree with the statement as it stands .
[native] if there is a difference it 's not clearly defined .
[native] with the shit tony abbot ( aussie prime minister ) says i honestly would not be surprised if he said that
[native] if crimea separates from russia during that collapse , and said collapse is in the near enough future , i expect there to be direct confict with ukraine .
[non-native] but it is found that these products are causing daingerous effcts on the health of the people .
[non-native] this is why i prefer to travel on my own since when we are in a group , which are most likely from our home country , we tend to stay with them instead of knowing local people .
[non-native] excellence in any field can be achieved only when one has specialized in that specific subject and reached its pinnacle .
[native] if only we had listened to the economist bertie was insulting instead of that moron we had in power .
[native] just because there is an * association * between hiding one 's face and deceit , does not mean the girl will actually attempt to deceive the court .
[native] eh , according to [ this ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/ttip/questions-and-answers/ ) from the ec , consumer standards are n't going to be lowered as a result of the ttip .
[non-native] not only the cars are polluting , but the soaps and trashes . .
[native] i doubt we 'd see much of a difference in organised crime .
[native] the french are not going to want to stop seeking stuff to us !
[non-native] the same phenomum is occuring in countries like brasil or india .
[non-native] one had to risks his everything to create some thing new , which has value and which is useful for the people in general .
[non-native] ability of analysis and evaluation is the key to be successfull in the world such as resech programm for teachers or sales profit for company or organization related to some industry .
[native] it 's like the nations are looking into a mirror .
[native] if you are a billionaire in russia , would you risk everything you have to piss off an ex kgb leader who also happens to be a billionaire and who also happens to be in charge of your country , just so you wont lose a few million ?
[native] anyway , that was a piss poor response to a really basic question .
[native] yeah but world war 1 was n't fought over world conquest
[non-native] where as in the case of a graduate student , it is better if he specializes in one subject .
[native] there are issues with secondhand smoke from marijuana as well .
[native] so hk is told to shut up because mainlanders do n't identify with hk .
[non-native] they either travel individually or in a group led by a tour guide .
[native] why did it take so long for the us to appoint a new ambassador to canada ?
[native] people do n't seem to like how things are changing so quickly from being traditionally british in to something else .
[non-native] in general , what do students comes mind when they think about meaning of learining ?
[native] i 'm from china , and conspiracy theories featuring china ( for the pro-western crowd ) or japan ( for the pro-government crowd ) are much more popular .
[native] us allowed you to have freedom and democracy , so it 's therefore acceptable for the us to kill , or destroy livelihoods , of innocent civilians elsewhere .
[non-native] however , a person who drinks it may still feel like he is pretty thirsty .
[native] i have full faith in the organizers , i 'm just worried about idiots showing up and ruining it .
[native] in my group if we 're going clubbing/pub crawling it 's pre-drinks in small groups at 8-10pm , then everyone in our large social circle meet at the first stop at 10.30 and for the next few hours we drag our drunken carcasses around town destroying our livers .
[native] well , you and / u/salvaxe are right , i ca n't disagree with your points .
[non-native] all these would not have been achieved if the person simply did n't try during my childhood i thought i couldnot ride a cycle but later on i got courage and learnt cycling , later id did n't stop with that i learnt a motor bike .
[non-native] it was not an easy goal , he start his dream with his friend by having a small company that make a computer softwear .
[non-native] now do n't you think advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . ..
[native] they would not have been nearly as powerful had the other european states not been fighting among themselves in the first place .
[native] you really think there 's some kind of ` sjw ' conspiracy against you ?
[native] if you have children living in your home country being schooled and cared for there , you can claim our universal benefits and send it to them etc.
[native] > would you say that you prefer to hang out with people younger than you , older or the same age ?
[native] this last 100 years is literally the most stable the world has ever been .
[native] also , it would only take a few days until the canadians and the americans would throw everything they have at russia .
[native] well of course i 've questioned it , and most of my friends are n't theists either .
[non-native] to conclude , travelling in a group led b a tour guide is the best way .
[native] every group has their small amount of crazies and their chancers , why would you expect refugees to be any different ?
[native] no it does not , it says that if a decision is made to perform the operation the benefits outweigh the risks , but they do n't recommend it universally as it offers no health benefits over remaining uncut , in other words its just pandering to the parents religious beliefs , not the welfare of the child .

[non-native] in my experience being able to specialize in one specific subject gives the person an adrenaline that is not necessarily available for every single subject in the universe those who are book smart are merely unhappy in my opinion and experience they are also confused they never know what to do with their lives however to be able to specialize in one specific subject allows the person to develop a sense of passion turning it into a dream a sensation and an epiphany it is a mental perusial and a way of living for example i am not very skilled in scientific subjects such as the sciences and mathematics however i have very strong feelings for the arts specifically theatre i tend to excel in theatre possibly more than many who i know and i feel proud because it is a hard subject not everyone can have the talent but almost everybody can be booksmart even a genuis who accelerates in multiple subjects must have one foundation in which he finds his epiphany and sensations his adrenaline that causes him passion i am a firm believer in passion and talent and the fact that everyone possesses these two elements however if one flaunts their education it wont get them anywhere in life they wont be happy focusing on one thing or incorporating many subjects into one causes an epiphany and a talent and maybe those who have broad knowledge of many academic subjects will gain this epiphany if they focus on one subject gain self esteem and enter the real world where knowing everything is not necessarily anythingi prefore to travel with a tour guide exspecially we go to some country and also that is a first time to go there .

[native] i also grew up in a state atheist country , china , if that matters at all .
[native] also , there are holiday celebrations , sometimes local or regional things in the us , where everyone goes around saying `` kiss me , i 'm irish '' or st. patrick say .
[native] except it would n't start out as russia pressing a big red button to fire all their nukes .
[native] do n't assume the doomsday scenario is going to be the final outcome , because it probably wo n't be '' .
[non-native] like alternative transportation which does n't cause the air pollution .
[native] but if it goes through , it 's expected to raise the gdp of both the us and the eu by around 2 % , will create a common standard of regulations in many areas ( meaning that , by virtue of the size of the free trade area , other countries will have an incentive to adopt those regulations as well ) .
[native] there are n't many other countries around the world were competition is constrained to the degree the guy earlier proposed .

[non-native] but to the child who is watching the advertisement , it seems as if the toy is doing things on its own .

[non-native] the same happens with students : we need to further our education in order to be more competitive to be accepted for example in a college .
[native] implying that serbia was the victim in ww1 is asinine and shows a marked lack of knowledge of your own history .
[native] unlike countries like china where all international traffic ( even , say , tibet to india ) is routed through beijing and shanghai , isps lay random border-crossing lines everywhere ; there is no real distinction between international and national traffic .
[native] `` she also said that germans want to ignore the holocaust '' germany is pretty much the one country in history to actually address what they did and admit it was wrong and they even go over the top in a lot of cases .

[non-native] so if you want to be a successful person like these famous people in the history , first of or , you should try news things , create new things for the society , not only do some common things in your lives .
[non-native] therefore , this results of a growing automobiles usage in our daily life .
[native] you are entitled to the seller fixing it for you ; do n't be put off by talk of the manufacturer or warranty periods .
[non-native] if this is not learned the student will not be able to work on the facts and will be like an database full of information and unable to use them .i think that the question to either have a broad knowledge of a variety of subjects or to have a good and specialised understanding in one subject is a difficult one .
[native] shared values/religion make for an easy fit into society .
[non-native] along with the method of using the facts , using the proprate information or facts is inportant , too .
[non-native] first , students spend so much time on their study that they do not have any spare time to help the others .
[non-native] as a conclusion , i would say that enjoying life is not really a matter of age but rather the way one handle with it .
[non-native] thus , i disagree the following statement .many things in the world are so complex , if we want to get all facts that it might be take a long time to understand all .
[non-native] they can even benefit from special fees as regard transport and entertaiment , and realise some dreams they never thought due to a lack of time and money .

[native] politics of most countries involves elected officals acting in the interests of the elected body they represent .

[non-native] but , usually young people enjoy it and happy about their life more than older people .the best way to travel is in a grup led by a tour guide
[native] when i was a child i pronounced ` colonel ' as ` call-oh-nell ' and ` relatives ' as 're - * late * - ivs ' .
[non-native] this is also important in the younger years of a students life , because most of the students have not decided what they will do in their future life .
[non-native] and you keep reading the magazine , it is not difficult to more advertisement .
[non-native] while it is good to know a little bit of everything that surrounds you , it does not harm to have specialized knowledge of one subject .
[native] if the uk or france were faced with the prospect of utter annihilation as a state , then it is entirely possible for nuclear weapons to be used whether the us is okay with that or not .
[native] it 's ok , i have no freakin idea what 's going on either re : wurscht
[non-native] it 's the way to learn knowledge , by means of the mothod and we can find more necessary information than we expect .
[native] maybe i 'm stupid , but perhaps you could explain that to me ?
[native] it is also much better for the wait staff - they do n't have to be exposed to poison smoke as part of their job .
[non-native] there is nothing wrong with that point , but your life and knowledgent are going to be limited only in what you know .
[native] they begin to feel extra persecuted , which fuels their reasons for rebelling/warring .
[non-native] as a lawyer , it would be a big mistake for me to concentrate on only one single subject .
[native] i thought it was a recent thing since i heard about it taking place in the uk last year , but apparently that 's not the case the following editions of the tour started outside france : [ 117 ] 1954 : amsterdam , netherlands 1958 : brussels , belgium 1965 : cologne , west germany 1973 : scheveningen , netherlands 1975 : charleroi , belgium 1978 : leiden , netherlands 1980 : frankfurt , west germany 1982 : basel , switzerland 1987 : west berlin , west germany 1989 : luxembourg , luxembourg 1992 : san sebastiÃ¡n , spain 1996 : den bosch , netherlands 1998 : dublin , republic of ireland 2002 : luxembourg , luxembourg 2004 : liÃ¨ge , belgium 2007 : london , united kingdom 2009 : monte carlo , monaco 2010 : rotterdam , netherlands 2012 : liÃ¨ge , belgium 2014 : leeds , united kingdom 2015 : utrecht , netherlands
[non-native] however , teaching only facts can not be the aim of an education .
[non-native] but where should we place the limit between a wisdom acquierd by learning the facts and a knowledge based on concepts ?
[native] european citizens are supposed to be entitled to the same treatment as citizens in the host country .
[native] more like 200 . http://news.nationalpost.com/2014/09/20/canadian-government-revoking-passports-of-citizens-trying-to-join-extremist-groups/ > the government says about 30 canadians are with extremist groups in syria and 130 are active elsewhere this is dated september 20th , so pretty new .
[non-native] with the current levels of specialisation that the advances in science and technology has brought about in our work lives , it is nearly impossible to be very good at two things .
[native] and we have a defense contract with the british , so its not like we even need it .
[non-native] once an option is spotted the process of `` professionalization '' starts again .
[non-native] because many people who dont have access to these advertisements dont know much about the product and therefore they dont show interest to buy them .
[native] then they could have just not signed up to the maastricht treaty ...
[non-native] as u know turkey is not a developed country .
[native] you keep popping up either attacking them or just spouting hibernophobic comments for the hell of it .
[non-native] to me , there is a big difference between `` understanding '' and `` learning '' .
[native] > there were concerns that a foreign vessel - possibly from russia - was in swedish waters , but after an extensive search , sweden 's military said it thought that the suspected submarine had moved on .
[non-native] so that 's why they are not very interested in their community .in my daily business i am working as a consultant for a german consultancy company .
[non-native] at the same time it is also important to increase one 's knownledge in other sectors/subjects .well , i disagree with the statement that says `` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts '' .
[native] on this basis the ps might just as well select christine taubira .
[non-native] as one man , if you have agood advertisement about your product , you will have agood idea around the world .
[native] calling them garbage is offensive to me too , but he 's probably right in that the majority coming are the less educated and lower class syrians .
[native] the political union between english and french canada is partially contingent on quebec being able to maintain its legal customs ( scotland has a similar condition in relation to being part of the uk ) .
[native] except it was literally under the blog section of citizen.org , the header of the place you linked to is `` public citizen 's blog on globalization and trade '' , and it 's an organization that does n't have any special knowledge on the deal .
[native] it 's also the difference between wanting ukraine to end up like poland or finland instead of kazakhstan or belarus .
[native] on what basis did you think you would be allowed to say that ?
[native] we are also talking about foreign companies , but you forgot that , did n't you .
[non-native] it is true that nowadays young people are always rushing to and fro , since due to the competitive world we live in , we have really tight schedules .
[native] these countries do n't agree on much of anything as it is , and the big three ( russia , india , china ) all consider each other as rivals and potential threats .
[native] clearly , advocating for brutality and slaughter is not compatible with the aims of a liberal democracy .
[non-native] he wanted young people to come together , to share ideas and resources to reach one goal , that they all shared - ` make the children strong , for tomorrow they make the world strong ' .
[non-native] therefore , they can enjoy life very much at their older ages .cars
[native] i * am * saying that removing her burqa in public * may * be very embarrassing for her .
[native] almost half of toronto was born outside canada and it 's one of the safest large cities in north america .
[native] also , israel indiscriminately killing civilians is an entirely stupid way of seeing the conflict .
[non-native] first of all , i prefer that specializing in one specific subject because it provides people with exciting learing environments .
[non-native] and much more which other ages people can not do .
[non-native] for all these evidences , i do persist in believing that the young enjoy life more than the old do , though the fact that you may encounter some old people who take life as it is and live it dayly , and therefore , who enjoy it more than some young people .i think understand ideas are important to students .
[native] and ... how do you feel about this ideal in relation to the current israel/palestine situation or a theoretically divided great britain ?
[non-native] even though i may encounter dangerous or strange situation , i prefer traveling alone .this world we live in has always managed to find its way of a change such as what we have today : the common usage of cars every where .
[native] implicit here is that separatism works from the inside .
[native] he wanted american soldiers to remain under the condition they be subject to iraqi courts , the same ones he had a hand in corrupting & increasing sectarian strife in , so he can suck my american balls for that .
[native] this never works , it only emboldens the hawks .
[non-native] so he can build a network which could be very useful in his life .
[native] if russia starts moving troops toward the baltic borders nato will respond in kind .
[non-native] they can go to club , date weman , dancie with everyone , and the youn people cant finguer the life in this age .
[non-native] they derserve their success because they have worked for it .
[non-native] to communicat them , my range of thinking is more bigger ever before .
[non-native] second thing is when got sick there will be somone take care of you and help you .
[native] i work as an economist and i closely follow policy issues .
[non-native] for example let us take a student doing his project work on developing automobile efficiency .
[native] i just do n't see what we 'd have to gain .
[native] the relationship does hurt us just as much as it helps us .
[non-native] but , on the other hand , many reasons encourage me to disagree with the discussed statement and say that young people do not always enjoy life more than older people do .
[native] for all they know , it could be some turkish paid mercenary sent to report back on the state of kurdish military readiness .
[native] would still have had crimea and the war in the east would not be happening .
[non-native] however , there is a discussion about whether these arguments make these products seem much better than they really are or people can trust in these advertisement about the information about the products .
[native] cus it 's a whole bunch of countries , maybe it could be argued that one of its basic premises is multilingualism .
[non-native] industry is looking for highly trained specialists , engineers , physicians and phycisists .
[non-native] before helping a community , they should , in fact , understand what a community is .
[non-native] first of all , students should know have knowledge about the many subjects because they can find something from the the other subject related with their subject .
[non-native] let 's say for example , like advertising alot , teaching our kinds , and leaving the car often at house parking lot , riding with neigh if we want to live in a beautiful country , ofcourse we have to take good care of our home place also .
[native] the uk government needs to become more effective and using the eu so that when a company like dyson has concerns about regulations being too lax they have support .
[native] ca n't wait to speak english in germany and have nationalists get angry at me , only for me to show them my german passport i do n't even speak german .
[native] it just came across as a childish attempt to justify a certain behavior of some american tourists because of the past deeds of american soldiers .
[native] > are you seriously so retarded as to believe states , and the us in particular , act only out of fear ?
[native] so it is , i had just read the guardian version of it before starting on the comments here .
[native] rather than expect poorer eu countries to be fully dependent on their wealthier counterparts .
[non-native] as an another point of view , a person who works only one subject may likely to help to develop a device for humankind .
[native] ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/john-tierney-needs-to-be-front-and-centre-for-irish-water-1.1975978 ) * sinn fÃ©in ( the political wing of the pira ) has been in the spotlight all week over revelations of how the pira handled allegations of [ sexual abuse and other crimes .
[native] i do n't think its because they consider russia to fit their ideals , but that russia stands opposed to the west in their minds .
[native] those guys based off the wiki page sound more like nazi thugs then anything else i can think off .
[non-native] if we had n't had people willing to risk a new method of crop raising , or use of pesticides , we would n't have the increased quantities of grains that we do today .
[native] indeed , one might call it a prime example of bullshit .
[native] it is n't only the fact they 're hurting at their wallet , it 's that they see the us gov ' t as bloated , corrupt , wasteful and inefficient .
[native] as the other poster said `` people in glass houses ... '' however , i am sorry if i offended anybody with what i wrote .
[non-native] the following are the three main supporting reasons to my position .
[native] which will be worth nothing if america decides it wants ten new states or china wants to impose maoist thought in a wider area .
[non-native] some people might be coragous , some very lucky .
[native] why would your average catholic northern irish want to give up the nhs and their cushy civil service job/uk unemployment benefit for the uncertaintly of ireland ?
[native] unfortunately , by the time we managed to do that , maliki had already entrenched himself in power thanks to years of sectarian strife , and given that the referendum deciding the american occupation 's future happened so soon after patreus had managed to really begin to get a grip on the situation , our image was still hurt badly & it put us in a position where the only way we could stay was if we aquised to allowing our troops to be tried by iraqi courts ... which no american president would 've ever agreed too ... ** edit : ** although probably the greatest mark against american foreign policy in this matter is the fact we went into iraq over a bullshit wmd excuse instead of just saying we 're going in to topple a genocidal dictator .
[native] why are you uncomfortable around people who look different from you ?
[non-native] he would never have invented the bulb if he did not take the risk and try some thing different .
[native] the city is filled with people from every social class , from all over the world .
[non-native] as you seen above it is definitely sure that young people enjoy their lives more than older people .
[non-native] for exmple , now more and more yung students are going to university and spending a lot of time there .
[native] `` proof by strong gesticulation '' is no proof at all , my friend .
[non-native] they no more have the power they were had , nor in their childhood not in their young days .
[native] maybe you need a few days to relax or something .
[non-native] to understand the ideas , they have to look for more informations of the ideas by finding in the libaries , searching on the internet , and also getting helps from the others .
[non-native] alternating work and dormancy in your life pace with activities and exercise is of great benefit to the body and the mind .
[native] so you 're saying there 's not really a boundary , people just arbitrarily make one up whenever they want to suit their preconceived notions ?
[non-native] second important point to consider about this issue that car accidents cause many innocent deads more than wars .
[non-native] moreover , they do not feel the pressure from the society .
[non-native] it is that strive to maintain your identity which determines if you obtain your goals .
[non-native] on the other hand , when children grow and become students , they have to specialize in one or a few subjects in order to work in companies .
[non-native] naturally it is important to work together with people of different academic fields , as it is wanted by interdisciplinarity strategies , but that does not mean that everyone has to everything .
[non-native] i definitly think that they are both essential in the ppreparation of a student and that they should be used in a very balanced way .
[native] speaking of your youtube comment , i do n't deny that it is possible the pro-eu side has done this , but i 'm also sure that many many people have chosen to go there on there own .
[native] jesus , this should n't be so hard to understand .
[non-native] often i may concentrate one thing , forget important things .
[native] as you 're probably aware , for historical reasons , there are very negative connotations with being confused as british .
[non-native] however , this nature of advertisements has become a growing concern today .
[non-native] cars are one the most used ways of transportation .
[native] but even so , you linking to something else does n't change the fact that you misrepresented what was in the report you posted earlier .
[non-native] enjoying life needs power , endurance , indepandent , strenght , activity and much things that older people do not have or have but in less level than young people have .
[non-native] therefore , the risk is definitely worth taking !i disagree with thie stament because i think there are meny young people work hard and give enough time to helping their communties , so , there are many reasons to disagree with this statment .
[non-native] however , this does not mean that the young people nowadays spends little time to helping their communities , which can be their school communities or local town .
[native] the fault is with the people , not with the lobbyists or politicians .
[non-native] you can not see a little thing but is very important .
[non-native] 300 years ago there was no supermarket in small villages .
[non-native] though some people may think that too much interest will make the man good at nothing .
[non-native] however , these people should know that this way for commercials do not attractsome companies show products not over they really are .
[non-native] finally , having mastered one particular subject in great detail , make that person expert of it .
[non-native] for example , when we travel in a group , we can share our funny stories , chat with one anothe , and even play some interesting games .
[native] i do n't entirely disagree with you , but i 'd just like to point out for the sake of the conversation that this is coming from a turk , whose government does n't have the most objective position on this sort of thing .
[native] you dont need that level of power unless its industrial .
[native] the far left-wing and far right wing look more and more alike every day .
[non-native] the solution for this problem is to construct them more .
[non-native] some people might agree with the statement because recently knowing products always make people think it is the best without full understanding of inner part of products .
[non-native] countries like switzerland , using electric buses show concerns about it .
[non-native] for instance a car company will show in its advertisement how fast its car is or how safe it is .
[non-native] in the second place , reduce the car in use can give people some changes to do much sports such as running or walking .
[native] and in this respect , and in their attitudes to ethnic minorites and so forth , australia and canada are very like their anglosphere cousin , the uk .
[non-native] for example if a student is intrested in doing mathematics and his academics deals with lot of subjects .
[native] you 'd throw away economic integration with europe for what , then ?
[non-native] perhaps i would like to explain other students what i have learned or try to help them if they do not understand something .
[native] it 's attitudes towards healthcare , worker rights and weapons are practically third world .
[non-native] people must be strong and keep their energy for ever .
[native] i hope the internet stays in its `` wild west '' phase for a long time .
[non-native] nevertheless , did the elders hide in their rooms and never come out and have their own fun ?
[native] an unstable right wing populist coalition in an attempt to keep sinn fÃ©in out of power either way , i predict a great deal of political instability here in the future if current trends continue .
[non-native] it required courage but also lots of imagination and self-confidence .
[non-native] microsoft is always taking risks and introducing new ideas and trying new things in the market causing microsoft to still grow and strive in the market .
[non-native] i was so surprised with its price and did not noticed that it was bad for the hair .
[native] shh indonesia if estonia invoked article 5 , other nato countries * have * to do something , or nato would probably disband ( what good is a defense alliance if they do n't trust each other to defend each other ? ) .
[native] even if ukraine manages to shut down the current separatists , they 'll have to deal with interference for a while .
[native] to confirm the validity of the email , a random string is sent back and needs to be replied , or a link sent to the email that they have to click on to complete the dmca .
[native] also the national party in new zealand , though they 're closer to center right .
[non-native] for me , being successful means being one of the top , without regard to the field or area you are in .
[native] this is n't some conspiracy , it 's just been determined that 's the best way to do it .
[non-native] but success is the product of knowledge and looking forward .
[non-native] as a proof of this idea , the saving rate in my country has been the first place for long period in the world .
[non-native] if a company is searching for a new translater for english , it does not help that an applicant is also able to speak french and italian , if the result is that the english skills are only good instead of very good .
[native] i do n't think it 's something that we should be seriously concerned about now , but in a generation or twenty years it could be a very real possibility if europe does n't up it 's military spending and/or strengthen eu military integration .
[native] > i 'm saying it was real fucking convenient , is all .
[native] do n't overestimate our momentary tolerance & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ;
[native] poland , czech republic , and slovakia also saw massive gains in gdp/capita .
[non-native] the importance of the companys brand is increasing all the time because the customer doesent have the time or the knowledge to evaluate a product .
[non-native] because they are old , they ca n't have fun . ''
[non-native] as a result all of that we can say advertisements do not show the products better than they really are because companies are afraid of losing credibility and getting sued .one may argue that it is suitable to get broad knowkedge in many academic fields or just to specialize in one subject in my point of view it depends on your life expectation and where your plan to use your knowledge in academic world nowadays it is almost impossible to think the contrary of being specialiazed in your field that you are aming to without the speciliazation how can the industrialization may occur all the technology we are using requires much sophisticated knowledge each days in addition to this it is very surprising to constate that the fields we specialized may become a general area of study because it may be divided into sub catagories there is no doubt that it is essential to have basic knowledge about the related fields for example engeneering in aviation does require a broad knowledge in jet engines metals air dynamics etc according to the field or your work you will choose you will be faced to have to broden your knowledgesome people would like to travel by themseleves , while other prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide .
[native] i do n't know did you read that article , or the [ survey ] ( http://www.neareastconsulting.com/surveys/all/p22/ ) to which it refers , but i ca n't find the data that suggests 75 % support hamas .
[non-native] it is absolutely much more useful for students to adapt the society and live in the world directly and more successfully .
[native] same way you fine an individual who pays taxes ?
[native] that 's paying cash for the shortest journeys on the bus .
[native] because i 'm not referring to [ false balance ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/false_balance ) .
[non-native] but sometimes the youngsters do help their communities by inventing new things and implementing new ideas .
[non-native] with the improvements in computer technology , a lot people have a lot of friends in different continents whom they shared their feelings , expectations and so on .
[native] even if this is one of europe 's worst crises , germany doing `` the other thing '' was the worst crisis in history .
[native] most christians and muslims ca n't handle the fact that some people did n't convert or converted back .
[non-native] as i tried to gain knowledge on elctronics subjects i was unable to concentrate on the subject which i used to have knowledge earlier and i even lost my knowledge on that subject .
[native] hahahaha :d that 's actually the german word for orgasm - and i am guessing that holds for some other languages ?
[native] > the principle of subsidiarity has been meaningless in practice , however .
[non-native] we can quote the example of the british car brand bleinheim which present their luxury cars in a pretty poor way .where i live , japan , poeple spend their vacation on travel around the world .
[native] should we allow blanket intelligence surveillance on all of them just because they 're muslim , or do we accept that we should not target groups , religions , skin colors , because it 's a discriminatory thing to do ?
[non-native] in fact , it is estimated that there are more than 500 unique sports in the world .
[native] kaiulani kahalekai , a princess and spiritual leader of native hawaiians flew directly from hawaii to kiev .
[non-native] but elderly are far away from all this work related stress as they are nolonger working .
[native] yes , because otherwise we 'll probably continue laying off the army and building fewer and fewer ships for each new replacement class ...
[non-native] ofcourse im hoping that a new type of transportation mean would be achieved because cars can be such a bother , for example car accidents and parkings and most importantly car oil or fuel .
[native] it was interesting to see protesters surrounding planned parenthood locations and screaming some of the most vile things to the people going in there .

[native] i 'm curious that you 've chosen to use the outdated gni metric .
[non-native] when you are looking for new topics , you are always interested in researching , learning and actuallize your knowledge .
[native] on the other hand , how would it look if the icc were spending hundreds or thousands of man-hours prosecuting israel for a handful of deaths when rwandan warlords responsible for thousands of deaths are not prosecuted , or bashar al-assad , or any one of the hundreds of people or entities who have killed orders of magnitude more people than israel ?
[non-native] i did not sleep at all to be prepared for the test , but anyway , i did not pass .
[native] > what i do n't get is what on earth where people shop has to do with it .
[non-native] they show the product but often they do n't even discuss the predictions of it .
[non-native] concluding , i would like to say that `` its always better to be a lion in the jungle than an ant in a colony '' . i will always choose to specialize in one subject than have a braod knowledge of many academic subjects .cars in the modern world are one of the most essential objects in life .
[non-native] some people prefer the travelling that is in group and is led by a guide , and would like to put an end to it , while others do not think this is the best way .
[native] two of our last 3 presidents were women who served two terms each , our deputy prime minister is a women ( the second from 2 governments ) along with 3 more ministers of state , the head of our police force is a women , two of our supreme court judges are women and the heads of several government bodies .
[non-native] we still would have been living in the dark .
[native] take the [ water privatization in cochabamba ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_cochabamba_protests ) for example , a privatization that was such an egregious crime against the public that it 's barely conceivable a country would do that .
[native] also , in the same sentence you proclaim that long-standing cultural practices are irrelevant , but then immediately try to support your argument by quoting a long-standing western cultural norm .
[non-native] if you want to prove yourself into success , the way you do it 's that to learn more thing and whaen someone is asking you , you need to able to answer them .
[non-native] the reason is that their parents have the children learn many things .
[non-native] understanding ideas and concepts are very important for students because if they just learn facts they would n't understand them when it comes to more detailed topics .
[native] at a time when unemployment rates in europe already stand at record levels , the commission recognizes the ` legitimate concerns ' that those workers who lose their jobs as a result of ttip will not be able to find other employment .

[non-native] even though he could earn so much money , he tried new things such as making a long animated film for the first time .
[native] it 's like you want to go stick your head in a bee hive and go on about how bees should not be stinging you .
[native] > this paranoia that the baltic states have over this supposed russian aggression is both hilarious and sad .
[non-native] so they deliberately omitted that their products are now inferior in many aspects .
[native] that being said , i believe the correct charge for these people should be something along the lines of `` assisting a terrorist organisation '' , which should be enough to lock them away for a long time .
[native] how many hops away from the ballot box does power have to travel for it to be undemocratic ?
[non-native] they did not tavel to it before and meeting differint kind of culture that would be very wonderful .
[non-native] first reason is older people had fun when they were young .
[non-native] thank you .in my oponion and my life experinces i agree with this satmant the people who is successful always try to do anew things that is not done befor and looking forward to found and descover new things , for example a professor in universty who is succesed in his reseach always try to find a new ideas for rearch and develpment , wher the researcher try do new experment he may affect him self for a kind of risk a becouse he do something new and investegate some thing that 's no one do befor .
[native] i agree that lots of people are good at identifying a problem , but not acting upon it .
[native] i was n't trying to comment on this mans political views , simply that this man may have this flag up for reasons beyond the extremely simplified european view .
[native] i 'm not sure why but liverpool for some reason has a shit tonne of supports down here .
[native] here in the us , the place where that flag is from , it certainly has those connotations as well .
[non-native] second , there are lots of things for the youngsters to enjoy .
[native] the difference between , say [ gullah ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gullah ) , [ appalachia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/appalachia ) , the [ louisiana creole ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/louisiana_creole_people ) , and others throughout the usa is far more than simply a `` different kind of pizza '' and an accent : there are very real linguistic , cultural , and religious differences between those people .
[native] the nazis had to top up their death-squad soldiers with alcohol to have them handle the mass murders .
[native] there are many cultural ties between ireland and scotland going back thousands of years .
[non-native] besides this skills , your general culture will improve and people look at you admirable .
[native] * > cameron is a europhile cameron is pro-business/financial sector and believes it would be bad for business/the financial sector to leave the eu .
[non-native] if the agent did not pay attention to these concepts during training he/she will probably end up issuing a permit which is not required .
[non-native] and to support this there is famous quote , `` jack of all trades but , master of none '' .i do n't agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to help their communities .
[non-native] the experts argue that one of the successful key is to be a curious person , and a good example that it 's true , is that the most important inventors and scientists in the world ( einstein , bell , cristobal colon ) achieved their goals because they tried to discover and explain things or facts that the normal people considered common or impossible , so they did n't worry about them .
[native] holstein was , for a long time , a contested area .
[native] the reality of daily life was that the warsaw pact and the iron curtain seemed very far away from us .
[non-native] a particular way to help old people is , go out with they .
[native] that said , there 's certainly considerably more that could be done at a european level to alleviate the stresses on the italian system .
[native] no country in the world opposes the theoretical existence of a palestinian state .
[non-native] second , young poeple has more chances to study many subjects , for example in university or private school .
[native] you entered the war after france was attacked , lets not make up facts now .
[native] it seems i did , and i retract my previous statement , except for the part where i say some things can be more important than economics ... a peaceful national identity that wants liberty is not necessarily a bad thing .
[native] well , domestically you always get editorials in state-run media against the us , so there 's that .
[native] in the us , they use mexicans for agricultural production .
[native] he took inspiration from [ bookchin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/murray_bookchin ) 's theories .
[native] i just tend to believe that partition is a bad thing , but i would support catalans to seek independence in any legal way possible - so they should probably start with seeking allies in the millions of other spaniards who also need to change the constitution to achieve their goals .
[non-native] finally , for those reasons i have presents above , i think there will be fewer cars in use in the future .i agree with this statement .
[native] english is really well established now , with chinese opting to learn english rather than the other way around .
[non-native] of course , there is an argument to be made for other posotions .
[non-native] if i want to win a case in court in - for example , a case where technical questions are to be considered - it is not enough to just know about the law .
[non-native] however , if that person takes a risk to choreograph a hip hop piece , there will also be a possibility to be a successful choreographer .
[native] two competing world views . . the u.s one on nato and liberal self-determination while russia sees the end of the cold war as making nato somewhat obsolete and an encroachment on their sphere of influence , much like we in the u.s have long standing monroe and roosevelt corollary doctrines of non-interference in our hemisphere .
[non-native] sometimes people are just being too busy to help rather than unwilling .
[non-native] the successful people should try daily new new things because they are used for further that it is easier than the previous one. `` successful people should try new things by taking risks '' .in general i agree with this statement .
[native] the middle class in asia is growing very rapidly , and to sell to it they feel they need national treatment/most favored nation to apply .
[non-native] however , when i travel in a county where i can not communicate with local people by myself due to language reasons , i am relieved to accompany with a tour guide .
[native] [ as the uk economic recovery continues , the opinion polls make this seem more likely , though this will be the oddest uk general election since the war . ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_next_united_kingdom_general_election ) .
[native] yes , it seems like we 're not getting the full story over here , only the really big issues .
[non-native] for example , you do n't have passed your exams when you were young .
[native] there are many anti-govs , but you wo n't see them much since chinese net has censor bots , and english social networks are blocked or unpopular .
[native] how do you know they 're illegal immigrants and not refugees ?
[non-native] moreover , there is a growing gap between the individual and his/her parents .
[native] but yes you 're right the uk will probably just pay up later on once everyone has forgotten about it because the uk is fucking useless at the political horse trading required to get ahead in the eu .
[native] if the police turn a blind eye , why do they routinely arrest people for it ?
[native] i would 100 % say that tax avoidance is a negative thing ...
[native] but yes , they 're not done in national courts because the whole idea of isds provisions is that domestic governments and courts are inherently biased against the foreign investor .
[native] why is the uk so damn euro-sceptical in the first place ?
[non-native] these things are costs too much for the young people to enjoy often .
[native] it seemed a fair exchange for the stoning comment , which would have worked better if ( a ) the us had n't funded the taliban for years , ( b ) had n't remained a staunch ally of saudi arabia , which also stones women , and ( c ) had n't created the power vacuum that created is .
[native] lack of compulsory voting how many people would move to australia and how fast ?
[non-native] whereas if you understand a topic , you do not have a mental and intellectual limit anymore which are consequences of ignorance .
[non-native] of course at the beginning , the process to explore new things is difficult and long , sometimes you have to try with a lot of things and spend so much time before find what really do you want to do or your vocation .
[native] so if i wanted to look for similar jobs in the uk , what would the job title be ?
[native] if `` going full ` murican '' is to not give a fuck about defending your position on sunday afternoon after a few hours over something this trivial consider me to bleed red , white & blue .
[non-native] i 'm studing design , and how can i learn the topics of the projectation without testing on my skin how project work ?
[non-native] however , there are many people like to risk actually to improve their lives or to do something important .
[non-native] most probaly , a graduate student , like one after completing his masters will go for a job .
[non-native] it helps to keeps the body fit and healthy and it also helps to keeps fresh and active all the day .
[native] presumably thanks to rule 6 : > this is a moderated forum , to maintain a civil environment , ** and a high level of debate .
[non-native] when somebody liks one particular subject the most , he or she doesnt have to spend unnecessary time in reading and understanding the other subjects .
[native] even in the us , where private deleveraging has been rapid , overall deleveraging has been small .
[native] except , it can cause problems urinating and having sex as it means your ca n't pull your foreskin back over the head , and there 's not a whole lot of options available to help other than circumcision .
[non-native] then succesful people have to design new concepts in order to be recognized by the sociaty a successful .
[native] some english regional accents use `` aye '' , or used to , and english speakers can often guess the speaker 's region or colonial country just from hearing them say `` yes '' .
[native] 2 ) he deserved it and can go fuck himself .
[native] > as far as i know there have n't been any studies measuring xenophobia in the uk per se .
[native] actually ireland is so high because we currently have a extremely young population .
[native] the uk 's particular history and geography make the uk more eusceptic .
[native] people only go during religious holidays , as well as for births/deaths/marriages .
[non-native] on the other hand , older people that retired from their works are much more at ease with their lives .
[non-native] personnally , i do not agree with this statement .
[non-native] from this process , i could also develop problem solving skills in society .
[native] but it is unlikely that russia would attack sweden without nato coming to your aid , so more realistically , all that would happen and then you would wait a few weeks or months until the u.s. and the uk could liberate you with those militaries that your people so regularly condemn .
[non-native] we do end up studying different subjects and that is good as it makes us aware of a whole lot of basic information etc. about so many fields of study that have close bearings on our lives .
[non-native] also , young people do not have to give time to help their communities .
[native] :| i like australia and want to live with my partner there but i just wish people would stop mocking my accent and asking me if i eat potatoes for every meal/if i my family are destitute poor/if i am marrying my partner for a visa/if i believe in adam and eve / etc.
[native] after all , being gay is not a choice , but being violent is always a choice .
[non-native] i think there would be some good reasons for getting young people nowadays can be more invoed with their communities .
[native] i 'm sorry to say this but it 's very optimistic .
[non-native] like he can not explain well enough to doctor like an illeterate , if there is any problem with his health .
[non-native] in this world , everything have two view sides : right or wrong .
[native] http://www.pewglobal.org/2012/06/13/chapter-4-rating-countries-and-institutions/ ( the graph is at the very bottom of page 5 in chapter 4 ) it might be interesting to point out that the number of people with a favorable opinion about nato in russia is 22 % .
[non-native] then , the classic thinking - as well as the constant socioeconomic changes - brought the idea of being speciallized in order to compete in a work market .
[non-native] the ball hit her eye and was bleeding badly .
[native] even if a single country were created it would have to be a very loose confederation .
[non-native] that is why , a person ca n't be a doctor or engineer at a time and ca n't be expert in both the fields .
[non-native] but maybe it is not the only way to have success .
[non-native] atlast my opinion regarding the successful people is they should take the risks because they are the people who can raise their aims by taking the risks .
[native] in a few years , the combined population of russia and its eurasian cronies will be less than bangladesh 's .
[non-native] people who adopt this strategy have to be very carreful .
[native] if your legal system is incapable of making this distinction , then it 's poorly constructed .
[native] meanwhile , their country of origin continues to change naturally .
[native] that does n't work well with the american narrative on pc issues .
[non-native] without facts students would have no basis to discuss about .
[native] [ the actual response of the israeli embassy ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jvhybry.jpg ) .
[non-native] some times we buy before do any research in differents products of the same kind .
[non-native] thus , at some time at the later stage you feel that life was very joyful when you were young therefore i think that young people enjoy life more that old people do .i agree with the above statement , because it is really an inportant for the students to analyse , understand the ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
[non-native] of course facts must be thought to the students later , after explaining the ideas and concepts clearly in detail .
[non-native] because everyone wants to lose weight , the advertisements appear frequently than other kinds of advertisements .
[native] loaning money to people who ca n't afford to pay it back is only profitable if you 're a thug and you do n't mind threatening to break bones if you do n't get the money the very next day .
[native] you 're almost certainly correct - i assumed there might be some countries where the executive has the power to sign trade deals directly , and others where the parliament vote will be basically a rubber stamp .
[non-native] in my point of view , whether to choose or not is not a critical matter , and personal preference should be respected .
[non-native] if you stick to the adopted methods you will only go to a certain limit .
[native] that means they can both afford to have a lower land productivity , so they need less investments , and enjoy advantages of scale that simply are n't possible in a european context .
[non-native] in addition to that trying new things mean that you make a lot of new experiences .
[non-native] the mere idea that she felt the shock during flying her kite didnt led to the electricity .
[non-native] first of all , i could feel like freedom without a guide because i could visit more many places which is not expensive but more beautiful .
[native] the endgame should be the strengthening of the union , not the protection of the city of london .
[native] what is really funny is he use to tell me how stubborn his father was about having to drive on the right hand side of the road and that he would never be like that lol
[native] think about how many non-eu people there are working in the eu and the uk !
[native] it is also the judge 's discretion to allow in-camera for confidential evidence etc.
[native] austerity is just pc code-speak for `` your government is corrupt and we need to starve it '' to some countries - austerity for your country or how the dutch gave back to save their pension in 2008 ?
[native] the same effect can indeed achieved by increasing peoples access to credit because it creates short term disparity in supply/demand since everyone with money wants to `` buy now '' look if there is one thing i know well it 's bubbles after making quite a bit in the most obvious bitcoin bubble last november and i 'm still making money by shorting the price back down until it 's in a more normal range .
[native] > no , because the agricultural patrimony in europe is splintered in small parcels and we ca n't enjoy the economies of scale .
[native] much of the uk 's somali population came via asylum in the netherlands and then free movement of labour in the eu , so the things are n't unrelated .
[native] it 's pretty obvious that you 've never been to the us and eaten at an upscale restaurant .
[non-native] even in germany where universities where free for decades a growing number of federal countries is intoducing study fees .
[non-native] and always doing what you know how to well already does n't mean anything else but precisely this remaining static and without progress .
[native] most of the soviet apartment blocks are dilapidated , falling apart and are in constant states of disrepair .
[native] this is exactly what they do in poland and lithuania too , even for things like christmas .
[non-native] humans have endless ambitious about developing all material surrounded the world .
[non-native] they have already put a lot of money on the advertiemnet and they are not ready to loose more .
[non-native] when they loose their admireing images , they will be nobody like ordinary people .
[non-native] in addition , old people admit that the younger the better .
[non-native] the first thing my father did when we arrived at thhis amazing place , was to look for the best guide he could find .
[native] but you can get all your salted cod you want there .
[native] i 'm sorry but there was not a chance in hell that poland could have beaten , or defended against for a long time , nazi germany .
[native] you do see the difference between that , and making an arbitrary decision to shut down a nuclear power plant right ?
[non-native] english , math , science and the rest of the subjects .
[native] do you really think greeks will feel welcome in turkey ?
[non-native] successful people usually are more lucky with those great decisions , but i do believe that successful people are not only those who take risks , but those who can understand when take a risk trying something new , and also if their decision affects negatively other people .
[non-native] i believe that make young people spend more time to helping their communities is good .
[non-native] so better check carefully before you purchase something .i disagree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowdledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject , because today a specialization is more useful than a broad knowdledge .
[non-native] in addition , we often see a lot of advertisements .
[native] > even marxists warned the role that religion played in controlling the most vulnerable in society is this supposed to be surprising ?
[non-native] second , since most people tend to specialize , the allrounder can have a big advantage .
[native] i much prefer the orange flag , considering it 's your national colour .
[native] life will be worse , but it will go on much as it does now , just with restricted freedoms of speech and press .
[non-native] so will there be fewer cars in use twenty years from now ?
[non-native] all of them , i would not know if i did not go with the group led by tour guide .
[native] oh whoops , i thought you said find a single post for me .
[native] it also means very little as those economies are n't exactly integrated together anymore than they would be outside the eu .
[non-native] but i am also quite sure that specializing on only one subject could be disadvantagable , because it is always important to be interested in and to have skills except your specific subject .
[non-native] because they can learn many things from their fails .
[non-native] it has been for a while since catalog shoppings started , and online shoppings have been significantly increasing lately .
[non-native] if a knowledge is complete in his widely its become an useful istruments for doing right choiches in these critical events that occur to everyone along all the lifespan .
[native] as i recall , none of the reports released from the safety review or anywhere else recommended that they all be shut down according to the accelerated schedule .
[non-native] he thought that it was not necessary to launch missiles from europe ; if it was too far , they can launch the missile from closer place .
[native] yup , during the handover in 1997 china promised special status for 50 years only .
[native] the two government parties , fine gael and labour , are increasingly unpopular because of the cuts that have been made over the last few years , with the current controversy over the introduction of water charges overshadowing all the recent good economic news .
[non-native] as we all know , creativeness and courage are very important qualities that lead a person to success .
[native] with the demand for oil trending down and alternative energy pushes making progress saudi arabia has very little reason not to pump as much as they can for now .
[native] disputed territory is closer to reality than russian soil .
[non-native] new things and ideas and taking risks only lead to development .even though a travel with a tour guide is more comfortable , safe , convenience , i disagree that it is the best way to travel .
[non-native] on the weekend i will go to the communities center for a class .
[native] it also means to deprive them of a right or a privileged , which i would say being allowed to form groups to lobby for your interests is one of .
[native] the title of the article should be `` guy writes sensationalist column on subject he knows nothing about because he 's a hack '' , although i guess that might be a little long .
[native] they 're not going to like it when we tell them to fuck off , i agree .
[native] the one in the uk did n't meet quorum or something .
[native] for the most part , each city is only big or important on one side of the pond .
[non-native] i have more freedom than when i work in groups , but ther is much work to do .
[native] in europe , anyone east of the country of production .
[native] this is at the core related to the toxic ideology of islamism .
[native] because the duden is the authority on the language ?
[native] communism under marxs rule set was much different ... because there is n't supposed to be a brutal dictatorship ... they 're supposed to be gone ... which is difficult to do because most dictators who are supposed to re-distribute the wealth under marxs rules ( they did n't ) are supposed to step down after .
[native] however , not a week goes by in this sub when some cringe-inducing thread about the roma or asylum-seekers is created .
[non-native] that is , all facts depend on some ideas and understanding of these ideas causes the occuring of facts .
[native] here 's another response from me so you can write another essay laden with conspiracy theories .
[native] we are n't going to create a diplomatic rift that ends up isolating the us from what ends up being a pro-russian europe .
[native] oh , so you mean you helped the nazis when they were winning and then helped the americans when the war was going the other way ?
[native] yep , suing a sovereign country due to their own radiophobia .
[native] what i found hilarious was that it was originally for the prime minister and then they changed it when he became president .
[native] > i never called an opt-out a violation of eu rules .
[non-native] in the end , it seems that the personality of the traveler plays a huge part in the answer to that claim .
[non-native] the second reason is more pratical then the first and is about the opportunities that a huge knowledge can bring to a person in the research of an employee .
[non-native] you marry and enjoy the life with your partner , you became social , you became caring and bothered about another person .
[non-native] you will be filled with lots of stories if you travel on your own .young people definitely do not give enough time to their communities .
[non-native] as far as i am concerned , i disagree with the written statement for some economical and moral reasons .
[non-native] some people think that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better , while others do not .
[native] we love our kinder surprise eggs here in canada .
[non-native] due to the rich quantity of products in this society , it is the most important thing to produce goods that customers want .
[native] if we allow this to follow through , people might demand that exclusive lanes be created on the roads for the racial , ethnic , social or religious group that is statistically the least likely to cause road accidents .
[non-native] the older one may have done all these before in his younger ages and may want to do diffrent things such as having a beatiful dinner with his children and grandchildren or may want to have a walk with one of his friend to have a cup of tea on the seaside .
[non-native] the successful people should not think about the personal fame because they are very much useful when they got new thing by taking the risk .
[non-native] a young person can do a lot of thing because he is physically halthy , can do a lot that old 's can not do and because he is young and no one will look at what is he donig .
[non-native] if communities 's contact hard , robber can n't aim at this city .
[non-native] moreover , when you are driving , if you take a look around other cars next to you , what you see is that most cars are only filled with one person .
[non-native] considering the interresse , expectations in life , culture and financial abilities , one would agree or not .
[native] euro coins are fine ( except the useless 1c and 2c ) but the notes are so drab and the fake architecture is dull as ditchwater .
[non-native] that is what push us to make mistakes , we can not leave our desition on the companie 's hands , we have to do some research to make sure that what they are offering is what really is , and what i really need , otherwise you do not need to buy it .
[native] i 'm glad i 'm not the only one who thought that .
[native] edit for the haters , riddle me this : why is ecb not saying how much it plans to expand its balance sheet ?
[non-native] in my personal case without import wich is the objective of my travel , i do not like to travel in with a tour guide , because for me a travel is a moment to enjoy with the people that you want and i am sure taht a tour guide is not always a great person .
[native] > that is dumb , but not the eu 's fault .
[non-native] in my case , my english teacher has knowledge anout anything .
[native] you ca n't ignore that there are increasing numbers of people who do n't want to have children , though ( although i do n't understand not wanting to , personally ) .
[non-native] then , let 's switch to the older people 's points of view .
[native] [ i got the data from eurostat . ] ( http://imgur.com/13e5yah ) .
[non-native] with the increasing population every second the demand and supply of cars are also increasing .
[native] holy shit , is that blue region in china because of pollution ?
[non-native] also he helps the family in getting the necessary household items , paying of bills like current , water , house tax etc . ,
[non-native] taking risks of course does not always lead to success , but the ones who try over and over again will in the end be the more successful .
[native] unlike italy who stays quiet and then just disregards eu law .
[native] ah , great , guess we can just violate any treaties and international laws we deem fit in that case .
[non-native] but i think that in 20 years i think also that in the future , for the increasingly amount of the population the traffic will be a real obstacle for workers , it will become easiers for everybody to take a plane .
[native] we still ( for now ) have our universal health care , and a social mobility index very close to scandinavia , and our common theme still resides in ' a fair go ' more than anything else .
[non-native] while many people may learn these things , few of them try to find new things .
[non-native] i just mean that you should look at the product before you buy it .
[native] i 'm so sorry , there 's nothing we can do .
[native] two years ago in july 2012 we had a very close call , a huge cme occurred which barely missed earth .
[non-native] young ones are always generous to go for some wild adventures and live life every seccond
[non-native] to sum up , to travel without a tour guide is good for saving time and money , also , to enjoy some rare experience .
[native] they 're no worse than plenty of shaky north american news agencies though .
[non-native] all the money is spend for a good use .
[non-native] for example , in school and espacilly in highschool , the best student are those who use their brain in this way , that 's we uselly say that they are clever .
[non-native] in my own opinion is possible that in twenty years we can find a solutions for the pollution using elettric cars or another kito answering this question in an adequate way we need to analyse why society use cars .
[non-native] is it not true that a lot of them sit in front of a tv half a day and watch unknown persons discussing in a talk show .
[native] i believe you are correct , apologies for that !
[native] they 're hardly relevant on a thread about the gaza conflict .
[native] ` never let a good crisis go to waste ' -- winston churchill nobody in europe expects a war but never let reality 's get in the way of a good dose of fear-mongering
[native] based purely on the fact that i am an aussie and , you assume , did n't live at all in europe during my formative years , you have decided i am not european .
[native] the german options from my university include furtwangen , paderborn and wilhelmshaven .
[non-native] in my day to day experiences , i have seen teens and students just littering away the wastes in the premises they live in .
[native] no i do n't watch doctor who so you 'll have to excuse me from your tv comparison .
[native] it almost seems that we accept the interconnected web of treaties and organisations as a no-brainer .
[native] the millet case , and the pujol case which ** is still under investigation and it is possible that results in nothing ** ?
[native] as with bank loans , higher risk means higher interest , and that 's the kind of spirit in which this agreement could probably be seen .
[non-native] we had a a guide who made our trip an outing to remember .
[non-native] all they need is some kind of encouragement in carrying out their duties towards the community .a major feature in which we , the youth , differ from our predecessors , is in the amount of time we use in order to help our communities , which in some cases is none .
[native] nobody is arguing that the woman receive different treatment to any other person .
[native] you are aware that there are at least ten different places in europe that have claimed to be the true `` centre of europe '' over the years ?
[non-native] in fact many people try to not be in a danger of to not risk in ther lives .
[native] all part of the same european feudal oligarchy , but if you do n't understand the context you 'll just accuse me of being a tinfoil or something .
[non-native] i have in mind the example of henry ford : he had the idea , he developed it and everyone now knows his name .
[non-native] it is too unsafe for them to buy in an affect of a nice advertisement .
[native] i want free movement too ( would n't it have to include ireland ?
[native] only 3680 km and 40 hours driving time from brussels .
[non-native] there are many studies done recently to know if other subjects being taken by the students outside their specialized area may upgrade their general scors in the exams and improve their understanding in the general scinces .
[native] i 'm canadian and do n't know what you mean .
[non-native] then , we find them being graduated and being looking for a job with a determination that would be so much stronger if they knew the type of job or the sector they want to work in .
[native] your comments here now are n't even a joke , they 're just tiresome .
[non-native] after few years later he got chance to have a shop .
